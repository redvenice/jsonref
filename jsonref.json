Bathers will also be able to swim between the adjoining buildings.Exclusive behind-the-scenes film can now reveal the intricate work of a team of expert architects, engineers and consultants who are pushing the boundaries of construction to create the Sky Pool.Workers can be seen cutting steel to measure and polishing the acrylic pool structure at their base in Colorado, USA.And the pictures reveal how the team, made up of architects Arup Associates, engineers Eckersley O\u0027Callaghan and aquarium designers Reynolds, are preparing to move the huge bath to London.The buildings connected by the Sky Pool will be subject to normal movements inherent to ten-storey buildings including wind sway and foundation settlement.But the pool structure can deal with these movements by not being rigidly connected at both ends as it can slide while maintaining water-tight integrity.         The \u0027Sky Pool\u0027, which accompanies a roof-top spa, summer bar and Orangery, is the centre piece of the £1 billion development in Vauxhall, south London, next to the new US Embassy         Nestled between the sky and the water swimmers are expected to feel like they are in an aquarium rather than an outdoor pool, as they look 35m down below.

It is a product of unique ambition, innovation, perseverance and imagination, we hope both residents and businesses in the area will be proud to have the Sky Pool on their doorsteps.\u0027Sean Mulryan, of Ballymore, added: \u0027The vision for the Sky Pool stemmed from a desire to push the boundaries in the capability of construction and engineering, Ecoworld Ballymore wanted to do something that had never been done before. \u0027We like to push the boundaries on all aspects of design, the Sky Pool\u0027s transparent structure is the result of significant advancements in technologies over the last decade.

This is a smash-and-grab raid on our democracy, to force through no deal, which is opposed by a majority of the public.Most people in Britain reject a Tory no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson’s government wants to use no deal to create an offshore tax haven for the super-rich and sign a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump.No deal would destroy jobs, push up food prices and hand our public services and protections over to US corporations. And most of the public want nothing to do with this Trump-deal car-crash Brexit they are being driven towards.Johnson and fellow Conservatives who campaigned for Leave in 2016 promised people that they would get a deal. In 2017, Boris Johnson, then foreign secretary, proclaimed: “There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a deal.”But clearly they haven’t got a deal. And now, running scared of being held to account for his reckless plans for a Trump-deal Brexit, Johnson has decided to shut down parliament to stop them doing so.But you don’t have to go back to 2017 to find our new prime minister flip-flopping and U-turning to suit whatever position he has adopted at the time.In late July he promised EU citizens he would legislate to protect their rights. Now we learn the home secretary will end freedom of movement on 1 November without any new immigration rules or protections in its place. Clearly, this is not a prime minister people can trust.Last week the Advertising Standards Agency banned a Home Office ad about EU citizens registering to stay because it was misleading. And the government registration app won’t be ready until the end of the year (months after the home secretary plans to scrap their rights).As the Spectator – the magazine Johnson once edited – warns: “There are worrying signs of sloppiness, even negligence, in the way the Home Office is handling all this.”We already know the kind of consequences such decisions can have. The hurt caused to the Windrush generation by the government’s hostile environment policy is now in danger of being repeated on an even bigger scale, with around 3 million EU citizens living in the UK.Every week I meet EU citizens who are stressed about their future in this country. Sadly, many are leaving – taking with them their skills and support from our NHS, social care and schools.The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, let the cat out of the bag when he told his French counterpart that parliament is being suspended because “we’ve suddenly found ourselves with no majority”.There is an obvious and practical solution when a government finds itself without a majority. It is not to undermine democracy. The solution is to let the people decide, and call a general election.This week could be the last chance to stop Johnson’s Tory government taking us over a no-deal cliff edge that will threaten jobs and our NHS, mean a restoration of the border in Ireland – threatening peace – and cause shortages of food and medical supplies from day one.Industry after industry is warning of the deeply damaging impact of a no-deal Brexit. During the summer I listened to the fears of farmers, car workers, NHS staff and many others across the country.And as Trump’s close ally, the Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, lets the Amazon rainforest burn, it could not be clearer that we need to build stronger relations with other international allies in the global fight against the climate emergency.The threat of a no-deal crash is creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. But I am determined to ensure Labour brings people together by giving hope and confidence that a different future is possible, and real change can be delivered for every community, nation and region of our country.There is a rapidly growing movement of people determined to stop no deal. Last week spontaneous protests sprung up around the country.People are angry that those who claimed we would “take back control” are now keeping control for themselves – with the aim of handing it over to Donald Trump and US corporate giants in a race-to-the-bottom free market trade deal.This weekend, Labour MPs have been joining more protests across the country. People are determined that they will not allow a phoney populist cabal in Downing Street, in hock to the vested interests of the richest, to deny them their democratic voice.It is the people, not an unelected prime minister, who should determine our country’s future.A general election is the democratic way forward. And in that election Labour will give the people the chance to take back control and have the final say in a public vote, with credible options for both sides, including the option to Remain.In the maelstrom of the coming days and weeks, we need to remember that sovereignty doesn’t rest in Downing Street, or even in parliament, but with the people.Jeremy Corbyn is leader of the Labour party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bea755fc8a15216f44237a1e1e275bd825c54ca8/0_48_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ec3e835b9b24b22f384a52d0f16a79b","title":"life game of chance draw lots jobs","story":"The sweaty palms, the swotting, the tricky question that prompts your heart to plummet: job interviews are no one’s idea of a good time. The other side of the equation is hardly fun either: days out of a busy schedule spent interviewing candidates, some of whom you know within a couple of minutes you would never offer a job.Interviews are time-consuming for all involved. But we persist in doing them because recruitment decisions are some of the most important we take in the workplace and it follows we should invest time and energy into a robust recruitment process, right?Experimental studies show how unreliable interviewers are at accurately predicting someone’s capabilities. This is borne out on the rare occasions it gets tested in the real world. In the late 1970s, there was a doctor shortage in Texas and politicians instructed the state medical school to increase its admissions, after it had already selected 150 applicants after interview. So it took another 50 candidates who had reached the interview stage and been rejected, even though many of the stronger rejected candidates had already been snapped up by other medical schools. Researchers found these 50 students performed just as well as the original crop. Once the candidates got through the on-paper sift, they might as well have been drawn out of a hat.Not only are interviews a generally bad way to spot talent, they are terrible at smuggling in bias. There are the obvious implicit biases – sexism, racism, ageism, class discrimination – but others also exist. According to psychologist Ron Friedman, we tend to perceive good-looking people to be more competent, tall candidates as having greater leadership potential and deep-voiced candidates as more trustworthy. Interviews also encourage us to pick people who look like us, think similarly to us and with whom we strike up an easy rapport. The myth of the meritocratic interview allows all sorts of prejudice to flourish.These days, huge effort goes into trying to unpick these biases in interviews. Vast sums are spent on unconscious bias training, but the evidence as to its effectiveness is mixed at best. It turns out training a person’s subconscious to think differently isn’t as easy as a half-day course.This is why it is no substitute for breaking down the structures that allow these biases to fester. For example, managers might only be allowed to make an appointment once they have a sufficiently erse shortlist. I’ve long been a believer in quotas for underrepresented groups where improving ersity is happening at a glacial pace, for example, in Oxbridge admissions.But a recent conversation with a friend who works at Nesta, a charitable foundation, got me thinking about whether we should ditch the pretence that we can accurately predict people’s potential. Her organisation is experimenting with a lottery to award funding to staff for innovative projects. Employees can put forward their own proposal. All of those that meet a minimum set of criteria go into a draw, with a number selected for funding at random.My initial thought was that this sounded bonkers. But ponder it more and the logic is sound. Not only does it eliminate human bias, it encourages creativity and avoids groupthink, discouraging staff from self-censoring because they think their idea is one management simply wouldn’t go for. It chimes with those who have argued that at least some science funding should be awarded by lottery, because in the contemporary world of peer review and scoring grids, risky ideas with potentially huge pay-offs do not attract sufficient funding.Random selection embodies a very different conception of fairness to meritocracy. But if we accept that what we call meritocracy is predominantly a way for advantage to self-replicate, why not at least experiment with lotteries instead? Big graduate recruiters or Oxbridge courses could set “on paper” entry criteria, select candidates who meet them at random and test whether there are any differences with candidates selected by interview.I am willing to bet that, as observed in Texas, they would do no worse. And that there would be other benefits: ersity of thought as well as ersity of demography. Quotas are often criticised for their potential to undermine those iniduals who benefit from positive discrimination everyone knows they are there not purely on merit, or so the argument goes. An element of random selection might engender a bit more humility on the part of white, middle-class men it goes alongside being honest that meritocracy is a convenient mask for privilege.The reason such experiments remain unlikely is that studies show that even when people are aware of the fallibility of interviews, they sustain incredible self-belief in their ability to buck the trend. Not only that, there are a lot of powerful people with a stake in maintaining the illusion of meritocracy. Oxford and Cambridge want to preserve the misconception that their selection procedures embody the creme de la creme of today selecting the creme de la creme of tomorrow.But if you find yourself balking at random selection, ask yourself this: have you ever formed a first impression that was wrong? It might go against the grain, but making more liberal use of lotteries might produce not just a fairer but a better and more erse world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce239c74b7296bf26f846e21b6c228e6b4ed9319/0_82_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef616a35b09623c515d11fff1a51f463","title":"observer letters reforms to blame for exam inequality","story":"What a shame that IGCSEs are being used as a stick to beat private schools (“Easier exams benefit private school pupils”, News) rather than the disgrace that state schools have been forced into straitjacketing their students with a narrow examination system.Certainly, it’s unfair if private schools are gaining an advantage with their results, but please do not forget that Michael Gove’s changes as education secretary halted many decades of state schools attempting to make the curriculum broader and more relevant to students. IGCSEs assess using a mixture of exams, coursework and practical assessments, all now banished on the altar of Gove’s return to a grammar school-type education.We should be allowing state schools greater freedom in their educational provision, which is why IGCSEs are favoured in private schools. Instead, we are in danger of concentrating on the issue of equivalence (always a shibboleth) and not looking at what a progressive government could do for our youngsters.Ian GasperTavistock, DevonUniversities are right to treat Cambridge IGCSE equally to the reformed GCSEs used in England. The Cambridge IGCSE is the same standard as the reformed GCSE and recent research shows that students achieve the same results whether they take the Cambridge IGCSE or GCSE.Advice to universities on the Cambridge IGCSE from Naric (the national agency for comparison of international qualifications and skills) shows there is “little notable difference between the IGCSE aims and learning outcomes with those found in similarly focused GCSE syllabuses”.Universities understand and trust the Cambridge IGCSE as one of many different qualifications they see when comparing applications from students at home and abroad.The Cambridge IGCSEs used in England have been regulated by Ofqual for more than 10 years. Indeed, the Cambridge IGCSE was a model for the reformed GCSE and has been benchmarked rigorously to the GCSE standard throughout its 30-year history.Christine ÖzdenCEO Cambridge Assessment International EducationWhy perpetuate the notion of “top” universities? “Top” in what?

The sheer vandalism and drunken behaviour is seemingly facilitated and encouraged by the tourist guides and, of course, the drinking establishments.I visited in the late 1980s when it was still communist and we were so fortunate to have an intelligent and erudite guide. Prague was a revelation, with all its history, and it saddens me to read of it being reduced to a loutish and drunken destination. Let’s hope this situation can be reversed as soon as possible and tourists stay away if they do not want to appreciate its many attributes.Judith A DanielsCobholm, Great YarmouthYou are right to highlight “the west’s abject failure to move decisively to halt the Syrian war” (Editorial) because the lives of three million civilians in Idlib province are endangered by Bashar al-Assad’s renewed bombardment.The main obstacle to ending this tragic conflict is Russian insistence that Assad remains in power. Were strong financial sanctions imposed on Russian oligarchs, Vladimir Putin might be persuaded to drop this precondition from a new UN-sponsored peace plan. The countries hosting the large numbers of Syrian refugees, who fear returning to an Assad-ruled Syria, would be particularly keen on such an initiative.Would Donald Trump and Boris Johnson support it? Both are facing difficult elections and could benefit from facilitating the achievement of a peace deal in Syria. They could also strengthen their base support by demonstrating their independence from Putin, whose covert help was significant in both their 2016 campaign successes.Emeritus Professor Keith BarnhamFrome, SomersetAfter Will Hutton’s analysis of the HS2 project (“If Johnson wanted to lead the world, he’d stop hedging his bets and back HS2”, Comment), we should remember the destruction of so much of the rail network post-1961.Often referred to as the Beeching cuts, they are better described as Marples cuts (transport minister Ernest Marples was the driving force), which were disgracefully carried on by his successor in Labour’s government, Barbara Castle. It was not just quaint old country branch lines with loadings that could be carried in a taxi or two that went, but a main line built in 1899 with the same motivation as HS2 (adding to capacity) – the Great Central from Manchester, via Sheffield, to London Marylebone. It was dumped just over 50 years ago and not mothballed but destroyed beyond reopening. Another crazy suppression was the Midland main line from Matlock to Chinley. A gap of less than 13 miles means that, to travel from Manchester to Derby, I have to go via Sheffield and change trains. This is madness.If you must have HS2, build it after other improvements and build it like the Great Central, from the Manchester end, and try terminating it at St Pancras to fit in with HS1. It doesn’t have to be so high speed either. My last connecting flight to Manchester from London Heathrow took in total (including changing terminals, queuing and travel out of Ringway airport) the best part of three hours. The train already has air travel beaten. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been accused of hypocrisy for using private jets after declaring that they would not be having more than two children because of their concerns about the planet (“Can you ever male your flight carbon neutral?”, Focus).Their actions are a valuable reminder that, even among those who are environmentally aware, wealthier people tend to have larger carbon footprints than those less well off and that it is particularly important from an environmental perspective for the rich to limit the number of children they have."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e41af993d684962a36c8702655d2859882898f04/0_196_4300_2581/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f896f9a39a4e859869106ad917a44bc2","title":"thank you ben stokes for another headingley miracle","story":"After years of hearing about Botham’s exploits from our parents, thanks to Ben Stokes we now have new tales to tellThere was something about Ben Stokes’s miraculous match-winning performance in the third Ashes Test that felt like a coming of age. Not for him, you understand, but for me. For me and anyone else too embryonic to have been around for Headingley 81.Like all England fans, I maintain a suitable awe of Ian Botham, all-round genius and charity walker. But Beefy has always belonged to the baby boomers. His mustachioed, cigar-smoking swagger was theirs.Stokes has plenty in common with his predecessor, not least a bad-boy reputation and the superhuman ability to reverse the inevitable. His single-handed Headingley heroics were no TV repeat, however. They also came after he had done something Botham never managed – won England the World Cup.For the first time in our lives, cricket fans brought up in the belief that the golden age of their game had been and gone can finally move on. Sportswriter Rob Smyth memorably described England fans who grew up during the disastrous 90s as Generation FFS. Now Stokes has birthed Generation OMG.Test cricket has always been obsessed with its own legends. (Why else does the mention of Bodyline still get Australians so wound up?) Having come to the game in the middle of an Ashes summer, Headingley 81 was one of the first cricket tales I ever learned: the Peter and Jane of my sporting education.It was 1993. A curious kid, I had strayed too close to the edge of the sport, snagged my foot and was about to tumble into a helpless and endless devotion. England were two-nil down and the series was still technically alive when they arrived in Yorkshire. No one gave them much of a chance, but my mum, my only guide in this strange world of men in whites, told me that miracles were known to happen at this ground.Not that year: England lost by an innings and their captain resigned. I can’t remember if that was the first time I saw highlights of Headingley 81 – the BBC was prone to whack them on whenever there was a sudden hole in programming, as there would have been that Monday afternoon. I do know that by the end of that season, I’d been imprinted with the mythology of Botham’s Ashes as surely as if I’d stumbled into a cult.That was also the summer of the big man’s retirement. And so I grew up with a secondhand saga, knowing I’d missed cricket’s greatest comeback and possibly the finest piece of inidual heroism in my team’s history. It didn’t help that the years that followed were some of the most unremittingly bleak in English cricket or that Ashes defeats were all I knew. It was galling to listen to older fans relive the glory days, warming themselves by the fire of memories I couldn’t share, through the long cold winter of Steve Waugh.My generation adopted the Botham folklore as our own, but it was hard to hero-worship a man who was, for us, just a chunky, cheerful presence opposite Bill Beaumont on A Question of Sport. We looked wistfully at images of peak Beefy. The handsome smile, the he-man arms, the effortless swing of the ball into the stands – they were never truly ours. The Botham we knew brought us despairing and sometimes peevish commentary on our own flawed heroes, and was almost impossible to square with the joyous paragon of youth that flashed up during rain delays.And yes, we had our own summer of love in 2005, when winning the Ashes felt as improbable as the moon landings. We even had our own swashbucklers in Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen. But it didn’t heal the part of our sporting psyche that had always felt a little left out. Stokes’s gift to us is that, finally, we have our own Headingley.It might get better still. The Headingley Test in 81 was followed by an almost equally dramatic England victory at Edgbaston. With Jofra Archer and Steve Smith already trading verbals, it’s easy to imagine another spectacle at Old Trafford this week and an all-to-play-for finale at the Oval. If not, we’ve witnessed the greatest ever World Cup final and England’s greatest ever Test run-chase in the past seven weeks. Even if this doesn’t go down in history as Stokes’s Ashes, it’s already Stokes’s Super Summer. And ours, too.Emma John presents the ’s cricket podcast, The Spin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5408cd0b3ca8b88ff00d3de7f4a018f2bb969acb/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82a79484ada0c2aa6065d9479bf217d5","title":"richard ayoade webchat","story":"The director, actor, author, presenter and overachiever is joining us for a webchat on 5 September at 12pm BSTIs there another actor who could deliver the line, “I came here to drink milk and kick ass, and I’ve just finished my milk” with as much deadpan aplomb as Richard Ayoade?Before he became a flipping household name as the painfully geeky Maurice Moss in The IT Crowd, the world has owed the actor, writer, director and flaneur a great debt.

Kirsty Powell, a mother of four who recently set up a Facebook school uniform donation group in Stratford-upon-Avon, said academies were increasingly trying to copy the uniforms of private schools with expensive blazers and heavily branded PE kits. “If you send your child to a private school, you might expect to pay those costs. But these are state schools,” she said.Powell’s group, which she runs with two other volunteers, collects uniform donations for 31 local schools and has received more than 200 requests since mid-July alone.Jane Malcolm, CEO of Level Trust, a charity in Luton for local children living in poverty, said she had seen similar problems with a shift to branded uniform – “which means you can only get it from certain expensive suppliers”. Malcolm started collecting school uniform donations two years ago, and said requests from parents had doubled over the past year. She had even started a “naughty list” of state schools that had changed their affordable school uniform to one that could easily cost £250 per child, not including shoes or coats, she said.Campaigners are critical of the government’s failure to act on a 2015 promise to make it a legal requirement for schools to make value for money the main consideration when setting uniform policies. Mark Russell, chief executive of the Children’s Society, said it was “shameful”.“This simple change would prevent thousands of parents having to cut back on essentials or get into debt just to buy their children’s school uniforms,” he added.In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, families can apply for statutory support with the cost of school uniforms but in England it is up to inidual councils and schools to decide whether to make help available. An annual survey of school governors and trustees, to be published next week by the National Governance Association, is expected to show a drop in the number of schools offering families assistance with the purchase of uniforms.“Given that two-thirds of governors say that their school does not have enough funding to support pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, we believe that the reduction in support for purchasing uniforms is largely a result of the severe funding constraints that schools are currently facing,” said Emma Knights, the NGA’s chief executive.Joyce Tetteh, one of the parents being helped by School-Home Support this year, said she had had sleepless nights after calculating she would need to spend £465 on school uniforms by September. Tetteh, who lives in east London on benefits of £245 a week, has four school-age children. “I took medication to cope,” she said, adding that she had been about to cut back on food before the charity’s “life-saving” intervention. “I was really worried,” she said. “I thought I had no options.”Freema Chambers, a mother of three who set up the Facebook group Community School Clothing Scheme two years ago after running out of money to buy her son school trousers, said she had seen requests from parents “at least double, maybe triple” over the past 12 months. The scheme had handed out more than 4,000 items of school uniform, worth about £40,000 to local families, in Sunderland and the north-east since schools closed in July, she said.“Parents come to us distressed,” she said. “Schools are insisting that, for example, you buy trousers with the school logo on, which are nearly double the price of normal school trousers.” Vulnerable families are faced with terrible choices as a result: “It’s awful knowing that, if I can’t help a parent get hold of a particular item of school uniform, they are going to have to go without fuel or food in order to buy it.”Kate France, founder of the Uniform Exchange charity in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, said she had also seen requests double over the past year. More than 800 families have received uniform donations through the scheme this year.Another charity, Bromley Brighter Beginnings in south London, works with medical professionals, teachers and social workers to provide families with items they need. Its founder, Emma Martin, said she had received so many referrals requesting school uniforms for children this year that the charity had launched a campaign to attract more donations. “More people are struggling financially now, because of austerity. But when a child moves schools – which a lot of deprived families do regularly because it’s not up to them where they get housed – they’re expected to have a particular branded uniform.”Martin said uniforms in her area could cost as much as £400. “It’s expensive and unnecessary. I don’t think there’s any need for schools to put that much pressure on families.”Last November, Kristina Murphy, a mother of two, started collecting donations of school uniform for local families in Birmingham via her Facebook group Rubery Schools Community Swop Shop. After sitting on exclusion panels as a school governor she had noticed that, often, a pupil’s spiralling bad behaviour was triggered by reprimands for not wearing the right uniform or having their PE kit.“It made me reflect: what if you don’t have those items and you’re coming to school anxious you’re going to get into trouble? That could make a vulnerable child quite aggressive and emotive.” These children may then act as if they don’t care about the uniform as a defence mechanism, so that no one will find out their parents cannot afford it, she said. “They’re embarrassed.”Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said: “The prime minister has been clear that we will increase minimum levels of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools to level up education funding across the country. No school uniform should be so expensive as to leave pupils or their families feeling unable to apply to or attend a school of their choice.“Our guidance is clear: schools should prioritise cost when setting uniform policies, including making sure uniforms are available at different outlets, and keeping compulsory branded items to a minimum.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19e7a1c7d96f07f29df40d895033f046ddbfc499/341_471_3659_2195/master/3659.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f94b58e50535ff065025d11e4f390f72","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A rabbit in a buckwheat field and armadillos and snakes challenged by wildfires in Bolivia and the Amazon"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf85ddb65acbe010d614d0d8d595774b35e66f/0_192_4592_2755/master/4592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cffca5f3af3c4ca9cd39acb0f98e708","title":"tell us about your treasured charity shop finds","story":"To celebrate Second Hand September we would like to see photos of your favourite charity shop clothesThis September Oxfam is asking people to opt out of buying new clothes and instead go for secondhand items from charity shops.

After passing on to London, Milan and then Paris, the prevailing sensibility coheres into an agreed style.Only this season, the last of the decade, that sensibility may be about to evaporate. A summer of fire in the high Arctic and the Amazon was capped by something to celebrate the arrival in New York harbour of the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg after she crossed the Atlantic on an emissions-free yacht.Her first duty, she said, was to join a climate protest ahead of the UN climate action summit in September. “We need to stand together and take action because otherwise it might be too late.” She added: “It is insane that a 16-year-old would have to cross the Atlantic to take a stand … The climate and ecological crisis is a global crisis and the biggest humanity has ever faced.”If anyone is in the mood to buy personal luxury goods, it would be surprising. Fashion, which has avoided environmental scrutiny, is faced with increasing consumer and regulatory pressure to improve its profile in a globalised market that is now said to generate €1.5 trillion annually.Selling the dream of fashion and luxury while reassuring customers that it can be done without further damaging the planet is a tightrope walk. Over the past month, that tension between consumption and the climate crisis has reached the international stage.Under the guidance of French president Emmanuel Macron at the recent G7 summit in Biarritz, 32 fashion companies signed a “fashion pact” to emphasise sustainability in the industry. They included some of the largest luxury brands in the market – Chanel, Ralph Lauren and Prada – as well as “fast fashion” producers, including H\u0026ampM Group and Zara. Fast fashion retailers have come under fire from environmental campaigners for encouraging a market that sees around 300,000 tonnes of clothes dumped in UK landfills each year, “We are taking our responsibility through collective action and common objectives,” said François-Henri Pinault, chairman and chief executive of Kering, the French luxury-goods conglomerate that owns Balenciaga, Gucci, Alexander McQueen and Saint Laurent, among others. The so-called pact, though, is notably short of firm goals to reduce planet-heating emissions.The figures are disputed but the message is clear: fashion is a major polluter, and in an industry that depends on human desire for the new, questions hang over it like a dead weight.Few believe that the French fashion houses would act if it were not for growing consumer pressure. Kering has been publishing an “environmental profit and loss” statement for its products since 2015 rival LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, as well as a stake in Stella McCartney – the label famous for banishing fur and leather – has yet to follow suit.But others have joined the rush to publish updated public sustainability reports. “The fashion industry was behind the curve on this, and it’s playing catch-up to the way people feel,” said Tim Blanks, a leading analyst at Business of Fashion. “Fashion brands are being held to account and developing an awareness and sense of consequence that it has been truly oblivious to.”The supermodel Amber Valletta says as much as she appreciated being told she looked good in this or that outfit, she often felt a disconnect between her job and the business. Around 15 years ago, she told the Observer, she “started to connect the dots with the environment and cheap labour”.Fashion, she claims, is an insular world with maybe a thousand people at the top of the industry: “We live in a fashion bubble, but it trickles down in ways we’re not really conscious of. The reality is we’re affecting a lot of people and the planet.”Valletta recently shelved a fashion line on the basis that it would just be adding to the amount of stuff available without coming up with an environmentally innovative way of doing it. “Something went wrong. We lost meaning in what we were doing, and people lost meaning between what they need and what they buy,” she said. “The question is, how are we going to do things the right way? It’s like we have to change the way we make things, sell things and wear things. Everything really.”She’s currently planning a documentary looking at the underlying issues. “It’s important that people at the top of the industry become the leaders of the change. In the past we fought for all sorts of causes. Now we have to fight for sustainability. Now we have to fight for the planet,” she said.To be truly sustainable, brands may have to consider producing less at a time when consumers want more. According to a report by the Global Fashion Agenda, any progress toward sustainability is actually decreasing – by as much as a third. Brands, it warned, have yet to solve the trade-off between growth and managing their environmental footprint.With clothing production expected to hit 102 million tonnes a year by 2030, sustainability efforts need to accelerate to avoid even more strain being placed on the world’s resources.Blanks, who helped chair this year’s fashion sustainability summit in Copenhagen, said the issues are inclusivity and accountability: “If you are accountable, then you have a sense of cause and effect and it permeates everything you do. If you are inclusive, then you have to have respect for the environment.”“You shouldn’t underestimate the work that’s being done at different companies,” says Pinault, who is trying to get companies to sign up to eliminating single-use plastics and accelerate the industry’s transition to renewable energy. “The problem is that we’re all working in our little corners, so despite our efforts, everything we do is completely offset by the growth,” he added.Kering itself, which has gone further than many to manage this equation, has seen its environmental scorecard (measured by air emissions, water pollution and land use) getting worse. The emerging argument, it seems, is to buy less but buy better on the principle that consumers will treasure and reuse those clothes and get off the seasonal treadmill. “Couture is more sustainable in the sense that you’re paying a lot of money for something that’s produced to an incredibly high standard and there’s no disposability written into it,” Blanks said. The recent Valentino haute couture show, he added, was so spectacular that it received a 10-minute standing ovation from an audience where some were moved to tears of joy:“It’s the ethos of the heirloom – the highest end of the market is where you see this ethos realised in a very real way.”Of course, haute couture is beyond the budget of most consumers, but the underlying principle – replace seasonal binge-shopping with clothes that express thoughtfulness and care – is the same. “It’s much more fun because its about creativity and self-expression, and that’s more challenging and rewarding,” Blanks said.This isn’t new to environmentally conscious millennials – many have adopted Earth-saving circular economy resellers like DePop, Farfetch’s Second Life and the RealReal en masse. In a season when the New York fashion emporium Barneys went bankrupt, the RealReal is valued at $2.39bn.“Our focus on extending the life cycle of luxury and keeping pieces in circulation through resale offers a more sustainable way to shop luxury,” said RealReal’s Michael Groffenberger.There are signs too, that the design community is beginning to wake up. Italy’s Prada has said it wants to source all of its emblematic Nylon accessories from recycled materials, including ocean waste by the end of 2021. Giorgio Armani and Versace have both stopped the use of certain materials.“We have years of talk but now change is at the forefront,” said Orsola de Castro of Fashion Revolution, a group campaigning for greater industry transparency. De Castro credits the growing awareness to several events, including the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh in 2013, growing awareness of the environmental damage from microfibres, and the impact of British fashion house Burberry destroying £30m of stock to guard against conterfeits (the French government floated a plan earlier this year to outlaw the widespread practice of destroying unsold clothes and luxury goods).“The negative impact of the fashion industry has reached its nadir and now consumers are beginning to ask the right questions,” said De Castro.A reaction against the excessive consumerism of fashion is taking shape: recently the UK protest group Extinction Rebellion announced plans to shut down London fashion week, which starts on 13 September. “In recognition of the existential threat that faces us, we ask the British Fashion Council to be the leaders the world needs now and to cancel London fashion week,” the group wrote in a letter to the British Fashion Council. There is little hope of that happening, but in New York nine labels have so far refused to stage fashion shows at Hudson Yards, a vast development on the city’s westside in protest against real estate developer Stephen Ross, who recently held a re-election fundraiser at his Hamptons home for climate-change denier Donald Trump . Fashion is worth £32bn to the UK economy and Britons buy more garments than any other country in Europe. They also, it would seem, throw a lot away.In protest at the 11 million items of clothing that end up in UK landfills each week, the model Stella Tennant and charity Oxfam recently launched their campaign against more than 50 million single-use items of clothing purchased by Britons this summer.For their Second Hand September campaign, the pair are asking consumers to abstain from buying new clothes for 30 days, and shop, ideally, at Oxfam to raise money for its programmes.As the Financial Times pointed out, the campaign comes “slap at the beginning of the show season”.Tennant points out that she’s never been a seasonal shopper: “The things I loved 20 years ago I still love. The enemy is our insatiable desire for the new. We’re human, and of course we love new things, and it’s so exciting to see what these brilliant, creative designers have come up with.“In terms of sustainability, we’ve become very indulgent in how much stuff we buy and then how much stuff we discard.”But that, she points out, is not a Valentino couture dress: “The skill and craftsmanship involved, and so many people making something so extraordinary … it’s difficult to get the balance right, and I’m not suggesting that should stop, but we need to be more thoughtful as consumers.”That sentiment is echoed by designers. New York-based designer Maria Cornejo, who has won several awards for sustainability, is currently involved in a collaboration with carmaker Hyundai to “upcycle” excess leather from car seats in her designs.“Nobody is going to stop consuming, but it makes economic and environmental sense to reimagine materials that have had a prior life,” she said. Unless you’re buying a second-hand car, people only buy things because they desire them, not because it’s politically correct, Cornejo reasons.If some companies are jumping on the bandwagon and “greenwashing” their products, that’s better than taking no action at all, said Cornejo. “It’s what has to happen because at least they’re going in the right direction. It’s the future. Everybody has to take some responsibility for what’s going on.”That message even seems to be filtering through to the red carpet of showbusiness, where the habit of only wearing clothes once for photographs first started before it filtered down to Instagram, fast-fashion and the mass-market.Fashion glossy US Vogue published a story titled Earth to A-Listers calling on movie stars to bring the sustainability issue to the red carpet during award season following the UN’s “terrifying” climate report.“Wouldn’t it be powerful to see these same celebrities re-wearing gowns they’ve worn in the past –advocating against the throwaway culture that sees consumers toss away garments after a single use, like they do iced-coffee cups?” asked writer Nicole Phelps.Model Michelle Hicks had her own take on red-carpet tyranny: “It became a rat race to wear the newest, coolest thing. You get photographed in it once and that’s it. And that’s bad.”This week Hicks is going to fashion editor and stylist Carine Roitfeld’s Harper’s Bazaar party in her own 20-year-old Galliano dress. “It’s stunning, so why not wear it again? Why not recycle?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbb1974c1ebbb6bf4c4beae0bb3d9cb93901953c/80_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=952841ea510bc4921f10f7f8ffc4611a","title":"joker review twisted tour de force joaquin phoenix","story":"Joaquin Phoenix provides a comic-book hero for the left behind with Joker, a brilliantly insurrectionist origins story that landed like a firecracker in the midst of this year’s Venice film festival. Playing the role of Cain to the sunny Abel of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Todd Phillips’s blockbuster charts the formative years of Batman’s nemesis, rewinding to his time as a failed standup in grubby Gotham City, when he was lonesome and lost and out of joint with the world. Audaciously, it’s a film that invites us to love the monster.Eyes rolling, jaw working, Phoenix stars as Arthur Fleck, rattling with seven different medications and brandishing a laminated card that reads: “Forgive my laughter. I have a condition.” He longs to be a comedian, but goes to pieces on stage. He’d like to work as a party entertainer, but is fired when he drops a handgun in the children’s ward. Happily, this lowly worm is about to turn. By God, his tormentors are going to sit up and take notice. First they ignore him, then they laugh at him, and then they die.Phillips’s film – a longtime labour of love – was partly seeded by The Killing Joke, the 1988 graphic novel by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland. But its real inspirations are Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, Martin Scorsese’s conjoined masterpieces, each spotlighting the tawdry underside of American celebrity. Joker frames Fleck against Gotham’s neon-drenched streets in a direct nod to Travis Bickle, while his flailing stabs at stardom echo the hapless Rupert Pupkin. Hardly bothering to hide its hand, the film even casts Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin, a cheesy talkshow host who says things like “But in all seriousness” and “Well, that was quite an entrance”. In his wildest dreams, Rupert Pupkin would be Murray Franklin today.Or possibly not, because what’s most radical about Joker is the way it views success from the other end of the telescope. The film flips the pyramid, making its home in the mondo bizarro.And by that upside-down logic Fleck is already on the path to righteousness. He’s become an angel of vengeance, a standard bearer for the underclass in a city where newspaper headlines scream “KILL THE RICH”. Of course, he’d still love to appear on Murray Franklin’s show – but this time he has an altogether different skit to perform. “I used to think my life was a tragedy,” he says. “But now I realise it’s a fucking comedy.”What a gloriously daring and explosive film Joker is. It’s a tale that’s almost as twisted as the man at its centre, bulging with ideas and pitching towards anarchy.Having brazenly plundered the films of Scorsese, Phillips fashions stolen ingredients into something new, so that what began as a gleeful cosplay session turns progressively more dangerous – and somehow more relevant, too. Gotham City is aflame and they’re rioting on the streets. And a rough beast is slouching towards the TV studio to be born.Joker is released in the UK on 4 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5896c86a28b4571b792df99969903d5e6670a30/680_697_4030_2418/master/4030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d375b0eabaf365b04ce089459202542","title":"notes on chocolate dont just stick to dairy milk try something a bit different","story":"It’s fine to like what you like, but for goodness’ sake try something different once in a whileWhen people hear my job title, the first thing they tend to say, after the swearing, is ‘I’m a Dairy Milk kinda person’ with hands held palm out, a shield between us and what they fear I am about to convert them to.

Fellow Aussie Peter Bright is fashioning appropriately bright-fruited wines, such as the crisply easy-drinking, tropical fruit salad of Terra d’Alter Branco 2018 (£8.95, Lea \u0026amp Sandeman). Another star of the region is also an expat: Susana Esteban hails from Tui, across the Spanish border in Galicia, and her wines, including the Aventura Tinto, combine southern sunny intensity with a fragrant liveliness reminiscent of wines from her birthplace.Herdade do Mouchão, Alentejo, Portgual 2013 (£36.50, Fareham Wine Cellar) Although much of what is exciting about the Alentejo is new, there is plenty of tradition in the region, too. Perhaps the single finest wine in the Alentejo, for example, is the work of an estate that began making wines in the early 20th century, and which had its first vintage in the early 1950s. It’s a hymn to the undervalued virtues of alicante bouschet, a red-fleshed grape variety (most red grapes have white flesh) with roots in France’s Languedoc-Roussillon that is generally a colour-giving ‘makeweight’ in blends. Mouchão, particularly in its eponymous top-of-the-range red, takes things to a whole other level, adding a bit of the local trincadeira for a wine of formidable dark depths and spicy complexity that can age for decades.Follow David on Twitter @Daveydaibach This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Burnley gave a good account of themselves for half an hour until the complexion of the game was altered by two Liverpool goals in quick succession, the first a ludicrous own goal and the second a defensive gift.Liverpool will not mind. Their only priority at the moment is staying ahead of Manchester City for as long as possible and they can now spend the international break looking forward to Newcastle at home when the domestic programme resumes. Burnley may not have been expecting to win this game anyway, though having its outcome established so early meant they were obliged to spend most of the second half watching their opponents stroke the ball around.Both sides could have scored in the opening minutes. Chris Wood did well to stay onside to reach Matt Lowton’s long ball from the back and bring the first save of the game from Adrían in the Liverpool goal, before Mohamed Salah struck an upright when Sadio Mané played him into space in the area.The contest was evenly balanced at first, with Dwight McNeil showing he had the pace and control to keep Trent Alexander-Arnold on his toes, and the Liverpool front three finding the Burnley backline difficult to break down. When Salah did get a chance after collecting Jordan Henderson’s return pass Nick Pope was off his line quickly to save with his legs, the rebound hitting the striker and narrowly missing the unguarded goal.Joël Matip had to hook out a clearance from under his own bar to prevent Ashley Barnes meeting an Aaron Lennon cross in front of goal, the winger supplying exactly the sort of delivery from the right that Burnley’s front two would have wanted. Liverpool were trying to do exactly the same thing at the other end when they took the lead through an outrageous fluke just past the half-hour.Alexander-Arnold set Henderson up for a cross, the Liverpool captain thought better of it and laid the ball back for the full-back to have a go and, as Alexander-Arnold swung the ball in the direction of the far post, it struck the back of Wood’s shoulder on the way through and looped beyond Pope into the back of the net. Considering both Alexander-Arnold and Wood were some yards outside the area it was a freak goal, to say the least. Alexander-Arnold looked a little sheepish about accepting his teammates’ congratulations and for Burnley it was an unlucky way to go a goal down.No sooner were they behind than the home side’s concentration appeared to waver, the normally reliable Ben Mee putting his defence into trouble by giving the ball to Roberto Firmino on halfway. With Burnley caught unexpectedly short-handed at the back Firmino had no problem carrying the ball forward to the edge of the area before releasing the supporting Mané, who beat Pope with a confident first-time finish.In the space of five minutes Burnley’s resolve had been broken and the crowd’s optimism punctured. Barnes tried to hit back with a couple of shots on the stroke of the interval, one too high and the other just wide, though it was clear by half-time that Burnley were going to need something extraordinary to knock Liverpool out of their stride.With a first clean sheet of the season in the bag just about the only worry for Liverpool was Henderson coming off worse when standing his ground in a collision with Lennon. The winger went flying through the air but Henderson required treatment and was brought off a few minutes later, a possible concern for Gareth Southgate and his England squad.It took Liverpool a while to add a third goal. Even Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had a go before Firmino put a firm shot into Pope’s bottom corner. The Brazilian had started the move, trying to set Salah free, but when the winger lost control as he tried to step inside the defence, the ball ran free and Firmino needed no further invitation to bring matters to a conclusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d24e83992e81515640a7691714c586f5f81d3183/0_331_3128_1877/master/3128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d29bae3c8c1292f98d9c9436c8aa3a7","title":"juventus napoli serie a match report","story":"Kalidou Koulibaly’s stoppage-time own goal handed Juventus a thrilling 4-3 home win against Napoli, who had fought back from 3-0 down.Cristiano Ronaldo looked to have put the game beyond Napoli when he struck Juve’s third goal just after the hour-mark following first-half goals from the substitute Danilo, on his debut, and Gonzalo Higuaín.Napoli hit back as Kostas Manolas and Hirving Lozano scored within the space of two minutes before Giovanni Di Lorenzo looked to have snatched Napoli a point with a late equaliser.But in added time Napoli’s Senegal defender Koulibaly turned the ball into his own net on the volley to hand Juve their second Serie A win of the season in front of Maurizio Sarri, who was watching from the stands following a bout of pneumonia.Juve, who gave debuts to Danilo and Matthijs De Ligt, the latter in place of the injured captain, Giorgio Chiellini, were first to threaten when Ronaldo’s long-range effort was well saved by the Napoli goalkeeper, Alex Meret. Napoli responded through Allan’s fierce low shot from outside the area, which was brilliantly saved by the Juventus goalkeeper, Wojciech Szczesny, before the home side struck twice in three minutes to seize control.Danilo, who had replaced the injured Mattia De Sciglio a minute earlier, opened the scoring with his first touch, firing home from inside the area following a swift counter-attack and a Douglas Costa assist.Juve made it 2-0 in the 19th minute. Napoli failed to clear the danger following a free-kick into the area and Higuaín lashed his first goal of the season into the top corner.Ronaldo headed wide on the half-hour mark and Sami Khedira’s shot from outside the area crashed off the crossbar, while Lorenzo Insigne spurned a chance for Napoli just before half-time when he blazed off target following a corner.Napoli started the second period on the front foot. Piotr Zielinski forced Szczesny into another good save, Dries Mertens fired just wide and Di Lorenzo’s header flew the wrong side of a post.The Juventus midfielder Blaise Matuidi and Mertens both had decent attempts well saved before Ronaldo appeared to have settled the contest in the 62nd minute. The Portuguese latched on to another Douglas Costa assist and buried his shot into the bottom corner for his first goal of the season.But Napoli struck twice in two minutes to open the game up again. Manolas headed home Mário Rui’s ball into the box and in the 68th minute Lozano lashed in Napoli’s second after being picked out by Zielinski in the area.Douglas Costa and Napoli’s Fabián Ruiz both went close to adding to the scoreline – the former’s effort hitting the bar – before Di Lorenzo’s angled drive from the left side of the six-yard box, following José Callejón’s cross, found the bottom corner.Juve’s Paulo Dybala then pulled a shot wide and, just as the game appeared to be heading for a draw, Koulibaly made a hash of his attempted clearance from a free-kick in the second minute of added time and turned the ball into his own net."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4db80dc1032dd781dea2bf07542f46cf9d3aae7/0_358_4312_2588/master/4312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29da085dce6f0ff0da5758b72fbb9b78","title":"unai emery arsenal searching for soul tinkering tottenham","story":"His passion is in no doubt, but what the Spanish manager wants on the pitch is often still opaque. A vibrant display against Spurs might make things a bit clearerUnai Emery’s touchline exhortations can make an exhausting watch and the person behind Arsenal’s “bench cam” for their opening match at Newcastle certainly got through an honest day’s work. The viral clip that resulted, of Emery punching his fists in the air when the young midfielder Joe Willock sprinted back to recover possession, was viewed almost three million times on Instagram and the club plan a similar montage of the manager’s touchline activity after Sunday’s north London derby.There is no denying the appeal: if everything goes to plan then supporters can spend their Mondays savouring the extent to which Emery, just like them, kicked every ball from the side, living and breathing a victory that would stretch the early-season advantage over Tottenham to five points.Visible displays of emotion are a winner at times such as this and it does no harm for Arsenal’s support to feel closer to the man in charge. The jury remains out on Emery but such moments are relatable and identifiable in the meantime. Emery’s English is improving rapidly but he still has nowhere near the range of expression held by his predecessor, Arsène Wenger, and one suspects he does not have quite the same appetite for engagement in any case. It can be hard to grasp exactly what he is thinking but certain actions are unambiguous.Perhaps a vibrant showing on Sunday will make it easier to decode what is happening on the pitch, too. The phrase “statement victory” has become a common one when Arsenal defeat a fellow top-six side and it applied last December when a searing second-half performance brought a 4-2 win in this fixture and, subsequently, copious analysis of how everything was falling into place. Arsenal had gone 19 games unbeaten at that point and the chant, by the end of a fevered match in which Spurs were blown away, was “we’ve got our Arsenal back”.Yet things did not work out quite as simply as that and the question of identity still nags away. Emery changed his side’s system 17 times in the 24 Premier League starting lineups after that derby win, most dramatically oscillating between back threes and fours in fact, he tweaked it during the match with Spurs, too, a switch to 4-4-2 eventually making the difference.Tactical flexibility is nothing to denigrate and it is something in which Emery sets great stock. “We are more rich tactically with different formations and tactics, and can change in each match and each moment in the 90 minutes,” he said on Thursday. That is exactly what successful sides do. But there comes a point when a coach can be charged with over-elaboration or, an even greater sticking point in clubs with big ambitions, over-sensitivity to what threats the opposition pose.In Wenger’s later years, it was commonly held that Arsenal spent insufficient time preparing for specific opponents, holding misplaced trust that their football could dig them out of most holes. At Anfield last Saturday the suggestion was that Emery went too far the other way, keeping his midfield narrow and deep to limit Liverpool’s success in central areas. Arsenal continued to play from the back, as Emery preaches – occasionally to near-catastrophic effect, as shown by the widely circulated example of Dani Ceballos’s pass across his own penalty area to Sadio Mané – but it was hardly a selection designed to seize the initiative and the result was a mishmash that never quite looked effective despite some bright moments.A literal interpretation of that word will be expected on Sunday and, realistically, beyond. Arsenal have a chance to go for the throats of Tottenham and their rivals’ uneasy start to the season has not escaped Emery’s notice. Whereas before last Saturday’s game he was at pains to stress that Liverpool had the advantage of time in their development, this time he would not engage with the same idea when it was put to him that Spurs are several years ahead in their cycle under Mauricio Pochettino. “It’s a different match and I think for the two teams the challenge is different” was the truism he came up with the onus is on Arsenal to be proactive and, in doing so, perhaps set a mould that can carry them through the season.It could mean Emery returns Alexandre Lacazette to his starting lineup. The clamour had been for Lacazette to join Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Nicolas Pépé in forming a potent front three at Liverpool Emery explained the French striker had been struggling with an ankle problem but it is unlikely he would have started the game in any case. He has been at pains to point out that his frontline have not all been match-fit at once so far this season the assertive nature of his summer signings means he deserves the benefit of any doubt but, when his forwards are ready, his handling of them will go a long way towards answering suspicions that his inclinations lean towards the conservative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fde925a476c78f120a8abc62478de4c76a4ffe3e/0_523_7848_4709/master/7848.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1d03a5e36132dfcef0925695be3bf5a","title":"india almost 2m people left off assam register of citizens","story":"Rights groups warn of possible humanitarian crisis as those left off list face statelessness and detentionAlmost 2 million people in north-east India face the threat of statelessness and detention after they were excluded from an official list designed to root out illegal immigrants.Security was heightened in the border state of Assam on Saturday, as millions of people waited for the final release of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) – a major bureaucratic exercise that rights groups warn could create a humanitarian crisis.Over the past four years, about 33 million people in Assam have been forced to prove they are citizens by demonstrating they have roots in the state dating to before March 1971. An official website crashed as people across the state logged on to discover their status, while others queued in the rain at local centres.Lawyers have raised serious concerns over the process, which they say has wrongly excluded people on the basis of minor clerical errors in decades-old documents. There are fears that Muslims, women and the poorest communities could be the worst affected.Many of the people left off draft versions of the list were born in Assam and have families that have lived there for generations, according to campaigners. Saibul haq Sikdar, a teacher from Barpeta district in western Assam, read online on Saturday that his name had been rejected. He is the only person excluded in his family, who have lived in Assam for generations.“More than anger I am very sad, because being a citizen of a country and having it declared that you are a foreigner, you don’t know where you stand at this moment,” said Sikdar.The registry authorities said in a statement that the list had been “meticulously carried out in an objective and transparent manner”. About 1.9 million people were excluded.It is not clear what will happen to those who lose their appeals at foreigners tribunals, though many fear they could face detention. There are already several detention facilities in Assam’s prisons, and the state reportedly plans to build an additional 10 camps to house those declared to be migrants.Mithun Deb, from Bongaigaon, said his mother, Alorani, had been in a detention centre since 2016, when her citizenship was questioned.“When we enter the home at night it feels empty. Mother is not there. Not a single night goes when we don’t cry, me and my brother, wondering in what condition she is sleeping, or how she is staying away from us,” he told the  on Friday night. Alorani was excluded from a draft version of the NRC, even though her sisters were included.Anyone excluded from the final list has 120 days to appeal against the decision through a foreigners tribunal, but campaigners say these bodies are vulnerable to political pressures and have produced arbitrary judgments.Teesta Setalvad, the secretary of Citizens for Justice and Peace, a group that is supporting affected communities, said the tribunals should be made more transparent, and that a more realistic deadline for appeals is needed.“It is a nightmare. I cannot even think of how it is going to be possible,” she said.“If the authorities are serious about a proper and fair process they should not hold the threat of a time-bound process over the heads of poor and unlettered people,” said Setalvad.The register was primarily targeted at people whom authorities describe as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, which shares a border with Assam. There is significant resentment towards immigration in the state, and there was an anti-migrant movement in the 1980s.Amnesty International said it was unrealistic to expect people from the poorest communities, who may have been internally displaced by violence or natural disasters, to preserve half a century-old records.The process is also weighed against women, campaigners said, because they often lack access to necessary documents, and because the ones they do have are incorrectly given less weight by authorities.Aakar Patel, the head of Amnesty International India, warned the state of Assam is “on the brink of a crisis which would not only lead to a loss of nationality and liberty of a large group of people but also erosion of their basic rights”.There are concerns that Muslim communities could be worst affected. Separately from the register, the governing Bharatiya Janata party is pursuing a citizenship amendment bill, which aims to give citizenship to religious group such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and others who are minorities in neighbouring countries – but not to Muslims.In its manifesto the BJP also promised to introduce NRC elsewhere in the country, though some BJP leaders in Assam have criticised the process. India’s home minister, Amit Shah, has previously promised to deport immigrants, describing them as “termites”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0a4f1754687ba6659982d45b5cf29e3dbc1e741/198_156_2285_1371/master/2285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=390455b854dda72e0d1958d7ed45ab30","title":"if you want to get things done pause taking time out is crucial","story":"Taking time out is crucial. Don’t fill up your whole day and you can kickstart a new sense of rhythmMachines work well at a constant speed – and the faster the better. They are designed and built for it. Whether they are spinning cotton or crunching numbers, regular, repetitive actions are what they excel at. Increasingly, our world is designed by machines, for machines. Digital technology brings them ever more intimately into our lives. We hold our phones in the palm of our hand, but it is they that have us in their grasp. We adapt to machines and hold ourselves to their standards: people are judged by the speed with which they respond, not the quality of their response. We find ourselves in a state of “continuous partial attention” – rarely stopping, never fully present. Such ideas are being woven into our culture. “Always on” becomes something to boast of, or aspire to. The moral high ground belongs to those who get on with things, not those who “delay”.Most of us are busy most of the time, if not with work then with family, domestic tasks or our social networks – real and virtual. When I ask people how they are, they almost always answer “busy” or some variation of it. Busy-ness is high status. We feel we are being “sensible, logical, responsible, practical”. Ticking things off the “to do” list becomes a means of defining, or escaping ourselves. Faced with that anxiety we try to keep calm by carrying on, but what are we missing out on?In my work as associate fellow at Oxford University’s Saïd Business School, I use methods drawn from improv theatre to explore how people respond to complex, changing circumstances. I have the chance to meet and observe hundreds of leaders, from all over the world and all walks of life. With rare exceptions, they feel they need to get better at “work-life” balance – though none of them really knows what that means, or how they might attain it. By contrast, good improvisers always seem to have time, they don’t hurry or rush. They are able to pause. And it is this, rather than an ability to think fast, that enables them to respond so effectively in situations they can neither predict nor control.A few years ago, I became very interested in what it means to pause. I realised that this isn’t as simple as it might seem. A pause could be a moment of silence or a year’s sabbatical. I sought out people who pay attention to pauses: from actors and artists to musicians, film makers and Zen monks. I asked them about the value of gaps and spaces, about how they create them and what they get as a result. I reflected on the place where I live in rural Spain, and what it has that eludes people living more frantic lives. I read widely about rest, waiting, the “Slow Movement” and the nature of time itself.I started to notice where pauses show up in my own work and life. For example, I realised that when writing, a short walk was a more effective way to break a creative block than concentrating harder. When people came to visit me in Spain I saw how powerful brief periods of disconnection could be. As a friend from Oregon said, “After a day here, I found myself solving problems I didn’t know I had.” Time isn’t the same everywhere.I realised that a pause is not nothing. It acts as a kind of switch or opening. As Helene Simonsen, a classical musician, says, “Whatever you are doing, if you want something else to happen, you need to pause.” A film director spoke of how he used a tiny delay to grab the crew’s attention on set: “Pause for the space of a breath or two, before you say ‘Action’ and it changes everything.” Others spoke of pause as a “sweet emptiness”, “a quality of stopping” or an “active presence”. A pause is not so much an absence of thought or action, as an integral part of it.It is not a fixed unit of time. It might be taking a moment before you enter a room, but it could also be a “screen-free Saturday”, a “Think Week” every two years (which works for Bill Gates) or a year-long sabbatical every seven years. However fast you are moving, there is always the chance to pause. To rest, reflect or recuperate of course, but also to appreciate, get perspective, connect to others, listen, add emphasis or have new ideas. You can pause for effect or pause for thought. It can be planned or spontaneous, momentary or lasting. When writing, I organise myself in 90-minute blocks of time, with scheduled pauses in between. I don’t allow myself to go beyond the 90 minutes, even if I am on a roll. Often, I will go outside, or do something manual between blocks. This keeps my energy and enthusiasm up. And when I come back to the text, I often see things afresh (in fact, this just happened, as I came back to this piece after a break spent chatting with a friend).Sometimes my pauses are responsive, not planned. When I get stressed, I have a phrase I say to myself: “There is time for everything.” This punctuates the stream of anxious thoughts and reminds me that the sharp sense of urgency I feel is exactly that – a feeling in me, not something in the world. If there is no one else around, I will say it out loud. Making it physical makes it more powerful. Repeating it a few times has a calming effect, connecting me to my body and my breathing.In workshops or coaching sessions, I find the “pregnant” pause incredibly useful, particularly when I am unsure what to do next. I just say “So…” and leave what feels like a cavernous gap – though normally it is no more than 10 or 15 seconds. This invites whoever I am working with to voice their thoughts. The pause draws them forward, giving them the chance to shape our conversation.You can think about pause as a habit. One executive I worked with would take five minutes to himself, to do nothing in particular, before he left the office. He made it a way to close the day, and leave work thoughts at work, rather than carrying them home with him. You might think about designing longer and deeper pauses for yourself, and how you could create a space where pauses are woven into the fabric of your life or work. But it can be challenging. Some people were disconcerted when I told them I was working on a book about pause. There was one who immediately and indignantly declared, “But there is always a cost to pausing.” The very idea created a kind of panic for her. There was an awkward silence. A pause, in fact. After a minute or so her husband added, “Perhaps… but there is always a cost to not pausing as well.” This illustrates the dilemma we are caught in. If time is money, then pausing will cost you. But what about the cost of not pausing? What about the opportunities you miss, the perspective you lose, the connections you don’t make, the enjoyment you forsake?Others struggle with the slippery nature of pause. If a pause can be so many different things,where should I start? Try this make pause a “thing” and start noticing how, where and when you pause (or don’t). That shift alone starts to change your behaviour, bringing your attention to the times when you might benefit from a little more pause, or pauses of a different kind. Paying attention to when you pause (or don’t) is a different way to think about your relationship to time. It invites you to think about finding your rhythm, not managing your time about composing a life, not becoming more productive. This is about getting more out, not packing more in. Think of it as something to play around with. You can start immediately if you like. Just put the magazine down and you can make a little pause for yourself right here, right now and see what happens.There is more to life than getting things done. Time isn’t a commodity, scarce or otherwise. Time, as we experience it, varies wildly. A minute eating ice-cream is not the same as a minute doing press-ups. Even time itself isn’t a uniform raw material – as the physics of Einstein shows. Try to let go of the idea that time is linear, regular and objective, and think of it in the same way we experience it – as elastic, variable and layered. Instead of setting work and life against each other, use pauses to leaven your experience. Pause is like yeast: you don’t need much, but it is a vital ingredient.I want to give pauses, in all their delightful variety, more visibility, importance and status. My hope is that each of us can use pauses, great and small, in our own way, to interrupt the insidious slide into a mode where we act like poorly performing machines, rather than the vibrant, irregular, delightful people that we are.

But over in Holland and Germany, cargo bikes are how many families deal with the transport admin of daily life – from the school run to shopping trips. (Maybe these cycles should be renamed ‘precious cargo’ bikes to get more of us on board.) Now Babboe has extended its Slim Mountain range, which is aimed at adventurous parents who want the freedom and fun of travelling longer distances on weekend adventures. The bike has a powerful 250W Yamaha motor coupled to an Enviolo stepless shifting system and force sensor, which allows the motor to adapt the amount of assistance to the rider’s own pedal power. Fully charged it gives you a range of up to 37 miles, depending on load and level of assistance. Front and rear disc brakes are fitted as standard, as are super-bright AXA LED lights. Keeping an eye on the kids couldn’t be easier, as they sit in a straight line in front of the handlebars. This has the added benefit of keeping the bike narrow, making it more manoeuvrable along forest trails.

Having often set her tunes in specific locales – Brooklyn Baby, West Coast and Venice Bitch are just three previous stops on the open-top Del Rey bus tour – it comes as little surprise that at the heart of Norman Fucking Rockwell, the fifth of her acknowledged studio albums, Del Rey should be throwing a party for some hot guy, if he’s ever in California again. “Crazy love,” muses Del Rey, audibly shaking her head at the memory, yet nursing some unspecified guilt.What’s odd, however, is that while California is technically one of the strongest songs (there are actual beats it’s about something tangible) it’s also one of the least interesting tracks on this unorthodox, involving album, named after a devotee of lived American iconography, the 20th-century illustrator Norman Rockwell. Rarely has the offer of a party, with “your favourite alcohol off the top shelf”, seemed so unenticing, compared with everything else that’s going on here.First, there are the Rockwell parallels Del Rey is clearly angling for, despite the fact that the title track actually concerns a “self-loving” and “resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all”, rather than Rockwell himself.Rockwell specialised in highly stylised scenes from American 20th-century life, reflecting myths back to an adoring public before later becoming more politically aware. Del Rey has drawn on old Hollywood, summer time and a half-debutante, half-gangster’s moll alter ego. Suddenly, in 2017, she engaged with the world as it was, endorsing Wiccan moves to place a binding spell on the then new president. Most recently, she put out Looking for America, in response to this summer’s mass shootings – a stark contrast to the high old time her solipsistic, dissolute songs were previously enjoying.The six tracks drip-fed thus far over a period of 11 months include some of the very strongest work Del Rey has done since Video Games, her audacious breakout sensation of 2011 and its accompanying album, Born to Die. The remainder of Normal Fucking Rockwell’s unreleased tracks can, as a result, seem a little surplus and one-note – strings and synth washes soundtrack multiple love songs, one of which is actually called Love Song – but there are standouts. How to Disappear echoes Bartender’s escape motif, but this waltz with Christmas bells has an unusually happy ending. “No one’s going anywhere,” Del Rey assures her love interest.The retro haze remains inescapable. Like Lust for Life, Norman Fucking Rockwell’s 2017 predecessor, this record is stuffed with classic rock references: Cinnamon Girl borrows its title, if little else, from Neil Young, while Crosby, Stills and Nash jostle for room with Led Zeppelin’s album Houses of the Holy and more subtle nods. “I heard the war was over if you really choose,” she purrs at one point, paraphrasing John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s War Is Over (If You Want It). Doin’ Time, a Sublime cover, is actually the song’s most forthcoming bop.In truth, the music barely bothers to present itself as pop – quite a feat, since it’s produced by Jack Antonoff, who helmed last week’s Taylor Swift album. Most of Norman Fucking Rockwell exists in some timeless, catgut-strewn place where 3am bar pianos and washes of keyboards serve as the tear-stained mat under Del Rey’s glass slipper of a voice – until, that is, a song such as Cinnamon Girl suddenly unspools an unexpectedly long, lyrical instrumental coda, in an electronic-tinged echo of Young’s famous meandering. Venice Bitch, the nine-minute epic that crowns Del Rey’s latterday output, wanders off into long-haired analogue synth territory.There is nothing on the unheard eight tracks of Norman Fucking Rockwell that trumps Venice Bitch, or Hope… or The Greatest, another previously released instance of high-calibre yearning. But increasingly, for an artist who has made a career out of cinematic mood-creation, Del Rey’s lyrics can stop you in your tracks.In keeping with the F-bomb of the title, and the tweet Del Rey infamously sent to Azealia Banks in 2018 (“I won’t not fuck you the fuck up”), the album opens pugnaciously. “Goddamn man-child You fucked me so good that I almost said ‘I love you’,” Del Rey declares, her unapologetic sexuality in sharp contrast to the song’s chaste swirl of Disney strings and a retro piano line redolent of Carole King.There is a danger here, too, that Del Rey’s songs could turn into a mere Easter egg hunt, given the tapestry of references she weaves, unstitched from their meanings. “Sometimes girls just want to have fun,” Del Rey muses at one point, “The poetry inside of me is warm like a gun.” But it’s hard for any artist on their fifth album to cause you to sit up and pay attention as much as Del Rey’s Norman Fucking Rockwell does, let alone for an artist who is such a past master of the disengaged, dissolute swoon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5a3b8ed588960a0173deec5fde9da69607c437/0_184_4392_2636/master/4392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63107758f1d54ca423dd773bec8c3b08","title":"eu citizens are you experiencing settled status issues in the uk","story":"If you have encountered problems applying to the EU settlement scheme or your application has been denied, share your stories with usEU citizens living in Britain have asked the government for clarification on their status in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

They all have until December 2020 at least to use that programme. Until then, nothing will change in terms of their status and rights.

You cannot find it in a bookshop or read it online. It has no manual or handbook. Instead, it is a delicate assemblage of laws, practices and institutions, built over centuries and held together by a fragile tissue of customs, conventions and understandings. It relies on trust and on a common commitment to its unwritten rules. That has allowed it to adapt and evolve, but leaves it dangerously vulnerable to the abuse of power.Boris Johnson’s predecessors were often careless with the constitution, but none showed such contempt for its core principles. The United Kingdom is a parliamentary democracy, in which “the will of the people” flows through our elected representatives. Our claim to be democratically governed rests on this slender foundation: that a government must command the confidence of the elected chamber. By wielding the royal prerogative to silence parliament, Johnson has struck at the foundations of our democracy.Johnson is perhaps the first prime minister in British history who does not recognise parliament, or a parliamentary election, as the source of his authority. He was placed in No 10 by 90,000 party activists – not much larger than a single constituency – whom he courted through his column in the Daily . He appointed Dominic Cummings to the heart of government: a man who months earlier had been found to be in contempt of parliament. Once, that would have disbarred him from office. Today, it is a programme for government.He will claim a higher mandate than parliament: “the will of the people”, expressed in the referendum. Yet it gave no instruction on the terms of Brexit, a fact Johnson exploited to vote down a previous withdrawal agreement. Once we decide that someone other than parliament should interpret the referendum – that some heroic leader knows more truly what was in the mind of voters – we are walking a very dangerous road.In the short term, prorogation may succeed. If Johnson goes for no deal, it makes it harder for MPs to stop him. If he wrings some kind of package from the EU, it may frighten some into backing it. If all else fails, it clears the way for a “people versus parliament” election.But at what cost? Like loggers torching the Brazilian rainforest, Johnson and adviser Dominic Cummings have traded short-term profit for devastating structural harm. They have set precedents that others will follow and scorched the fragile ecosystem of our democracy. “Conservatives” once saw it as their responsibility to protect the constitution. How times change.Conservative MP and adviser to Leave Means Leave Yes, there is a coup being attempted, but it’s not by the government. It is by a group of hardline Remainers who refuse to accept the will of the British people.These non-democrats are trying to seize power from the legitimate government of Boris Johnson, and install a so-called government of national unity headed by Jeremy Corbyn, and stuffed full of uber-Remainers, with not a single Leaver in sight!The prorogation of parliament by Boris Johnson is a long-overdue restoration of parliamentary democracy. In fact, the shadow leader of the house and other opposition MPs have been demanding this for months. The current session of parliament covers three calendar years and is by far the longest since the civil war. Each session of parliament normally lasts a year. It starts with the Queen’s speech, where the government outlines the bills it wants to get through in the next 12 months, and if it doesn’t get them through in that time, it risks losing them.The opposition then have a number of days to debate and scrutinise , in detail, the government’s programme. At the end of the debate it can try to amend the Queen’s speech or defeat it. If the Queen’s speech is defeated, it inevitably leads to a general election. It also resets the parliamentary calendar, which, under parliament’s standing orders, allows opposition parties 20 days where they choose the motions to be debated, 35 days when the backbench business committee chooses the subjects to be debated, and 13 days when MPs can introduce legislation.Proroguing parliament clearly restores parliamentary democracy and is constitutionally standard. This is not an attempt to stop parliament blocking a no-deal Brexit. Had the prime minister prorogued parliament until 1 November, that would have been a constitutional outrage, and I would have been the first to call it out.If Jeremy Corbyn wants to stop a no-deal Brexit, he has to follow a simple course of action. On Tuesday, he calls a vote of no confidence in the government, and on Wednesday he tries to win that vote. He won’t do that because he knows that he doesn’t have the votes in the House of Commons and, more importantly, he doesn’t have the votes in the country to win a general election. My message to Jeremy Corbyn is simple – put up, or shut up!Labour MP for Derby SouthYes. It’s clever – which is the reputation of the PM’s advisers. It’s also ruthless and improper – which is also their reputation.Supporters claim having an autumn recess or prorogation and a new Queen’s speech is “normal”. Autumn 2019 finds us on the brink of the biggest constitutional change for more than 40 years. Yet a government without a working majority, led by a PM without a public mandate, seeks the longest adjournment for 70 years. This is not “normal”.To me this is the latest, most dangerous, manifestation of a rolling coup parliamentarians have been battling since 2016. From the outset, Theresa May sought for powers to be returned to and exercised by the executive, not parliament.She had to be forced by the courts to accept that MPs should have any voice in the decision to trigger article 50. When detailed legislative changes were required, sweeping and unfettered powers for ministers were proposed. Almost every request for papers to be published or information shared was rejected and fought.The suggestion that MPs should be allowed a “meaningful” vote on her proposals was strongly resisted.The approach to government defeats in the Commons – once a matter of concern or at least embarrassment – became quite cavalier.In Opposition day debates the government stopped voting to defend their policies on any but rare occasions - usually when they thought that they might win.Concern was expressed even in the Conservative party, at this unprecedented but ingenious way of making the expressed view of the House of Commons nugatory, or meaningless, in its effect.For almost three years, government used and abused its considerable powers to control what MPs were allowed to debate and when, often hindering or even preventing the House of Commons from expressing its view on the government’s handling of Brexit.When final proposals were known, debate and decision on them was delayed, week on week, month on month, blaming those who it was feared might not support the government. Then, when the government could delay no longer and it went down to the biggest defeat in our parliamentary history on its flagship policy, even this defeat was just ignored, and the government pressed on regardless.The parliament to which we were told sovereignty was being restored has been steadily sidelined, ignored and has now been silenced.So it is a coup – but it’s just the latest step in the incremental trashing of our unwritten constitution, as longstanding conventions are disregarded and discarded. Dangerous precedents are being set.National organiser for Another Europe Is PossibleAn unelected prime minister is attempting to prevent parliament from meeting because it might disagree with him. His aim is to drive through Brexit – deal or no deal – by an arbitrary date in late October. In doing so, he hopes to solidify a huge parliamentary majority in a snap election marked by a rightwing populist campaign demonising foreigners and what he will decry as the political elite. He is, as Britain’s 20th Etonian prime minister, apparently not a member of this elite himself.The longer-term aim of Johnson’s plan goes much deeper. Brexit Britain is to be a deregulated country, brought closer into the orbit of Trump’s America. Workers’ rights, food standards and environmental protections are to be undermined. Public services and the NHS will, as made clear by the US government, be up for sale. Naturally, there is little to no public support for this agenda, and no majority for it in parliament. So Johnson does not want to allow either the public or MPs to vote on it until it is too late.Parliament has not been completely shut down. The press is still free. But not all coups come with tanks and internet shutdowns. Yes, we have our civil rights – but try telling that to the millions of migrants who face a future of uncertainty, and even deportation, if the government goes ahead with abruptly ending free movement. The executive is waging war on the legislature, and it might win if we do not mobilise to stop it.This government is not going to be persuaded by strength of argument. It must be forced to reverse course. Hopefully, the opposition parties will win this week in the Commons, but as citizens we must understand that we cannot rely on parliamentary process, or the judiciary. The little democracy we have was fought for, bled for, by mass movements which stretched the boundaries of legitimate dissent. If protest movements are not willing to disrupt, they are toothless.The suspension of parliament is not some maverick act of hubris. The shutting down of democracy, the attacks on rights, the absurd claim to represent the people while denying them agency – these are the essence of the Brexit project. Brexit is not the end – it is a tool to entrench power and privilege, to ide working people against each other, and aggrandise the sociopaths who fronted the Leave campaign and now occupy No 10. This absurd, dangerous moment is the natural conclusion of Brexit. This is its true meaning.We are witnessing the growth of a huge movement in defence of democracy. From Monday, we’ll be protesting daily at 5.30pm across the country. Join us at stopthecoup.org.uk.Director of the Constitution Unit, University College LondonBoris Johnson’s prorogation of parliament has sparked demonstrations under the banner #StopTheCoup. But is this outrage justified?Make no mistake, to prorogue like this is far from normal. Yes, a short prorogation (usually a few days) happens routinely between one annual parliamentary session and the next. But this five-week prorogation is the longest since 1930. It has also been triggered in the midst of a political crisis, with the clock ticking down to 31 October. It immediately follows a five-week summer break, during which MPs could not scrutinise the government’s Brexit policy. Indeed, Johnson has faced just one day of parliamentary scrutiny since becoming PM. Should the prorogation go ahead, that would become one week’s scrutiny over almost three months. By 14 October, when MPs are set to return, fewer than three weeks would remain until the Brexit deadline.No 10 insists that parliament was already due to break up for weeks for the party conferences. But this is disingenuous, for two reasons. First, it had not yet been decided. And second, MPs were the ones who got to choose – and looked increasingly likely to reject this. Prorogation denies them the choice. He has also largely scuppered the chances of a no-confidence vote. We knew the opposition parties were discussing this, but had not yet agreed on their alternative prime minister. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act provides 14 days to appoint an alternative government. But the prorogation cuts across this – and would leave as little as 24 hours to get organised after such a vote.So Johnson’s actions are unprecedented, and appear designed to undermine MPs’ desire to scrutinise his government, or even to remove it from office. In a parliamentary democracy, where the government is accountable to parliament, and exists only because it enjoys parliament’s confidence, this is deeply problematic. Hence the various court cases challenging prorogation.Does this amount to a constitutional coup? In short, it’s hard to define what’s “unconstitutional” in a system with an unwritten constitution.Proponents would argue that Johnson has not broken the letter of the law. But our constitution relies on conventions and precedents, not just law, and those very clearly have been broken. A “political” constitution such as ours is a fragile thing, which depends on key players respecting norms and traditions. If they fail to do so they undermine it gravely.The dangerous precedents that would be set by prorogation apply around the world. Governments must not be able to shut down democratic legislatures just in order to dodge inconvenient scrutiny. This is an executive power grab, and when MPs return on Tuesday they should reject it loud and clear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

But tell that to Vasiliy Lomachenko. The brilliant Ukrainian defied a large height and reach disadvantage to add the WBC world lightweight title to his WBA and WBO belts with a gaping points victory over Luke Campbell. Most boxing experts rate Lomachenko as the world’s best pound-for-pound fighter. Watching the master at work it was again hard to argue.But on a night of jangled nerves and jumbled memories Campbell did himself proud with a brilliant and courageous performance. Two judges made it 119-108, with another giving it 118-109, which seemed a touch harsh on the 31-year-old from Hull. Certainly the crowd thought so. As the fighters embraced at the end 20,000 people at the 02 Arena stood up and chanted: “There’s only one Luke Campbell.”They knew the mountain Campbell had to climb could not have been much steeper. In Lomachenko he was facing a man who had ended his amateur career with two Olympic gold medals and a 396-1 record – and then claimed three world titles at different weights in a record time as a professional.“He’s a special fighter,” Campbell said. “I’m disappointed. “Tonight was Lomachenko’s night but my time will come.”This was the biggest fight of Campbell’s life but he showed little apprehension in the opening stages, keeping his right hand high and pawing out his left almost in slow motion. Lomachenko for his part appeared on a recce mission, waiting to find out what was waiting in his opponent’s arsenal. The crowd had expected blood and thunder. Instead, initially, it was more like slow-motion shadow boxing – with Lomachenko landing only one punch in the opening three minutes.The cageyness continued in the second as Campbell continued to use his five-inch reach and three-inch height advantage to keep his opponent off balance and at a distance. If Lomachenko was frustrated it did not show but he continued to have little success in prising Campbell open until a sharp combination landed at the end of the round.Finally Lomachenko began to score more freely with a jolting right down the middle followed a left to the top of the head, leading to most of the crowd calling his name. Indeed as he heard the beery cries of “Loma‑chenko” he could have been forgiven for thinking he was in downtown Kyiv, not east London.Yet it took until the fourth for Campbell to be knocked backwards by two vicious body shots, as Lomachenko went from first gear to fourth in a few seconds. His pace only intensified in the fifth as in a frenzied 20 seconds Campbell was hit by a blur of hooks that began pummelling his body and switched to his head and left him perilously close to going down before the bell saved him.More inexperienced fighters might have rushed in at the start of the sixth round, looking for the finish. Lomachenko, though, sensed that Campbell still had plenty of spite – and fight – left in him. But he was soon peppering Campbell’s head again with short left hands.The crowd appreciated Campbell’s bravery. “Campbell! Campbell!” they cried, and he responded with a sharp left hook to the body in the sixth and a good hook in the seventh buckled his opponent. They rose to their feet, sensing an almighty upset might be about to happen but Lomachenko responded magnificently with a right hook that had Campbell fumbling backwards and clinging on again.In the eighth Lomachenko’s fists continued to contain the greater devilment but Campbell was giving it everything to stay with his opponent. He certainly was earning his opponent’s respect – and he may have also won the ninth round as Lomachenko took his foot off the gas.With three rounds to go Campbell was continuing to do better than most had predicted. But he was getting desperately tired and with just over a minute left in the 11th round he was felled by a right and left hook to the body followed by a right to the head. Again he survived and the crowd were on their feet to applaud him as he came out for the last.Campbell continued to press, hoping for a big punch to turn the tables. Instead he was left hanging on to Lomachenko’s legs after another frenzied attack from the Ukrainian nearly put him down. Still it was only right that he stayed on his shield after such a supreme effort. He will come again. But Lomachenko was – as usual – different class."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0beb25747df649f0fb62e8a4625de154b6f4a7b4/295_638_5535_3321/master/5535.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3b1e4a16545574658b91cf3d6cf6ee5","title":"vauxhall insignia sports tourer review easy to live with workhorse","story":"You may want sexy, but when it comes to everyday life you’ll find dependable is far better in the long run“What’s the best car you’ve driven?” is a very different question to “What’s the car that would be best for you?” I often get asked the former. My answers range from a 1956 Jaguar D-Type and the first Land Rover Defender, with its iconic number plate HUE 166, to the futuristic VW XL1 that’s so aerodynamic it has a fuel range six times that of a Golf. But I rarely get asked the latter. Matters of reliability, load space, comfort, safety, wipeable surfaces and nonslip storage caddies aren’t nearly so sexy. And yet these are the factors that will determine the car we buy, drive and live with. Chuntering past a showroom-fresh Porsche stranded on the hard shoulder is the actual definition of schadenfreude.Each year the JD Power survey compares responses from owners of new cars to compile a dependability hierarchy. It might surprise you to hear that there are no premium brands in the top 10. The UK’s most dependable car brand this year is Peugeot, followed by Skoda and Hyundai – the least dependable is BMW. I’m always pleased to see Skoda ranking well. To the people who ask me to recommend a car that is practical, stylish, roomy, efficient, reliable and affordable, I usually point them towards a Skoda Superb. But this week I’ve had to take a closer look at my answer, because Vauxhall’s new Insignia is more than a match for the Superb.The Insignia concept first appeared back in 2003. If it makes you feel old thinking how grown-up your kids are, then the fact that the Insignia has been around that long makes my head spin. In motoring’s confusing family tree, it was produced by Opel as a replacement for the unloved Vectra. Vauxhall is run by PSA, the parent company that owns Peugeot, which may explain why Vauxhall has risen up the rankings on the JD Power list to come in at a laudable sixth place this year.It’s been over a decade since the Insignia was overhauled and the improvement is enormous. The car is now an easy to live with workhorse. But Vauxhall wasn’t content merely to tick the boxes of a middle of the road, middle ground, middle management motor. The Insignia is more upmarket than many of the other cars it rubs shoulders with in the corporate car park.The new model is longer than before. The leg space for rear passengers is amazing. I can think of few other cars that treats its back-row guests so hospitably. The car comes as a five-door hatchback and also as a country estate or a sports tourer. There is a huge range of engine options and trim levels to choose from. But every model is reasonably well equipped, so you can upgrade with the luxuries you prefer when it comes to taking the edge off a long journey. I’d go for DAB radio and adaptive cruise control if given the choice. Engine-wise, this is the sort of mile-eater that would traditionally always have been a diesel, but you’ll find the 1.5 and 1.6-litre petrol engines smooth, willing and remarkably efficient.Is this the best car I’ve ever driven? Probably not. Is this the car that would be best for me? Yes, definitely.As we return from holiday adventures abroad, many of us will have had to tangle with different rules of the road in different countries. One that can be really perplexing is parking.

While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

These 10 examples have become part of everyone’s lives Much has been said about building inclusivity into technology, processes and all aspects of life. But what you might not realise is that helping people with disabilities drove development of some of our most impressive technology, now mainstream and widely used. As Esther McVey, the then-secretary of state for work and pensions, argued at Microsoft Future Decoded 2018: “When technology is designed to be assistive, it can become technology for everyone.”From Segways to wearables, here are 10 examples of accessibility tech that has gone on to change everyone’s lives.CeefaxIt has been seven years since the BBC switched off Ceefax. The teletext service was adored by millions and became the port of call for checking football scores on Saturday afternoons. But Ceefax actually came about 38 years earlier by complete accident.In 1974, engineers at the BBC were exploring ways to provide deaf people with subtitles and discovered that the unused part of the 625-line television signal could be used to send messages and information – and thus Ceefax, or “see facts”, was born.Gesture recognitionPinch-to-zoom and three-finger swipes to the right and left are just a couple of the trackpad gestures Windows 10 laptop users will be familiar with.The company arguably responsible for bringing gesture recognition devices to the mass market was Fingerworks. One of its lead engineers, Wayne Westerman, was inspired by a temporary disability – a bout of tendonitis. He found that using touch-sensitive technology helped to relieve his symptoms and believed it would do the same for others.Speech-to-textThanks to the proliferation of smartphone technology, dictation and speech-to-text capabilities have seen a broad uptake in use.But before speech-to-text became universally popular for dictation purposes, it was helping people who are quadriplegic or those with conditions such as multiple sclerosis to carry out tasks on their computers using voice commands. Helping a large set of users take advantage of the technology has been made possible because of companies such as Microsoft. The tech giant has been focused on bringing the software to a broad audience for years, having released its first speech API in 1995. Now its speech-recognition software, Dictation, will interpret users’ spoken words in eight languages, including English, Spanish and Japanese, and is widely available across the Office suite.Text-to-speechFinding your way around an unfamiliar city in a vehicle and receiving real-time traffic updates while on the road wouldn’t be possible if it weren’t for voice-guided navigation – or, more specifically, speech synthesis.Screen readers are a rudimentary form of speech synthesis technology and Windows-Eyes has been a software of choice for people who are blind or visually impaired since the mid-1990s. It enables computer users to access the various programs of a Windows operating system by converting text into speech. The technology is advancing to such a degree AI is now helping visually impaired people identify everything from friends and family to menu items. Microsoft’s Seeing AI app analyses pictures as well as text and describes them out loud. So it’s not just tech to stop you from taking a wrong turn.Keyboard usabilityThe layout of the qwerty keyboard is so familiar, you can probably type without looking – that’s no coincidence.Keyboard usability can be traced back to the early 19th century, when Italian inventor Pellegrino Turri created a mechanical typing machine and what’s thought to be the first typewriter. According to history books, a close friend of his was losing their sight and he wanted to find a way to keep in contact without having to dictate to a scribe. In order to use the machine, they had to rely on their sense of touch.SegwaysThese two-wheeled electric vehicles are a preferred mode of transport for many enthusiastic tourists looking to see the most Instagrammable sites across a host of European cities. They’ve been so popular with tourists that they’ve actually had to be banned in parts of Barcelona and Prague.The earliest incarnation of the Segway wasn’t intended for the helmet-wearing hordes, however. After witnessing a wheelchair user struggling to mount a kerb, Dean Kamen came up with iBot – a self-balancing mobility system that uses gyroscopic techniques to negotiate steps and uneven surfaces.Self-driving vehiclesOwning a driverless car may once have been like a storyline from The Jetsons, but rapid advances in technology have made it a tangible reality.In 2012, Steve Mahan, who is legally blind, became the first person to be taken for a ride in a driverless vehicle on a public road. This highlights how people with disabilities are likely to be key beneficiaries of driverless vehicles, even if the technology wasn’t explicitly designed for them.Eye-gazingThe ability to track the gaze of your eyes is becoming popular among gamers, who in some instances are now able to integrate this into their favourite game-play scenarios. It is allowing greater and easier interaction with the gaming environment, for example changing the direction of the camera so users can “peer around a corner” without their character moving.But eye-gazing has nobler origins it was initially used by people with conditions such as cerebral palsy and locked-in syndrome to communicate. By simply looking at a screen, users were able to select words and construct sentences. Former NFL player Steve Gleason was the inspiration for Microsoft’s eye-control tech in 2014, when he challenged the company to develop a solution for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It went so well that three years later built-in eye-tracking support was added to Windows 10.WearablesWearable technology is changing how you can interact with the world around you, and it is even augmenting reality.Approximately 15 years before smart glasses went on sale to the public, neuroscientist Paul Bach-y-Rita developed a device to enable those who are blind to “see” with their tongue. Today, the technology is sold as BrainPort: a pair of glasses with a small camera attached. A wire transmits visual input from the camera to a piece that users place on their tongue – light is converted into electrical impulses that then stimulate the tongue instead of the retina, creating a tactile image that the person wearing the device can use to navigate their surroundings.Brain recordingSome of the latest wearable technology on the market offers to measure your brain activity and alert you when your concentration drops.Back in 2006, brain-recording devices were being developed for home use for people unable to move or speak. A cap wired with electrodes recording signals from the brain enabled the person wearing it to select choices on a screen simply by thinking about them.Clearly when technology is built with accessibility in mind, it ends up being beneficial to all. The powerful message that these 10 pieces of tech, and countless others that you will be using every day, convey is that accessibility shouldn’t be an afterthought. In fact disability is often a lens for innovation. This is Microsoft’s view, which – along with resell partner John Lewis \u0026amp Partners – is operating with a vision to empower everyone with its accessibility updates on Office 365 and Windows 10.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

No one was injured, according to a report sent to Trump administration officials and seen by the Associated Press.The woman walked into the office on Friday afternoon and threw a bottle filled with gasoline. A lit fuse disconnected from the bottle and the device did not ignite, according to the report.Law enforcement officials believe the woman intended to cause harm but the incident was not related to other recent instances in which homeland security agencies were targeted.Earlier this month in San Antonio, Texas, at least one vehicle pulled up to a building that houses offices for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Ice, and a gunman fired shots through a window, FBI officials said. No one was injured. Another building used by Ice was also fired on.Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of the agency, which handles legal immigration, said in a tweet the incident was “another example of the use of violence in place of debate by those who oppose the proper application of our immigration laws”.Security officers handcuffed the woman and she was taken into custody by Federal Protective Service officers. Court documents said the incident was captured on video.The woman, Cellicia Hunt, was charged with maliciously attempting to damage or destroy a government building by fire, according to court records. The 35-year-old was expected to appear in federal court in Fort Lauderdale on Tuesday.She was being held without bail in a local jail on Saturday and it was not immediately clear if she had an attorney.No one was injured, though one person reported feeling ill from the smell of gasoline. The office was closed.The incident came amid federal investigators’ growing concerns about attacks on immigration agencies during a time of heightened emotion and scrutiny, as Donald Trump tries to move ahead with major changes and energize his base by delivering on campaign promises.Cuccinelli, who backs Trump’s hardline immigration policies, has presided over recent changes that have drawn criticism.One could deny green cards to many migrants who use Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers or other forms of public assistance. Cuccinelli has also defended changes to a long-standing agreement that governs how children cared for in government custody and how long they can be detained."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06e78172e6f23f0d0d5a9141612e9d3410949911/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fcc8dd87fa8386ce235541c560eb8ad3","title":"hurricane dorian category 4 florida bahamas","story":"Millions along the US east coast from Florida to North Carolina remained under threat of a deadly strike from Hurricane Dorian on Saturday, even as official predictions for the path of the 150mph monster storm pulled back from from a direct hit on land.Dorian was poised to tear through the northern islands of the Bahamas on Sunday after beefing up into a category 4 hurricane late on Friday. The storm was heading west towards the mainland US and what was initially expected to be the most powerful hit on Florida’s east coast in almost three decades on Tuesday.But after a nervous week in which longer-range forecasts from the Miami-based National Hurricane Centre (NHC) enveloped almost the entire state of Florida in its “cone of uncertainty”, the expected track for the storm was re-calibrated early on Saturday to a northerly crawl at sea towards Georgia and the Carolinas, steered by a weakening atmospheric ridge over the Atlantic.“There is hope,” said Jeff Masters, director of meteorology at Weather Underground.Even so, officials warned of significant and potentially devastating impacts, even if the centre of the storm remained offshore or just inland, as a dwindling number of models continued to suggest. They pointed to Hurricane Matthew in 2016, a category 5 storm that followed a near identical track to Dorian’s predicted path, hugging the coastline of Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, causing hundreds of billions of dollars in wind and flood damages in the US, killed 47 and left millions without power.In an afternoon advisory, the NHC posted tropical storm warnings for portions of Florida’s east coast and warned that Dorian still had some strengthening to do, its winds expected to peak at 155mph, 2mph short of category 5 status, by the end of the day.“Even if it doesn’t directly strike Florida, this is still a big, powerful storm,” Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, said in a Saturday morning briefing. “You’re still looking at really significant storm surge on the east coast, you’re looking at major flooding events in different parts of the state, so the effects can range.Lixion Avila, a senior hurricane specialist at the NHC, echoed the warning later, predicting a “prolonged period of life-threatening storm surge, devastating hurricane-force winds and heavy rains capable of life-threatening flash floods” for the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama, reaching the US next week.“Since Dorian is expected to slow down and turn northward as it approaches the coast … storm surge and dangerous hurricane force winds are still possible along the Florida east coast. There is an increasing risk of strong winds and dangerous storm surge along the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina during the middle of next week.”David Bibo, Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) deputy associate administrator for response and recovery, was more succinct, branding Dorian “a long duration nail-biter”.Mandatory evacuation orders were issued but later postponed for 24 hours for barrier islands and coastal areas of Florida’s Brevard and Martin counties, including the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, with voluntary requests for evacuation in several other counties.DeSantis declared a state of emergency in all 67 counties before the weekend, and said he had spoken with Donald Trump on Friday night. The president, he said, had promised whatever federal support was needed but “hopefully that won’t be necessary”.As the immediate threat to southern and central Florida appeared to lessen, Trump tweeted his fears for other parts of the US.“Looking like our great South Carolina could get hit MUCH harder than first thought. Georgia and North Carolina also,” he wrote. “It’s moving around and very hard to predict, except that it is one of the biggest and strongest (and really wide) that we have seen in decades. Be safe!”Trump was at his Virginia golf club, having travelled there by helicopter from Camp David in Maryland.On Friday, the president had given the impression as he left the White House that he would spend Saturday at Camp David with experts, monitoring Dorian’s progress, and would return to Washington on Sunday to attend a briefing at Fema.Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said Trump received updates every hour during his time at his club before his scheduled return to Camp David lfor a hurricane briefing.“He has someone travelling with him to specifically brief him on an hourly basis,” she told a reporter for the White House press pool, adding that it was better for him to remain in the US after cancelling a planned weekend trip to Poland.“We’re more nimble and all his agencies are here,” she said.The governors of North Carolina and Georgia declared states of emergency on Thursday and Friday. Henry McMaster, the South Carolina governor, was expected to follow suit on Saturday.Although expected to weaken slightly, Dorian was still expected to be menacing the coast of Georgia and the Carolinas by Wednesday or Thursday as a category 3 storm, still pushing out winds of up to 130mph.In the Bahamas on Saturday, canned food and bottled water were disappearing from shelves and the sound of hammering echoed across the islands as people boarded up their homes. Dorian was expected to hit the north-western islands by Sunday.“To those of you in the Cays and Grand Bahamas, I beg you, please leave,” Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said.“Dorian is expected to cause devastating effects to our island. If you wait until tonight, it will be too late. Time is not on our side.”Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4150d4d6bf9c645500a36a399647671b72c210f5/0_89_1880_1128/master/1880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a399cc14a07b9daff84d03e4df871fed","title":"picnic to the wall my german summer of revolution 1989","story":"It should have been a normal family chat in late midsummer in Berlin. Kerstin Falkner, 22, and her new partner, Andreas, eight years her elder, were sitting in the back of Metzer Eck, the corner bar run by her mother, Bärbel, discussing where they might go for their holidays.Only one thing was out of key: instead of joining in, Bärbel was sitting in the corner next to me, trying to keep back her tears. She simultaneously feared and hoped for the same thing: that they might not be coming home.It was the summer of malcontents on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall. The first half of 1989 had been marked by change to communist regimes in eastern Europe. In Poland, after a decade of rebellion quashed by martial law, the government and the free trade union Solidarity had forged an agreement to differ, and then to agree. There had been a partly free election in June, after which Solidarity members entered parliament. In Hungary “goulash communism”, de facto toleration of private enterprise – which made for a more liberal and affluent economy than its communist neighbours – was rapidly leading to a similar attitude in politics.The exception was East Germany, where change was unthinkable. It was an old joke that the former Soviet occupation zone, despite its new name, was neither German, nor democratic, nor a republic. In reality it was clearly not democratic, but it was arguably a republic. And definitely German. Its leader, Erich Honecker, far from being an east German, came from the most westerly part of prewar Germany, the Saarland, heavily industrial and dominated by the Communist party to which he belonged. Arrested by the Gestapo, he had spent 10 years in a Berlin prison, breaking free only as the Red Army entered the city.Honecker had been instrumental in building the “antifascist protection wall”, which he boasted could last 100 years. When I first moved to East Berlin to work for Reuters in 1981, I picked up a 20th anniversary poster with a Honecker lookalike, sporting his trademark heavy-framed glasses, among “heroic” army construction workers.East Germany’s leader was a true believer. The new thinking in Moscow, with Mikhail Gorbachev turning a blind eye to events in Poland and Hungary, and visiting West Germany to rapturous reception, made Honecker all the more determined to enforce rigid communism and put down any protest.Honecker felt still further threatened when Gorbachev, asked discreetly by West German media about the possibility of eventual unification, said obliquely: “Time alone will bring change.” Nobody envisaged how little time it would take.The rest of the world was still looking to the past. That April I had joined hordes of journalists in the little Austrian border town of Braunau am Inn, expecting to see far-right gangs turn up at the house where Adolf Hitler was born, to commemorate his 100th birthday. In the event, there were more of us than them.In May 1989 I visited Otto Habsburg, heir to the abolished Austro-Hungarian monarchy, in his home outside Munich. A fervent promoter of European unity, he planned to encourage a “picnic” on the border between Austria and Hungary, a token of East-West reconciliation, during which the closed frontier would be thrown open for several hours, a portent of the changing politics. That day, 19 August, showed how fast it was changing. East Germans like Kerstin and Andreas, if they could go abroad on holiday at all, were limited to other Soviet satellite countries, and needed a visa for those. The most popular was Hungary, with its gentle climate and the warm, shallow Lake Balaton. But that summer, with the GDR increasingly feeling like a prison camp, many of the thousands that came were not going home, in such numbers that the Hungarians couldn’t fulfil their agreement to forcibly repatriate them.As soon as the token stretch of border opened, hundreds of East German “holidaymakers” turned up out of nowhere to pile through into Austria. An overnight phenomenon was created. The border was closed again, but with fortifications gradually being dismantled, local people gave them advice on where best to sneak through.The East Germans kept coming, and Budapest would not now send them back. It announced all borders to the west would be opened within a month. Hungary had become East Germany’s unlocked back door. But East Berlin moved fast to have the front door slammed: Hungary’s northern border to Czechoslovakia closed. Unable to get farther, the crowds now simply piled into the West Germany embassy in Prague, soon to become massively overcrowded.Back in Berlin, Kerstin and Andreas had planned to go to Hungary, but assumed that border too would soon be closed. So they decided on the “safe” option: Poland, for which they had visas, and a friend to stay with. Surely, they thought, if a deal was done in Prague, the same would eventually be done in Warsaw? They got out the other map.A few days later, Karin Beutler, a friend of mine, grabbed me on the street to announce ecstatically, “Ich bin los, Peter!” (“I’m out of here!”) A talented would-be artist, Karin had been forced to work as a mechanic. Her brother Siggy had spent six years in Bautzen top-security prison for attempting Republikflucht (“flight from the republic”) before being expelled to the west. Honecker’s policy was to punish failed escapees then ironically grant them what they wanted, if only to be rid of “antisocial nuisances”. Karin had taken the alternative option: to apply officially for permission to leave. With clouds of unrest on the domestic front gathering, the regime was getting rid of as many potential troublemakers as possible. Her request had been granted: in two weeks she would be able to cross the wall to join Siggy in West Berlin.Little did any of us know that in six weeks the wall itself would be gone. The day after my meeting with Karin, Günther, a friend of mine from Leipzig, (he had introduced me years before to the Auersbachkeller, the 15th-century beer cellar described in Goethe’s Faust) rang to say that the regular peace gathering he attended in the city’s historic Nikolaikirche, where he was a flautist, had taken on a political angle. More than that, the several hundred who regularly met there had grown to more than a thousand and were now demanding greater political freedom along the lines of what had happened in Poland and Hungary, and also that the right to travel be restored and expanded. To make their point they had decided to do the unthinkable: march on the streets the way West German students did in protest against American missile deployment. He was going to join them. Did I want to come along? I did.The following Monday, after a beer in the Auersbach we joined several thousand marching from the Nikolaikirche around Leipzig’s inner ring road, carrying makeshift banners under the slogan “Wir sind das Volk” (“We are the people”). I still have one: black paint daubed on a scrap of red cloth.The wheel had begun to roll. Over the coming weeks and months the Leipzig parades became a weekly ritual growing to tens of thousands. Protesters still lived in fear that the Soviet army might intervene, as in Budapest in 1956, and Prague in 1968. It didn’t. Gorbachev wouldn’t grant Honecker’s wishes.I look back on those heady days with my own personal nostalgia for a revolution I felt part of. Kerstin and Andreas finally got out via Warsaw, along with hundreds of others in a sealed train. I smuggled their papers into West Berlin. Three weeks later, on 9 November, the wall fell.Within a year Germany was united and Europe transformed, the cold war ended. The people of eastern Europe regained freedom and saw the European Economic Community, forebear of the EU, as their guarantor.But a guarantee needs rules if it is not to become populism. The Germans know this too well. Claiming “popular democracy”, Hitler had used rhetoric and twisted statistics in referendums at every stage of his rise to dictator.He first pulled Germany out of the League of Nations, reclaimed the Saarland (“protect our borders”), remilitarised the Rhineland (“boost our defences”), took over the presidency as well as the chancellorship in the new role of “leader”, and then gave himself supreme power, annexing Austria and banning other parties, all without ever winning a parliamentary majority. No surprise that referendums at national level are illegal in modern Germany. Mistakes need to be made before they are learned from.Peter Millar worked in eastern Europe from the 1980s onwards for Reuters, the Sunday  and the Sunday Times.

Tehran later denied it had made any promises.“We have reliable information that the tanker is underway and headed to Tartus, Syria,” US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said in a tweet on Friday.The US treasury said the vessel was “blocked property” under an anti-terrorist order, and “anyone providing support to the Adrian Darya 1 risks being sanctioned”.The ship’s captain, Akhilesh Kumar, was blacklisted under the order.Since its release from Gibraltar, the Adrian Darya has been bouncing around the Mediterranean, its every move followed. The vessel was in waters north of Cyprus as of early Saturday, according to the MarineTraffic website.Lebanon earlier dismissed Turkish claims that it would receive the ship, which has a cargo of 2.1 million barrels worth around $140m.While Iran has denied selling the oil to Damascus, experts said the likely scenario was for a ship-to-ship transfer, with a Syrian port the final destination.Maritime traffic monitors had shown that the Adrian Darya’s latest listed destinations, which are not necessarily the next approved port of call, were in Turkey. After tracking sites showed Mersin as its destination, it then switched to Iskenderun, prompting a reaction from Turkey’s foreign minister.“This tanker is not heading actually to Iskenderun, this tanker is heading to Lebanon,” Mevlut Cavusoglu said in Oslo.Lebanon dismissed that scenario, stressing that it never buys crude oil because it does not have refineries, and adding that it had not received any docking requests from the tanker.Iran said on Monday it had “sold the oil” aboard the tanker and that the owner will decide the destination. It did not identify the buyer or say whether the oil had been sold before or after the tanker’s detention.It also said it could not name the actual destination due to “economic terrorism” by the US and its sanctions on Iran’s oil sales.In July, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard impounded a British-flagged tanker in Gulf waters. Britain called it a tit-for-tat move but Tehran denied any connection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16f062c3c5ac0e37455115bbedeeaf163dd86f49/0_168_3307_1984/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=294f35de2d64b41b64e3a49d708fd228","title":"what french think of the english","story":"Frenchman Benjamin Carle likes a challenge. First he set out to live using only French-made products. Then he decided to make a sandwich from scratch, including growing his own wheat and catching his own tuna.Now Carle, 31, has completed what may be his toughest test so far: trying to understand and identify with the English.The idea, triggered by Brexit, is the subject of his latest documentary, Meilleurs Ennemis – Ma Relation Avec La Perfide Albion (Best of Enemies – My Relation with Perfidious Albion).In it, the self-confessed Anglophile travelled to the UK, armed only with a love of the Beatles, David Bowie and Liverpool FC, to find out how much affinity he truly has with France’s cross-Channel neighbours.During this journey, he visits Basildon (having been told it is the heart of Middle England), discovers the mysteries of the British pub, jellied eels, afternoon tea, imperial measures and Marmite. As a result of his trip, he decides he is not as English as he had thought.“I thought it would be easier to be English,” he admits, during an interview at the République of Coffee (questionable Gallic credentials) in Paris. Carle is early (not at all French), gives two bises (a peck on each cheek – very French) and commits the Parisian sacrilege of ordering a large mug of filter coffee.“I didn’t exactly think it would be easy but I thought my love for England and my understanding of the codes and particularities would help. Instead, I came back to France and realised I was more French than I thought,” he says, almost ruefully.“Still,” he perks up: “At a time when everyone watches the same television series, listens to the same music and has the same cultural references, it’s good that there are so many differences between countries that are so close. We don’t need to all have the same cultural identity.”Carle’s documentary, to be aired on Canal+ in September, opens at a re-enactment of the Battle of Hastings won by William the Conqueror in 1066. “I discovered it’s such an important date in England, but relatively little known in France, perhaps because William was Norman and France wasn’t a unified country back then.“We went back through the history books and calculated that in roughly 1,000 years of history there have been a total of 250 years of war in 30 conflicts between France and England and millions of deaths, most of them, unlike Hastings, outside of England.”Carle suggests the roots of the current love-hate relationship between France and England dates back to Joan of Arc in the 15th century. “We learn in school to thank Jeanne d’Arc for kicking the English out of France. It was a deliberate political policy to create this legend, to say here is the enemy, we kicked them out and now France is French it’s our country. Even if we know history isn’t quite that simple, it has become the cement holding our nation together.”In the film, we see Carle out with members from the Active Resistance to Metrication, whose undercover late-night operations involve changing road signs from metres and kilometres to yards and miles.“They were mostly older men, Brexiters who said the English had used their own system for ever and they didn’t see why it had to change. They were real rebels, but ultra-polite and correct and very precise about how they pasted their stickers,” he says.Carle says he didn’t want to make a programme focused on Brexit, but he was surprised by the casual attitude of the English towards their impending departure from the EU. “I was there in the run-up to the original Brexit day in March. When I mentioned the risks or asked if people were worried, they said: ‘It’s OK, there’s time.’ And there were no demonstrations. That surprised me, but I’m a bit English in that way. I complain about things afterwards,” he says.So what did Carle like, dislike and not understand after his journey of discovery among the people the French love to hate?“I didn’t like that people found it impossible to say no. They wouldn’t say, ‘No, sorry, I don’t want to be interviewed by you’, they’d make excuses. Just say no,” he says. “Then there were the constant references to the French being ‘cowards’.“I liked the absence of harassment of women in the streets France has a lot to learn here. And I liked English jokes like: how do you plant an English lawn? You sow the seeds and wait for it to rain for 600 years.”The food? “Hmm, people kept saying it has improved, but to be honest, I didn’t find it that good. Jellied eels that manage to be both salty and tasteless, meat pies with gelatinous parsley sauces, and cutting afternoon tea cakes into small pieces. What’s that about?”And Marmite? (In the documentary, Carle is seen pasting a thick layer of the yeast-extract spread over his toast.) “Non, non, non,” he grimaces. “Why do you eat this thing? Is it something that’s part of your heritage that you just can’t let go of?“To be honest, I think the English are more open to the world and know France better than the French know the English. And that means they like us more. Sometimes we French are very self-satisfied and smug we think we know England because we have visited London for the weekend, but we know very little about the English.And that, he says, is a good thing.

He did not give a specific date for the start of the test run.British prime minister Boris Johnson has promised to take the country out of the bloc on October 31st regardless of whether a orce deal has been agreed.Businesses have been warning of long tailbacks for lorries transporting goods between mainland Europe and Britain. The British government has said most goods from the EU will be allowed into Britain without full customs checks for at least three months if there is a no-deal Brexit.Mr Darmanin said some 700 extra customs officers have been drafted in and authorities will also introduce online border declarations forcing companies to announce their goods prior to arriving at the border.When all the paperwork is done ahead of time online, trucks will be able to move fast through the border, he said.He said his services are ready to deal with the new paperwork, the new taxes and the additional controls that will be set up.“We want to make things as painless as possible,” he said.

She wore her hair in a relaxed upstyle underneath a long veil. The bride responded to cheers from the crowd with a regal wave upon her arrival. Her bridesmaids who wore offwhite dresses and relaxed ponytails rearranged Ellie’s train before she went inside for the ceremony.Newly married Ellie Goulding and Caspar Jopling leave York Minster after their weddingThe couple began dating in March 2017 after reportedly being introduced by Princess Eugenie. Princess Eugenie, Princess Beatrice and their mother Sarah, Duchess of York, were greeted by Eugenie\u0027s husband Jack Brooksbank who was one of the Groomsmen when they arrived at the service.The Duchess of York wore a headpiece and a chic black coat concealing her frock and Princess Beatrice also looked autumnal in a deep green, long-sleeved metallic dress and black headpiece. Princess Eugenie meanwhile was savouring the last of the summer in a bright floral dress and royal blue headband. Also on the guest list were singer James Blunt, comic Jimmy Carr, actress Sienna Miller and artist Tracey Emin. They were joined by Katy Perry who arrived in a duck egg blue coat alongside fiance Orlando Bloom.Following the ceremony, the newly-married couple shared a kiss outside the cathedral delighting onlookers. The wedding of Ellie Goulding and Caspar Jopling, in picturesThe wedding was held in York Minister, a large Gothic church and a famous landmark which couples are required to have a “present and demonstrable” connection to in order to gain a licence to wed there from the Archbishop of Canterbury.A York Minster spokesperson said the couple fulfilled the criteria in order to obtain a licence but a rep for the singer did not confirm whether or not they have been regularly attending the church in the run up to the wedding. The wedding reception was due to be held at Castle Howard, the stately home described as one of the great palaces of Europe.Ellie grew up in Hertfordshire but Mr Jopling\u0027s roots are in Yorkshire. His father is the Honorable Nicholas Jopling, of Frickley Hall, near Doncaster, South Yorkshire.His grandfather is Baron Jopling, the ex-Conservative MP, who served as Deputy Lieutenant of North Yorkshire.Designer horses: science rides to rescue in bid to save oldest horse breeds from dying outBahamas government warns tourists and residents to shelter from DorianGunman kills five and injures 21 in Texas cities of Midland and OdessaBoris Johnson and Carrie Symonds \u0026#39set to move rescued Jack Russell puppy into Downing Street\u0026#39Schools rated \u0026#39outstanding\u0026#39 to face routine Ofsted inspections after 10-year gap in scrutiny is revealedSajid Javid to bolster Britain\u0026#39s defence budget in spending review this weekHow filmmakers used 3D scanner to create replica of The Goldfinch paintingBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent: The Champions, episode 1 review: Paul Potts et al were very impressive – but what is the point of the judges?Anti-no dealers to demand Boris Johnson provides \u0026#39evidence\u0026#39 of progress with EU negotiations in showdown this weekRevealed: the first \u0026#39Get Ready for Brexit\u0026#39 poster in Michael Gove\u0026#39s £140m campaignComment: We will only start work on alternative arrangements if the current deal is ratifiedComment: Parliament must give Boris Johnson the space to secure a better Brexit dealComment: Ditching the backstop is just the start -

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOStanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores.

And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOStanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. , The  and IndieWire\u0026nbspall awarded the “masterpiece” a full five stars out of five.According to The Times‘ two-star review, though, Pitt is “as blank as he’s ever been” in the “tedious” film with The Hollywood Reporter calling it “stubbornly uninvolving”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspVanity Fair levelled that, while the film is a visual stunner, it fails to offer anything new to the science-fiction genre.New Terminator trailer erases memory of dreadful sequelsNew Terminator trailer erases memory of dreadful sequelsThis year’s first true Oscar contender has emergedStarring in the film alongside Pitt is Tommy Lee Jones, Ruth Negga, Liv Tyler and Donald Sutherland.Director James Gray is best known for films\u0026nbspThe Immigrant\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspWe Own the Night.

But, he tells Andy Martin, he’s proud of building an ‘unknown little British tech company’ that can take on the likes of giants like AppleClick to followThe IndependentJohn Shermer, the founder of Lightwave, had some of his best ideas in borstal. He was teaching delinquent teenagers in Birmingham back in the 1980s. “I used to think software was some kind of lingerie.”Then he discovered the Acorn BBC Micro. “There was this kid, aged 16, put away for a double murder. He couldn’t read or write. He’d pick a fight rather than answer a question. But if you put him in front of a computer, his behaviour changed – for the better.”If he got it wrong, he could start again. “He could fail without humiliation,” says Shermer when we meet up in London. The computer had infinite patience and it wasn’t judgemental.Which is what gave him the idea to build a dedicated computer room for the other inmates and develop what became known as “Tech4Good”, inspiring otherwise underskilled young people. Working for the NHS with EU funding, he was soon tailoring tech around Europe to improve the lives of anyone with a disability.There was a man in Antwerp with a brainstem injury who could only twitch a finger: Shermer dreamed up a glove with sensors that enabled him to type. He adapted a Psion organiser to give a voice to a woman who had lost the power of speech. The victim of a road accident who could only move his chin was able to operate a keyboard Shermer had tweaked. “The tragedy was that these were one-offs and not generally available.”And everything cost too much. He made a plug-in power outlet you could control with the blink of an eye (literally). But each unit cost £150 each and he could only make a few hundred.The idea of starting his own company was to bring the price down and make more units and make them for anyone and everyone, with or without a disability. “My wife was appalled when I quit.” But he got the price down to £10 per unit and was making 10,000 at a time. “The NHS was spending millions but I didn’t think they were spending it wisely.”Now 63, Shermer was born in West Bromwich. His father worked on Spaghetti Junction and the young Shermer would go to the factory on a Saturday to watch him putting it together. He built his own hi-fi from scratch aged 11. He was chronically dyslexia (as are his own children) but was saved by predictive typing and audiobooks. Shermer describes his job as “liberating people”.He was inspired in part by a meeting with Stephen Hawking in the mid-90s at the Dorchester in London, when they talked about the future of disability and tech. Lightwave started off, 12 years ago, enabling NHS patients to be independent at home.Even if they couldn’t move too well they could still turn the lights on and off and answer the phone. It was smart home technology before it became fashionable. “We changed the lives of thousands of people,” he says. “You had to make it simple and it had to be robust: people’s lives depended on it.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The fundamental physics is flawed. The waves won’t go through walls. The frequency is wrong.” Lightwave uses a dedicated radio protocol.The emergence of the smartphone transformed the business for Shermer. “It’s democratising,” he says. Anyone can use their phone to control all the appliances in their home, remotely. In January 2012 Lightwave produced a pioneering “gateway” device for a house. “We made all the mistakes,” he says, “but now it works.”Lightwave is still based in Birmingham and uses local engineers and they design all their own apps. He started with two employees and now it’s up to 60-plus. He reckons that dyslexia helps you in some ways. “I can’t write long reports but I can stand and talk all day long. I can’t code either, but I do have the ideas.” He carries a “daybook” around with him in which he sets down his latest brainwave.Shermer is proud of being “an unknown little British tech company” up against the giants of the industry. “They’re still getting it wrong,” he says. Apple invited him to Ireland for talks. They wanted to put an Apple chip in all his products and gave him 48 hours to consider. Shermer said he didn’t need 48 hours and turned them down flat. “We’re dealing with people’s lives,” he said. “It has to work.” Now Lightwave products are on sale in Apple stores.How two childhood friends became sports-pub matchmakers‘Don’t be afraid of AI’: Daniel Pitchford debunks technology mythsHow Daniel Nivern created an international recruitment agency in ChinaWhether you have dementia or you’re easily distracted, it’s useful to have the kind of kit that can spot if you left the cooker on.\u0026nbsp “We don’t make gadgets,” Shermer says dismissively. “We make things that screw to the fabric of your house. Stuff that’s permanent and increases the value of your home.” Lightwave are also collaborating with housing providers and companies like Honeywell to create iPhone-ready homes. The technology is built into the architecture.Shermer now works with the likes of Google and Amazon. “But we stand our corner,” he says. He reckons that the larger companies are at a disadvantage in that they produce generic products, whereas Lightwave can be more bespoke. “They’re top-down, whereas we grew up looking at it from the user’s point of view.”Shermer reckons he could also come up with a much better system for Hawking if he was still around. “It was a slow, stilted conversation with him. He would take a minute to say ‘I agree’. And it was an American voice system. There are still tens of thousands in his situation who would benefit.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Friends, family, you know the drill. \u0026nbspIt will lend up to £10,000 at an APR interest rate of just under 50 per cent.\u0026nbspBusiness was booming until quite recently, with a successful flotation at 275p, which made a billionaire of founder James Benamor and attracted some big name investors.\u0026nbspSince then, it has been a rocky ride. Before yesterday’s update, the shares were trading at less than half their near 300p peak. They’ve since halved again.\u0026nbspBritain will pay a big price for Boris Johnson’s Brexit coupA major reason for that is this sort of lending coming under the beady eye\u0026nbspof the Financial Conduct Authority.\u0026nbspThe regulator has voiced concerns about the growth of the market, the loans’ affordability, the high incidence of repeat loans lenders like Amigo have on their books.\u0026nbspHard-up borrowers can easily get into a cycle of borrowing, and then borrowing again, which sucks money out of already strained budgets.\u0026nbspThe watchdog also worries about whether guarantors really know what they’re getting into. They are themselves often of limited means. Becoming liable for a loved one’s loan repayments is a headache many of them could do without.\u0026nbspYou can see why investors initially got excited by the company. It currently has 210,000 customers. There could be 10 million of them in its sector. Amigo and its peers have created a market among them that barely existed before its emergence, one that has been booming. Whether that’s a good thing is open to debate.\u0026nbspThe problem with the “subprime” sector is that there is within it a substantial number of people who really shouldn’t be borrowing at all, who are inclined to take out loans to make ends meet rather than to fulfil a purpose (such as buying a car to get a better job). \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A notable feature of the results is an impairment ratio of more than\u0026nbsp30 per cent of revenues, up from 25.4 per cent and a deterioration of the proportion of loan balances fully up to date or less than 31 days overdue.\u0026nbspWhat can Britain learn from a Breton town’s bustling centre?Why the Bank of Mum and Dad is now a top 10 mortgage lenderM\u0026ampS faces ejection from the top tier of British businessIf that were so, why the need for a reset, which involves improving “credit and conduct policies” and prioritising new customers over relending to existing ones?The watchdog has already capped what payday lenders can charge. It followed up with a move on stores operating in the “rent to own” sector. The charges imposed on those whose bank accounts slip into the red via “unauthorised” overdrafts have similarly been addressed.\u0026nbsp“You can expect us to be consistent and predictable in our focus on affordability,” is what it has said on the subject of guarantor loans.

A dream come true, says David Barnett, but it won’t be an easy taskClick to followThe IndependentAt a time when comic book movies rule the box office, it makes sense that one of the most beloved series in recent years gets an adaptation, courtesy of Netflix.When it’s a comic that was written by Neil Gaiman, the man behind book-to-TV hits American Gods and (co-authored with Terry Pratchett) Good Omens, it seems even more of a no-brainer.But while the comic in question, Sandman, holds a special place in the hearts of readers of both the hardcore geek variety and those who would never class themselves as comic nerds, its journey to the screen has been a troubled one and for many years the series was dismissed as simply unfilmable.When DC Comics published the first issue of The Sandman, with a cover date of January 1989, the industry was in the throes of a revolution.Titles such as Watchmen and The Dark Knight\u0026nbspReturns\u0026nbspheralded a new direction.\u0026nbspIt was proclaimed “Comics aren’t for kids any more!” as the superhero genre became grittier and darker, drenched in sex and violence that was much more than a sock on\u0026nbspthe jaw and a KA-POW!\u0026nbspSound effect.Created with Sketch. Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.DC Comics, once the home of corny, brightly-coloured heroes such as Plastic Man and Arm-Fall-Off-Boy (no… really.\u0026nbspHe could take his arm off and hit people with it), was getting cool again. And that was largely thanks to a concerted effort\u0026nbspto bring in British writers and artists to overhaul some of their tired old plotlines and dream up brand new characters.tired tropes\u0026nbsp(DC Comics)A little before Sandman was published, DC brought out a comic called Hellblazer, featuring a British, street-level occultist called John Constantine who smoked and drank and screwed people over. Written by Jamie Delano, with art by John Ridgway, it set the tone for what was to come. In late 1988, DC started running ads for Sandman in the back of its comics. They showed a twinkle-eyed, pale-faced figure and the slogan, “I will show you terror in a handful of dust”.\u0026nbspIt was written by Neil Gaiman, with art initially by Sam Kieth and Mike Dringenberg and covers by Dave McKean. The advertising blurb was a slight mangling of a quote from TS Eliot’s “The Waste Land”. Gaiman was a name that no one outside of comics would have recognised at that point he’d been brought over to work for DC by forward-thinking editor Karen Berger after a smattering of comics work, including a graphic novel with the aforementioned McKean called Violent Cases. Sandman was published in the same format as the usual DC superhero comics, and billed as a “horror-edged fantasy”.Neil Gaiman: ‘I made Good Omens for Terry Pratchett’Sandman certainly wasn’t about superheroes, though they sometimes featured in slightly grotesque ways. It wasn’t really a horror comic, though it was often horrific. It was fantastical rather than the epic fantasy of the doorstep-sized novels that filled the bookstores. If it wasn’t these things, then what was Sandman all about?The clever answer is that it’s about everything. In 75 monthly issues, from 1988 to 1996, Sandman covered every conceivable topic, from myth and legend to love and loss to identity politics to horror to birth and death to cats that hunt humans and dogs that talk. In a narrower sense, it’s about the Sandman, also known as\u0026nbspMorpheus\u0026nbspor Dream, one of a group of immortal siblings known as the Endless who rule over realms that correspond to, really, the components of the human heart. Alongside Dream, the roll call\u0026nbspincludes Destiny, Despair, Delirium, Destruction, Desire and, of course, Death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He rules over his domain where humans visit, fleetingly, as their bodies rest. He’s actually – whisper it – a bit boring. He doesn’t have much of a sense of humour, isn’t given to snappy rejoinders, and is often brooding over something, some lost love or threat to his realm. So it’s a good job that The Sandman comics are not really very often about him. They’re about the humans who interact with him, and their stories, their lives, which Dream sometimes just witnesses, and sometimes intervenes in.30th anniversary of the first issue\u0026nbsp(DC ComicsVertigo)Though Sandman is a narrative that covers much territory, not always in linear fashion, there is a silver thread running through all 75 issues (later collected into omnibus editions for easier reading) which begins with our introduction to Morpheus,\u0026nbspimprisoned for decades by an opportunistic Aleister Crowley-like English occultist. When he’s finally free, the Lord of Dreams returns to his realm to find it crumbling and in disarray, and sets out to retrieve his objects of power, fix things up, and make right all the chaos that has occurred in his absence.Gaiman was pretty much\u0026nbspunknown when he started writing Sandman (Getty)In early issues, he has to track down the denizens of his domain who have escaped while he’s been gone, and travel to hell to free a lover he wronged thousands of years previously. He meets Shakespeare and gods\u0026nbspand ordinary people thrust into ordinary situations. The series ends with his death but like everything that went before, nothing is as it seems in the land of dreams.The series was an instant hit. It was the comic for people who didn’t read comics, and the comic for those that did. Gaiman must have cast some bewitching hex, because he managed to build a fanbase that was full of cool people and outsiders and comic nerds and punks and pretty much everybody. Everybody loved Sandman. The singer-songwriter Tori Amos loved Sandman. The great American man of letters Norman Mailer called Sandman “a comic strip for intellectuals”. Charles Shaar Murray, the music journalist and author, writing in this very newspaper in 1997, on the release of the final volume of the collected Sandman story, called it “a major achievement. There is nothing quite like it anywhere else.”A plethora of artists have illustrated the Sandman comics. They include Colleen Doran, Jill Thompson, Bryan Talbot, Mark Buckingham, Malcolm Jones III, Charles Vess, Kelley Jones, Matt Wagner, P Craig Russell, and more. All have brought their own touch to Dream and the Endless, but of course the one constant has always been writer Neil Gaiman.In a way, Sandman is a timeless tale\u0026nbsp… And, as you’d expect, many of the stories within the wider narrative deal with how we dream, how dreams affect reality and vice versa, and what happens if we don’t dream… or dream too hardGaiman was pretty much an unknown when he started writing Sandman. He wasn’t even that well known a year or so later when he published, along with Terry Pratchett, the novel Good Omens. By the year 2001, when his first proper solo novel, American Gods, was out, he was a little better known, enough to be interviewed by CNN. He demurred at the suggestions that he was now famous, commenting:\u0026nbsp“I’m not and never will be a John Grisham.”Still, he had his fanbase by then, and it was quite a wide-ranging one. He is quoted in the same interview as describing his market as “a handful of beautiful goths and a handful of boys in dresses and a handful of sci-fi fans and a handful of nervous young girls with multicoloured hair and the people who look normal and the people who look like somebody’s mum. I exist at the intersection of a dozen Venn diagrams.”Now, though, it could be argued that Gaiman has certainly achieved Grisham-esque levels of literary fame, certainly since his 2013 novel The Ocean at the End of the Lane took up residence at the top of the bestseller lists. From then on,\u0026nbspGaiman\u0026nbspbecame a hot property.His works Stardust and Coraline have been adapted into movies, but it wasn’t until the rise of the big-budget, ambitious TV series, heralded by the likes of Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead, that his oeuvre found its natural home. American Gods and Good Omens have both been adapted for TV on Amazon Prime, and Sandman is next, snapped up by Netflix earlier this month.It’s not quite a case of a goldrush to mine Gaiman’s back catalogue for new hits though. For starters, unlike most of his other work, Sandman isn’t Gaiman’s copyright he did the work for DC comics, and the characters he wrote and created belong to them. DC certainly hasn’t been resting on its laurels with turning its intellectual property into TV shows… series such as Arrow, Supergirl, The Flash, Titans\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDoom Patrol have been big hits. Shows that are more thematically aligned to Sandman, such as Constantine, based on the comic Hellblazer, appeared, while another adaptation at the darker end of the DC universe, Swamp Thing, has just debuted.Tennant and Michael Sheen in ‘Good Omens’, which Gaiman co-wrote with Terry Pratchett\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp(BBCAmazon)People have been trying to get Sandman on to the screen for almost as long as the comic has been produced. From the late 1990s, Warner Bros, which owns DC Comics, had been trying to get a Sandman movie made. Roger Avary, who worked alongside Quentin Tarantino on Pulp Fiction, was slated to direct, but fell out with the company and it never happened. New attempts were made one screenplay sent to Gaiman is said to have evoked the response from him that it was “not only the worst Sandman script I’ve ever seen, but quite easily the worst script I’ve ever read”.By 2013, when Sandman had been in and out of development hell more often than the character had been in actual hell (which was quite frequently the TV series Lucifer, starring Tom Ellis, is essentially a spin-off series of Sandman, featuring the version of Satan that Gaiman created for the comic), something more concrete appeared to be on the cards. Producer David S Goyer announced that he would be leading a film adaptation, working with actor and filmmaker Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Gaiman, with British screenwriter Jack Thorne on script duties.spinoff featuring Satan from ‘Sandman’ and his adventures on Earth (Fox)It underwent several rewrites and by 2016 Gordon-Levitt dropped out of the project, citing differences with the studio over how he thought the direction of the movie should go. The adaptation petered out, with the general feeling that the scope and breadth of Sandman was just too ambitious to be contained in the movie format.Good Omens review: Pratchett \u0026amp Gaiman’s whimsical book brought to lifeEnter, not Sandman, but Netflix. On 30 June\u0026nbspit was announced in Hollywood Reporter that the adaptation was back on, only as an ongoing series on the streaming TV provider, not as a movie. Which is pretty much the best result for a story of this size. David Goyer is back on board, as is Gaiman, whose stock in the TV world has massively risen since the adaptations of Good Omens and American Gods, which he\u0026nbspexecutively produced.One possible question mark people might have over the adaptation is whether the Sandman story has any relevance in 2019, more than 20 years after the main series ended (there have been many spinoffs, and DC recently launched a Sandman Universe\u0026nbspof titles featuring the characters, overseen by Gaiman but created by a new team of comic writers and artists). Good Omens is of a similar vintage to Sandman, but its apocalyptic themes were frighteningly recognisable in this year’s Amazon Prime adaptation, and American Gods was brought up to date nicely with its story of the old gods fading as faith in them wanes, and the new gods of technology, money and sex on the rise.Starz’s ‘American Gods’, Gaiman’s first solo novel\u0026nbsp(Starz)In a way, Sandman is a timeless tale. It’s character-driven rather than plot-heavy, which suits the Netflix model of delving into characters’ backstories and fleshing out the source material it adapts. And, as you’d expect, many of the stories within the wider narrative deal with how we dream, how dreams affect reality and vice versa, and what happens if we don’t dream… or dream too hard. And dreams are not merely the stories we tell ourselves in our sleep they can be hopes and ambitions and wishes for ourselves and others. Perhaps there’s something to be said, also, about how willingly we submit to non-real states, especially online, which wasn’t a real consideration when Gaiman first wrote the series.Overall, Netflix certainly seems a safe pair of hands, and if anyone can do justice to the sprawling story of Dream and the Endless, then this old comics fan thinks it’ll probably be them. Another misgiving aficionados of the comics might have is that over its 75 issues, The\u0026nbspSandman didn’t really plough the sort of neat, linear furrow that TV series like to follow. Sandman is about everything, and that’s sometimes a big ask for a TV show to take on… and which led to the general opinion that it was simply not a thing you could adapt.It’s also a truth that great comics – or novels, for that matter – don’t necessarily make great TV shows or movies. To revisit an earlier point, a comic book isn’t just illustrated fiction. It’s a collaborative medium, it’s its own way of telling stories. It’s writing and art that come together to make a way of communicating a narrative that is different from anything else. Sometimes, that story is best suited to the form in which it was first birthed. And even if it all goes wrong, at least we still have the comics.But people are undeniably excited about a Sandman TV show. The beautiful goths, boys in dresses, sci-fi fans, nervous young girls with multicoloured hair and the people who look normal who were Gaiman’s turn of the millennium fanbase. As will, finally, thanks to Gaiman rapidly becoming a household name, “the people who look like somebody’s mom”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It is not mentioned when the smartphone will come to Europe, though it will likely be around the same time as the US.A spokesperson for Samsung refused to confirm further details when contacted by\u0026nbspThe Independent.Inside Samsung’s pivotal struggle to deliver Galaxy FoldThe Galaxy Fold marks a major departure from the slab-like design of smartphones that has become standard over the last decade.Other smartphone makers have been developing foldable phones, including the world\u0027s second largest smartphone maker Huawei.\u0026nbspThe Chinese manufacturer was also forced to delay the launch of the Mate Flex due to similar concerns about its design.One of the main issues with the new design is with the integrated hinge and flexible screen that needs to survive thousands of folds within the typical life  of a phone without showing signs of wear.In order to address these issues, Samsung said in July that it had added additional reinforcements to the top and bottom of the hinge area, as well as extending a protective layer placed over the screen.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Though the government has ruled out even a technical extension during talks in Brussels, one option open to\u0026nbspthe opposition is to use legislation to force the prime minister to ask for a delay.\u0026nbspSo how likely would EU leaders be to grant an extension?\u0026nbspThis is uncertain: it can only be decided by the EU’s 27 remaining leaders. The last time Article 50 was extended to set the current deadline, the debate went well into the night and leaders had different views.But we do have a few clues...Boris Johnson’s chief Brexit negotiator heads to Brussels for talksJeremy Corbyn and other opposition leaders agree no-deal planTwo in five remainers ‘would be upset if child married leave voter’Last time, EU officials said the bloc would only agree to provide time for an extension for the UK to hold a general election, to hold a second referendum, or for a political process to work out a position that parliament could accept.It was the last of these options –\u0026nbspwhich came in the form of the indicative votes in parliament –\u0026nbspthat appeared to carry the day. These were ultimately inconclusive.Would EU leaders grant one again? Probably not for a similarly nebulous political process.\u0026nbspLeo Varadkar, Ireland’s prime minister, since said that he would support an extension for either a referendum or general election. That’s a narrowing of the three options presented last time.“There’s very much a strong view across the European Union that there shouldn’t be any more extensions. While I have endless patience, some of my colleagues, quite frankly, have lost patience with the UK – and there’s enormous hostility to any further extension,” Mr Varadkar told reporters on the doorstep of a summit in June.“So I think an extension could really only happen if it were to facilitate something like a general election in the UK, or even something like a second referendum, if they decided to have one. What won’t be entertained is an extension for further negotiations or further indicative votes. The time for that has long since passed.”Mr Varadkar is one of the most pro-extension leaders. Perhaps he’s bluffing, but it certainly seems unlikely that EU leaders would refuse to give the UK more time to carry out either of those things.But one problem is that the opposition MPs who want to stop a no deal with legislation –\u0026nbsprather than a vote of no confidence to bring down the government –\u0026nbspwould not necessarily be triggering an election.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Emmanuel Macron last time argued strongly against a long extension and officials said that while most leaders supported one at the time, next time things might be a little bit different. Varadkar of course\u0026nbspsaid EU leaders are losing patience with the UK – and that was months ago.In summary, an extension would be granted merely to avoid no deal would be far from certain. There is an undeniably correct recognition in some EU capitals that this simply kicks the can down the road. If that bid to stop no deal came with an election or referendum, however, they would be more likely to approve a further delay.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The storm was then expected to continue towards South Carolina by early Thursday, where Governor Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency on Saturday.\u0026nbspEvacuations began on Saturday in the Bahamas as most resorts closed down and authorities evacuated the northern shore and low-lying islands.The risk of storm surge and strong winds will increase by the middle of next week along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts, the National Hurricane Centre said.The centre also said that did not mean Dorian, packing 145 mph (230 kph) winds, won’t hit Florida, with large portions of the state in its cone of uncertainty forecast.\u0026nbspStill, after days of a forecast that put the Sunshine State and Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in the centre of expected landfalls, the changes are significant.Created with Sketch.Tropical storm Dorian expected to strengthen to hurricane Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Shoppers preparing for the arrival of tropical storm Dorian stock up on supplies at a supermarket in Bridgetown, Barbados, on 25 August 2019.Residents board up a pharmacy in Bridgetown, Barbados, 26 August 2019.Storm clouds gather as tropical storm Dorian moves towards St Michael Parish, Barbados, 26 August 2019.Nearly empty shelves where bottled water is normally displayed at a supermarket in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, 26 August 2019.Hotel employees remove sun loungers from a pool area in Gros Islet, St Lucia, 26 August 2019.Empty shelves that are normally filled with bread are seen empty at a supermarket in Gros Islet, St Lucia, 26 August 2019.Tropical storm Dorian is pictured off the coast of Venezuela in this NASA satellite photo, 26 August 2019.Shoppers preparing for the arrival of tropical storm Dorian stock up on supplies at a supermarket in Bridgetown, Barbados, on 25 August 2019.Residents board up a pharmacy in Bridgetown, Barbados, 26 August 2019.Storm clouds gather as tropical storm Dorian moves towards St Michael Parish, Barbados, 26 August 2019.Nearly empty shelves where bottled water is normally displayed at a supermarket in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, 26 August 2019.Hotel employees remove sun loungers from a pool area in Gros Islet, St Lucia, 26 August 2019.Empty shelves that are normally filled with bread are seen empty at a supermarket in Gros Islet, St Lucia, 26 August 2019.Tropical storm Dorian is pictured off the coast of Venezuela in this NASA satellite photo, 26 August 2019.“It’s going to be pretty scary because you’re going to have this gigantic hurricane sitting off the coast of Florida and it’s not going to move,” said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, but with the storm slowing and likely to turn north he adds: “The worst effects of a direct landfall are not in the forecast.”“At this point the track the hurricane centre\u0026nbspis issuing is not the catastrophe that could happen, which is good,” Mr Maue said on Saturday.But\u0026nbspthe Bahamas may be less fortunate.

He told reporters that “Mar-a-Lago can handle itself” and that he was more worried about Florida generally.As Dorian closed in, Labour Day weekend plans were upended nationwide.

Burr, who was white, served as America’s third vice president, but is best known for shooting dead founding father Alexander Hamilton in an 1804 duel, an episode memorialised in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s astonishingly successful musical.On a sunny day last weekend, 215 years after her ancestor killed Hamilton, and 12 months after the Aaron Burr Society formally acknowledged Burr had fathered two children with a woman of colour who worked as his servant, she\u0026nbspwas among 60 people who gathered in Philadelphia to unveil a headstone for John Pierre Burr – one of at least two children the vice president fathered outside of his marriage.“It was a beautiful day,” says Burr, professor of law at the University of New Mexico and author of Complicated Lives: Free Blacks in Virginia, 1619-1865.“We had a pastor who blessed the headstone. I was happy, because John Pierre was a champion for justice and the underground railroad.”Created with Sketch.Modern Slavery in the UK Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.NCA has launched a touring photographic exhibition which aims to portray the signs of slavery and exploitation. Entitled ‘Invisible People’, the exhibition will tour the country as part of the National Crime Agency’s campaign to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking.Child trafficking for sexual exploitationSome workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.Polish or Slovakian men are brought to the UK with the offer of employment and, after arrival, gangmasters seize documents, opening multiple bank and utility accounts in their names – butLabour-intensive sectors like construction, where temporary and irregular work are common, are high-risk sectors for forced labour. With new homes, offices and buildings being constructed or upgraded in great quantity, labour exploitation is the second most common type of modern slavery, after sexual exploitation.In the tough maritime industry young men, often Filipino or Indian, Eastern European or African, are promised a better life, but instead find themselves in a cycle of debt and exploitation.Each year, women from across Eastern Europe and West Africa are lured to the UK by the dream of a better life. Whether by fake migration services or unscrupulous iniduals who befriend and then betray them, women fall into a dark spiral of sexual exploitation and forced, unpaid prostitution, unable to escape.The cannabis industry hides a dark secret in the house next door. Gangs bring young boys to the UK from countries like Vietnam and deliver them to a house where, once in, they won’t be able to leave. Forced to tend cannabis plants that fill specially rigged houses, the boys are often locked in and forced to work, sleep and eat in one confined and dirty room. The chemicals used on the cannabis are poisonous, and often victims don’t know where they are or how to get help if they do escape.

Entitled ‘Invisible People’, the exhibition will tour the country as part of the National Crime Agency’s campaign to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking.Child trafficking for sexual exploitationSome workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.Polish or Slovakian men are brought to the UK with the offer of employment and, after arrival, gangmasters seize documents, opening multiple bank and utility accounts in their names – butLabour-intensive sectors like construction, where temporary and irregular work are common, are high-risk sectors for forced labour. With new homes, offices and buildings being constructed or upgraded in great quantity, labour exploitation is the second most common type of modern slavery, after sexual exploitation.In the tough maritime industry young men, often Filipino or Indian, Eastern European or African, are promised a better life, but instead find themselves in a cycle of debt and exploitation.Each year, women from across Eastern Europe and West Africa are lured to the UK by the dream of a better life. Whether by fake migration services or unscrupulous iniduals who befriend and then betray them, women fall into a dark spiral of sexual exploitation and forced, unpaid prostitution, unable to escape.The cannabis industry hides a dark secret in the house next door. Gangs bring young boys to the UK from countries like Vietnam and deliver them to a house where, once in, they won’t be able to leave. Forced to tend cannabis plants that fill specially rigged houses, the boys are often locked in and forced to work, sleep and eat in one confined and dirty room. The chemicals used on the cannabis are poisonous, and often victims don’t know where they are or how to get help if they do escape.

When Kamala Harris, an African American senator from California who is seeking the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, cautiously voiced support for studying whether there ought to be reparations for slavery – “We had more than 200 years of slavery. We had Jim Crow for almost a century. We had legalised discrimination, segregation. We have to recognise that everybody did not start out on an equal footing” – she faced a major backlash.These conversations come at a fraught time for the nation. Donald Trump may\u0026nbspor may not be\u0026nbspmore racist than\u0026nbspsome of those who preceded him in the Oval Office, but he is more prepared to use racist language openly. The imprimatur of those words as commander-in-chief, allied to the massive power of social media, has emboldened many who share his views, but who may not previously have voiced then aloud.“In the past we had coded language. Now it is more direct,” says Cassandra Newby-Alexander, professor of history at Norfolk State University, located 50 miles from Jamestown, where the English warship White Lion unloaded its human cargo. “There is a step-by-step process to embolden this racism, but I think it may only work for one-third of people. There are more white people unhappy with this level of hate speech.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two hundred years of slavery was followed by the Civil War, an event that somehow inspired twisted racists such as the Charleston church killer Dylann Roof the intentional failure of reform during Reconstruction, and then the system of Jim Crow, in which black people were returned to being second-class citizens, lynched, murdered, refused the right to live in certain areas and even to vote.\u0026nbspToday, efforts to suppress the voting rights of minorities persist with vigour in states such as Georgia, while the criminal justice system is utterly discriminatory against people of colour. Three years ago, when the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) announced plans to establish a museum to lynching victims, it estimated at least 4,000 African Americans were summarily murdered – their killings frequently watched by large crowds – between between 1877 and 1950.\u0026nbspWreckage of last ship used to bring slaves to America found in Alabama“It is hard history, and it’s particularly hard for Americans because it runs counter to the narrative we tell about ourselves – you know, freedom and justice for all,” says Swarns, whose work includes American Tapestry: The Story of the Black, White, and Multiracial Ancestors of Michelle Obama.“I think it is much easier to think about slavery as something that is very disconnected from us – long time ago, history book-slow, nothing to do with me today. We’re often known for not being big at looking in the rear view mirror.”She adds: “Coming to an understanding that slavery was as foundational as it was for a country that expounds these ideals\u0026nbspis profoundly difficult. That is on a macro level. At a personal level, I think it is just difficult for people.”Among Swarns’ revelations was that the founders of Georgetown University in Washington DC, which was established by Jesuits, owned slaves. Her 2017 report triggered reflection by a number of US universities where slavery had contributed to their wealth, as well as half-a-dozen in Britain, among them the universities of Oxford, Glasgow, Bristol and East London.Earlier this year, students at Georgetown voted to pay additional tuition fees to help establish a fund to benefit\u0026nbspthe descendants of the 272 slaves who were sold in 1838 to pay off the institution’s debts.Swarns, a contributing writer for the New York Times and associate professor of journalism at New York University, says such gestures give her hope, just as incidents such as the 2017 neo-Nazi march at Charlottesville, make her despair. She says this dichotomy, the shifting back and forth of progress, is also part of America’s story.Carol Anderson, professor of African American Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, has written about the backlash triggered among some white Americans following the election of Barack Obama, the country’s first and only African American president. The reemergence of Tea Party activists, and congressional obstruction, was part a pattern dating to the Civil War and the passage of the 13th Amendment that officially\u0026nbspended slavery.Each time African Americans have made advances, she says in her book White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, white reaction has resulted in a deliberate roll back. The end of the Civil War and Reconstruction was greeted with the Jim Crow era, the Supreme Court’s Brown v Board of Education decision resulted in the shutting down of schools in the South, while the bloody opposition to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 led to a new, coded response – the so-called Southern Strategy and the “war on drugs”, that took the vote from millions of black people, while helping project Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan into the White House.Anderson tells The Independent the US is currently ided between those states wanting to expand access to the ballot box and make the electorate more inclusive, and those seeking to restrict access, in order to reduce the number of minority voters.Why won’t the UK even talk about reparations for slavery?Cory Booker gets 12 co-sponsors on slavery reparations billModern slavery victims ‘sent back to addresses where they were abused’Cambridge slavery inquiry will show we have plenty to feel guilty forSome Americans believe the events of 1619 should not be memorialised at all. When the New York Times magazine announced it was dedicating an issue to mark the arrival of the the first enslaved Africans and what that presaged, a number accused the newspaper of stoking racial tensions.Newt Gringrich, a former Republican speaker of the House and a close ally of Trump, tweeted: “The New York Times 1619 Project should make its slogan ‘All the propaganda we want to brainwash you with’.”Burr, the writer and academic from New Mexico who discovered her link to America’s third vice president, says the opposite. In her words, Americans cannot talk enough what happened, both then and now.“The reason people don’t want to talk about slavery is that they don’t want to dig up the past. They don’t want to take responsibility,” she says.\u0026nbsp“All aspects of what happened to those original Africans, and what happened afterwards, should be discovered and analysed. Not enough people can be told about the 400th anniversary, not enough speeches can happen.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

But, the\u0026nbspsad truth is there\u0027s become an over-reliance on using pre-existing material to either find the\u0026nbspnext big franchise or to capitalise on the success of a bestseller. It\u0027s fair enough – these\u0026nbspadaptations will always be guaranteed large box office takings thanks to the book\u0027s readers\u0026nbspmerely\u0026nbspshowing up\u0026nbspto see\u0026nbsphow the film has translated certain parts to the screen.While there are solid examples of successful big-screen adaptations – The Lord of the Rings,\u0026nbspstray\u0026nbspHarry Potter films, Gone Girl – there have more than likely been a larger number of botch jobs. Nothing is more disappointing than seeing a film version of your favourite book and realising minutes\u0026nbspin that the director\u0026nbsphas misjudged the novel\u0027s spirit or two actors have been cast in the wrong roles and\u0026nbsphave no chemistry whatsoever.This week sees the release of A Million Little Pieces, an addiction drama from Sam Taylor-Wood that follows\u0026nbspan alcoholic and drug abuser\u0027s rehabilitation. Aaron\u0026nbspTaylor-Johnson plays the lead role. it\u0027s based on the semi-fictional book\u0026nbspby James Frey – the author who originally presented the novel as a memoir before it was later\u0026nbsprevealed many of\u0026nbspits events hadn\u0027t happened. The film\u0027s reviews have been middling, with many questioning why the book was adapted in the first place. Maybe these writers should merely take inspiration\u0026nbspand create their own original stories?Below, we rank the 25 books that should have been left alone and never made into films. Click through the gallery to see what made the list.Created with Sketch.25 books that should have never been made into films Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone. The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s with us the people – and that’s why we need to take action.Our message to Johnson is this:you steal our democracy, well shut down the streets.But Tories reacted with fury to Momentums ludicrous plan.David TC Davies told The Sun: Momentum seem to think that no one should do anything without their permission - and theyre going to block the streetsthey dont get their way.And its ironic that they are complaining about Parliament being shut down while they are stopping anyone from getting there at all.Another MP added: “They appear to be trying to ‘Stop the Coup’ as they put it by launching one of their own.”A former Labour MP – Tom Blenkinsop – tweeted that Momentum was “playing into the hands of the right” with their fury.It comes after thousands of people turned up to protest outside Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament last night.Spontaneous protests are being planned in Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield too.Earlier today Mr Rees-Mogg urged teeth-gnashing Remainers to change the law or boot the Government out -they can.The Commons leader led the Government fightback today against pro-EU MPs who have vowed to stop Boris Johnson shutting down Parliament next month.Mr Rees-Mogg told them to bring it on - and that the Government was ready.He told the BBC this morning: All these people who are wailing and gnashing of teeth know that there are two ways of doing what they want to do.One, is to change the government and the other is to change the law. If they do either of those, that will then have an effect.If they dont have either the courage or the gumption to do either of those then we will leave on the st of October in accordance with the referendum result.And he added: No party should be afraid of the British people.If they have a vote of confidence, lets seethey can win it.He said the outrage over shutting down Parliament was phoney and blasted Speaker Bercow for his insistent.The teasing came as he said that Mr Corbyn doesnt have enough mates to win such a vote.Nobody wants him to be PM, he joked, labelling those who are trying to thwart Brexit as spewing out phoney outrage because they want to stop us from leaving.They are trying very hard to overturn the referendum result, he blasted.Labours Barry Gardiner confirmed to Sky News today that Labour would apply for an emergency debate next week, and would seek to force Boris to get another Brexit extension.Yesterday Boris asked the Queen for her approval to suspend proceedings for nearly five weeks from as early as September  - and she accepted.Under the extraordinary move, the PM will be able to suspend Parliament no earlier than Monday, September  and no later than Thursday, September ."},{"url":null,"title":"prince andrew must not duck epstein questions","story":"While the rest of the Royal Family go out of their way to be polite and pleasant to us mere peasants, he appeared to take great joy in making me feel uncomfortable. Well, now it’s his turn to squirm.I have no idea of his exact involvement with the hideous pervert Jeffrey Epstein during their “friendship”, but this week one of Epstein’s alleged victims claimed she had sex with Andrew three times. Virginia Roberts, photographed being embraced by the prince when she was a teenager, claimed he “knows exactly what he has done” and should “come clean” about it.The waters are being muddied with claims by “friends” of Andrew the photo is fake. He strenuously denies any wrongdoing but this story is not going to go away and people are demanding answers.Epstein hanged himself in his New York jail cell this month while on sex-trafficking charges — and sparked conspiracy theories galore.Andrew claims he knew nothing about Epstein’s disgusting lestyle, but it is baffling that he continued to associate with him even after Epstein’s conviction in  for procuring an underage girl for prostitution, making him a registered sex offender.Why on Earth would anyone continue to hang out with such an unsavoury character, especially , like Andrew, you are a dad with two daughters of your own  At the very least this scandal shows that Andrew has appalling judgment when it comes to his pals and associates.He has previous when it comes to cosying up to the rich and dubious. Questions were asked when Andrew sold his run-down “Southyork” mansion to a Kazakh oligarch in  for millions over the asking price.MOST READ IN OPINION\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Ian-Duncan.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentIAIN DUNCAN SMITH Corbyns hate mob are the ones staging a coup with anti-Brexit marches \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN ON SUNDAY SAYS Emmanuel Macron is now bending as European fears about No Deal grow \" data-srcset\"https:i.wp www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-.jpg croppx%Cpx%Cpx%Cpxresize%Cssl\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN SAYS Jeremy Corbyn and panic-stricken Remainers are now resorting to blatant lies \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Tony-Parson-.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTONY PARSONS Boris Johnsons brightness is a welcome sight after three years of gloom \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-james-forsyth.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentJAMES FORSYTH Its rogue ones vs. prorogue ones as MPs fight to seize control of Brexit \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Karen-Brady.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" KARREN BRADY Real friends, not screen friends, are the key to keeping your kids happy Again, he denied any wrongdoing and the scandal went away. That might not be the case this time around. He’s very lucky that the Queen continues to stand by him. Andrew is always cited as her favourite child and Her Majesty accepts her son’s vehement denials when it comes to Epstein.He also has the full support of ex-we Sarah Ferguson, who knows all too well what it is like to be caught up in a scandal. She was apparently financially “assisted” by Epstein, something she now regrets.Sarah and Andrew have been lying low on holiday together, sparking rumours they are back together. But even this odd couple realised Andrew playing his usual rounds of golf in the Spanish sunshine looked callous.They are back for “crisis talks” and I don’t envy the royal advisers who have to try to spin this one. No one is saying Andrew has committed any sort of crime, but anything that has Epstein’s grubby fingerprints all over it inevitably reeks to high heaven.And the Prince has done his reputation irreparable harm by his association with such a contemptible sexual predator. We are light years away from the dashing young prince who won the respect and admiration of the British public for his role in the Falklands War.He has never reached the heady heights of that level of popularity since, and clearly he never will again. But he could redeem himself by at least being willing to answer questions from investigators in the States.Being a royal should not mean he is above helping law enforcement. It might be embarrassing and uncomfortable — butAndrew has done nothing wrong, he has nothing to worry about.NEVER mind the nights drawing in, you know our summer days are numbered when Strictly rears its sequinned head. This year has the potential to be a classic.I always look forward to seeing the celebs step into the spray tan booth, embrace the glitz and rhinestones and unleash their inner as. But my ones-to-watch this year have actually already found theirs.Michelle Visage from Ru Paul’s Drag Race and ex-Corrie star Catherine Tyldesley both have big personalities, raucous laughs and are women after my own heart.Michelle has been very open about her struggles with an eating disorder, and recently had her breast implants removed due to health concerns. She’s a fierce campaigner for more understanding about the side-effects of breast enhancement ops.Catherine has always wanted to be a dancer but said this week that being overweight as a youngster scuppered her chances of tripping the light fantastic.She famously lost st and promotes sensible eating and exercise as the only way to shed weight, which is something I’ve been banging on about forever. Both are at the top of their game and raring to go.They will burn up the dancefloor and provide us with some memorable moments . . .  but as they are both happily married, these will all thankfully be Strictly confined to the ballroom floor.WHAT in the name of Rule Britannia is going on with British Airways  They are lurching from crisis to crisis, with computer glitches and strikes almost becoming the norm.Last week I had to cancel a long-awaited trip to Orkney because of the proposed industrial action next month by BA pilots, after receiving an email to say my flight had been axed. With a heavy heart, I apologetically cancelled the glorious Foveran Hotel, our car hire and the babysitter for our dog son Angus.The next day another computer-generated email popped up telling me that actually the flight wasn’t cancelled after all. Oops, and all that. Now I’ve been trying to get some clarity from the BA hotline for days – with no joy.I’m reluctant to rebook everything in case it all goes t*ts-up again and they cancel the flights for a second time. It’s infuriating, stressful and upsetting. Behind every cancelled or delayed flight are heartbreaking stories of people missing weddings, hospital visits, funerals and job interviews.Can I stress emphatically that, in my experience, BA staff at the check-in coal face, who have to deal with distraught and angry passengers when flights are cancelled or delayed, deserve a blinking medal for their patience and forbearance in dealing with the recent avalanche of almighty management cock-ups.Likewise, those battling valiantly in customer service, and all of the stalwart cabin crew, especially those with years of experience who are unfailingly professional, caring and kind.They are being as badly let down as us passengers, and it’s depressing to see a once proud and noble British brand shooting itself in the foot.Those at the very top really don’t deserve their hardworking staff and they also have to stop taking us customers for granted.NORMALLY I view those “scientic studies” about the benefits or detriments of certain food and drink with folded arms and a very sceptical: “Aye, right.”It might, however, be worth paying attention to the very latest one which concludes that red wine really is good for you.We already knew about the benefits for your heart, but now it turns out red wine could improve digestion and protect you against issues with high cholesterol.I reckon the men and women in white lab coats have a point.Cheers!I’VE been lucky enough to have spent the past couple of weeks travelling around Rajasthan in India.I happily scoffed some form of curry three times a day for every meal and guzzled very impressive Indian wine.I’m now addicted to dosa with daal and spicy mint sauce for breakfast – followed throughout the day by chilli paneer and laal maas all washed down with endless cups of masala tea.Halfway through the trip, I rather naively posted a snap of myself, right, taken by the pool during our stay in Shahpura Bagh, on the way to Jodhpur. It showed that my excess holiday baggage had mainly landed around my tummy.Some people were very kind about my -year-old unfiltered, non- Photoshopped body, my make-up-free face and flyaway hair. Others not so much.All I wanted to do was show that you don’t have to be body perfect to wear a bikini and smile in the sunshine when you are on holiday.We shouldn’t feel embarrassed about a few lumps and bumps or scars and blemishes and we need to stop beating ourselves up all the time and learn to celebrate our so-called flaws. Le really is too short.SHAME on all of those chortling at little Prince George because he is taking ballet lessons. I’m sure none of the mockers have ever actually met a male ballet dancer.Those fellas are as tough as nails.They can beat a bully into a pulp with one flick of their sinewy wrists. They are mentally and physically fiercely strong.I can’t think of a better way for the future king to learn discipline, teamwork and how to push himself to the limit.

With the connivance of the Speaker John Bercow, they will almost certainly succeed.Having gained this power, they will set about binding Boris Johnson’s hands. They will try to legislate to ensure this country cannot leave the European Union without a deal.Do they have the numbers to pull this off  Probably, yes.The ranks of Tory rebels have been swelled by the arrival of former Cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond and David Gauke, and the Government’s decision to prorogue Parliament means that plans to wait until the end of September to act have been dropped.One former minister says the “prorogation scandal has tipped things over the edge”.If they have the numbers, do they have the time  This is more doubtful.No’s decision to prorogue Parliament means they would have to get a bill through both Houses in just over a week. With Bercow’s help, it will be possible for them to rush it through the Commons quickly. But it will be much harder to do that in the Lords.One Brexit-backing former Secretary of State tells me: “Our lot down there will do their best to talk it out.”Eventhe rebels can get a bill passed, the Government’s actions this week are designed to show that they won’t simply comply with it. They want the rebels to think they can’t succeed unless they change the government. “The aim is to force a binary choice between Corbyn and our Brexit plan,” is how one of those at the heart of things explains it.Those close to Boris Johnson believe this is their best chance of getting things through. They calculate that, ultimately, the Commons will not be prepared to take the risk of making Jeremy Corbyn prime minister.This is a high-risk manoeuvre. But so far, the thought of putting Corbyn in No even temporarily has proved too much for all but a couple of the Tory rebels.At the same time, Boris is trying to reassure Tory MPs that he really is trying for a deal. I understand that next week, Amber Rudd — the Work and Pensions Secretary who campaigned for Remain in  — will join with him as part of an effort to persuade Tory MPs not to back the rebel legislation, and to give him time to secure a deal.I am told she was “disappointed” by his decision to prorogue but remains convinced he is genuine about getting a deal and that the EU will offer concessionsParliament backs the Government next week.The biggest problem with the extension the rebels want is they can’t say what it is for. The reason is they can’t agree on what its purpose should be: Many want to stop Brexit altogether, others just to block No Deal.An extension without a purpose would do nothing but prolong the uncertainty and keep this country in limbo. It is time to get on with it.Why, because No think most voters just want Brexit done, so they want to be talking about the public’s priorities.They think they win whenever Boris is seen on the news discussing these issues. The polls suggest the PM is having some success with this approach. One Secretary of State puts the current Tory poll lead down to BoJo being: “Very effective at giving them hope of a non-Brexit dominated world.”Of course, another reason why the PM wants to keep hammering home his domestic priorities is that we are going to end up having a general election in the next few months.l IN another sign that a general election is coming, I am informed that the Scottish Tories will not select their new leader until AFTER such a poll.The decision to stick with an interim leader following Ruth Davidson’s resignation suggests the  hierarchy north of the border doesn’t think there is  time to have a proper leadership contest before any general election.We will clearly all be heading to the polling station sooner, rather than later.ANY Tory MP who votes for the extension legislation next week will not be allowed to stand as a Tory candidate at the next election.I understand No have decided to treat next week’s votes as they would a confidence vote, with anyone not backing the Government being immediately disqualied from standing for the party again. They hope this will keep some Tory waverers in the Government lobby next week.It would mean thatformer Cabinet ministers such as Philip Hammond voted for the legislation, as they intend to, they would be barred from standing for the party again, ending their time as Tory MPs.  It is hard to think of a precedent for so many Tories going from being Cabinet ministers to being ineligible to stand for the party.This upping of the stakes will certainly have an effect on some Tory MPs. There will be those who are reluctant to end their careers in the party over this issue.This approach is not without risk, though. There is a danger  MPs will still rebel  then decide  they have nothing left to lose, increasing not only the chances of them voting down the Government in a no-confidence vote, but also backing an alternative prime minister.Currently, only about ten per cent of Home Office grants to charities go to those with an income of less than £million a year, compared to the sixty-odd per cent which goes to those with an income of £million plus a year.The new Home Secretary, Priti Patel, has been impressed by the efforts of charities such as OnSide, which work to keep kids off the street.One ally of the Home Secretary says that more police and greater stop and search powers are, “only one side of the coin”,  in terms of dealing with kne crime and that “there are lots of kids with nothing to do and that’s a big reason so many are falling in with the wrong crowd and getting into trouble.“There are some great small charities out there giving them a purpose beyond a le of crime, and they deserve more support.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The trend is somewhat favourable — though the danger is still high along the immediate coastline.”The devastation caused by Dorian could be made worse by exceptionally strong tides called King Tide -which makes coastal areas more vulnerable to flooding.The super-strength tide happens around the time as a full moon or new moon and this year the King Tides have already flooded neighbourhoods in Miami - and the most recent full moon was yesterday.The storms winds reached mph today - just mph shy of becoming a Category  hurricane.Winds are currently raging over the warm Atlantic waters and is inching towards the northwestern Bahamas, according to the US National Hurricane Center.The centre says the storms path is still unpredictable, but Georgia and the Carolinas are now at risk of strong winds and le-threatening storm surge.The hurricane has slowed down since Thursday as it was originally expected to make landfall by Sunday.The NHC still warned Florida residents to say on alert.They said: It should be noted that the new forecast track does not preclude Dorian making landfall on the Florida coast, as large portions of the coast remain in the track cone of uncertainty.Supermarket shelves have been left bare as residents scramble to prepare for the Category  storm.Floridians left supermarket shelves empty after grabbing water, bread and canned goods in the event power and water are cut off.At a Publix supermarket in Cocoa Beach, Ed Ciecirski of the customer service department said the pharmacy was extra busy with people rushing to fill prescriptions.The grocery was rationing bottled water and had run out of dry ice.Homeowners and businesses rushed to cover their windows with plywood.Tfany Miranda of Miami Springs, Florida said: I feel helpless because the whole coast is threatened.What’s the use of going all the way to Georgiait can land there You never know with these hurricanes. It could be good, it could be bad. You just have to be prepared.Jeremy Kichler, a University of Georgia extension agent in Colquitt County who works with local farmers, told local news: A lot of folks are still recovering from Irma two years ago and Michael last year.I don’t knowwe can stand another one.Ron DeSantis, the governor, said the Florida Highway Patrol would begin escorting fuel trucks to help them get past the lines of waiting motorists and replenish gas stations.On Friday, the National Hurricane Center said Dorian had just reached extremely dangerous Category  status with winds already clocking  mph .The first mandatory evacuation orders were carried out this morning.Residents in Bred County have been told to start leaving at am on Sunday The Weather Channel reports.Coastal areas could get  to  inchesof rain, with  inchesin some places, triggering le-threatening flash floods, the hurricane center said.FEMA official Jeff Byard said Dorian is likely to create a lot of havoc for roads, power and other infrastructure.Sunday: Dorians hurricane siege will begin in the northwest Bahamas as it continues to slow down. Tropical storm-force winds may begin to arrive in parts of Florida. Large swells should begin to arrive at the coast from North Carolina to Florida.Monday: Dorian may still be hammering the northwest Bahamas as it crawls slowly. Bands of rain, strong winds may affect parts of Florida. How strong the winds will be depends on how close the center of Dorian is to the Florida coast, which is uncertain at this time.Tuesday-Thursday: Dorian is expected to move north, then northeast near the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. The exact track is very uncertain, ranging from a track far enough offshore to keep hurricane force winds away from land, to a landfall anywhere in this zone.Friday-Next Saturday: Dorian is then expected to race off the Northeast Seaboard, but could track close enough to bring rain and some wind to the Virginia Tidewater, Nantucket, Marthas Vineyard and Cape Cod, before it heads toward the Canadian Maritimes by next weekend.The US President said his prized Mar-a-Lago estate is in the path of the potentially deadly storm, which is expected to be extremely destructive.When asked how concerned he was about the hurricane threat to his resort, Trump said: “It would look like Mar-a-Lago is dead center but look Mar-a-Lago can handle itself.“Thats a very powerful place.He added: The thing Im worried about is the state of Florida because ... this could be a record-setting hurricane.“Now maybe things change. Were hoping for one element that might happen and thats that it makes a right turn and goes up north just prior to or equal to hitting shore.“That would be great, but thats a pretty small percentage at this point.Hurricanes have always been a part of Mar-a-Lago.In , Trump said he received a  million insurance payment for hurricane damage to the resort.Disney World is also on alert as Hurricane Dorian barrels across the Atlantic Ocean towards Florida.A spokesman said the Orlando resort is “operating under normal conditions” but they are “closely monitoring the path of the projected weather”.The resort has cancelled weekend sporting events and closing Disney’s Blizzard Beach Water Park on Sunday.They are also contacting guests with current and upcoming reservations at a number of campgrounds, cabins and villas.Jessica Armesto and her one-year-old daughter, Mila, had planned to have breakfast with Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy at Disney World.Instead, Armesto decided to take shelter at her mothers hurricane-resistant house in Miami with its kitchen full of non-perishable foods.It felt like it was better to be safe than sorry, so we cancelled our plans, she said.As Dorian closed in, the storm upended peoples Labor Day weekend plans.Major airlines began allowing travellers to change their reservations without a fee.The big cruise lines began rerouting their ships.The Bahamas is also under threat, with canned food and bottled water disappearing quickly and the sound of hammering echoed across the islands as people boarded up their homes.Dorian was expected to hit by Sunday with the potential for le-threatening storm surge that could raise water levels  feet above normal.Do not be foolish and try to brave out this hurricane, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said.The price you may pay for not evacuating is your le.In Florida, the governor urged nursing homes to take precautions to prevent tragedies like the one during Hurricane Irma two years ago.That storm knocked out the air conditioning at a facility in Hollywood and  patients died in the sweltering heat.Four employees of the home were charged with manslaughter earlier this week.DeSantis said the timely message from those arrests is: Its your responsibility to make sure you have a plan in place to protect those folks.At NASAs Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, NASA moved a -foot-high mobile launch  to the safety of the colossal Vehicle Assembly Building, built to withstand  mphwind.The launcher is for the mega rocket that NASA is developing to take astronauts to the moon.The hurricane season typically peaks between mid-August and late October.One of the most powerful storms ever to hit the US was on Labor Day in ."},{"url":null,"title":"viking sun ship london worlds longest cruise 245 days","story":"The Viking Sun ship is docked on the River Thames in Greenwich and will embark on the longest passenger sea crossing in history this weekend, spanning six continents,  countries and  ports.Over eight months, the voyage from London will aim to set a Guinness world record for the longest continuous passenger cruise.With stops including the southern-most tip of South America to the vibrant Indian city of Mumbai, it is sure to tick off plenty of bucket-list adventures.And  passengers,  including four from the UK, have reportedly signed up for the full  days.The voyagers can expect toto London on May  of .But circumnavigating the globe on board the -guest cruise liner does not come cheap -

Russian Defence Ministry shows a Iskander missile being fired from a mobile launchpad buried in an anti-blast trench. The K Iklander, which can be fitted with thermonuclear warheads, was fired from a secret rocket launch and development facility near the Caspian Sea. Its mobile launch was in a prepared trench at the Kapustin Bar site in Astrakhan region.Aerial footage from an Orlan- military drone showed the RTRK Iskander hitting its target with a conventional warhead in what Moscow bragged was a successful strike. The missile was fired at a mock “critically important target belonging to the simulated enemy”.Iklanders are deployed in Kaliningrad, a Russian Baltic Sea enclave, the closest point of the Kremlin empire to Britain.But the maximum range of  miles is not enough to reach London and would more likely be launched at targets in Eastern and Central Europe. On Friday the Kremlin released a video of the test showing a Kalibr missile blasting into the air and then blowing a target resembling a ship to smithereens.The tests come after Putin vowed to  “react accordingly” after the United States carried out a missile test on August , which would have been banned under a

around , — report being unhappy with their lives as a whole, according to The Children’s Society.This is partly due to increasing loneliness and turbulent friendships. And guess what has been highlighted by charity experts as the main cause “Excessive social media use.”Anyone surprised by that either  Thought not.Of course, not all children are unhappy. But parents should take this news as a serious warning shot. Because when it comes to our children’s happiness, the trend is clearly going in the wrong direction.With social media, the problem is partly one of expectations.Most grown-ups are seasoned enough to take the inevitable “my perfect le” posts on Instagram with a pinch of salt.MOST READ IN OPINION\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Ian-Duncan.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentIAIN DUNCAN SMITH Corbyns hate mob are the ones staging a coup with anti-Brexit marches \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN ON SUNDAY SAYS Emmanuel Macron is now bending as European fears about No Deal grow \" data-srcset\"https:i.wp www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT-.jpg croppx%Cpx%Cpx%Cpxresize%Cssl\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN SAYS Jeremy Corbyn and panic-stricken Remainers are now resorting to blatant lies \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   TM-comp-Tony-Parson-.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTONY PARSONS Boris Johnsons brightness is a welcome sight after three years of gloom \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-james-forsyth.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentJAMES FORSYTH Its rogue ones vs. prorogue ones as MPs fight to seize control of Brexit Butyou are new to these things, being bombarded with images on your mate’s Instagram page of the le you are “meant” to be living could make even the most secure children begin to feel inadequate.The other problem is that it’s always “on” — and so are our kids. It used to be that children could shut the front door on a day of school and leave it on the outside until morning. Now, though, there is -hour access.Another news story this week revealed that nine out of ten teens aren’t getting enough sleep or exercise. It doesn’t take a genius to link the two issues.Social media — and reality TV — also reveal a new emphasis on appearance that has changed so much in the past  years, for adults as well as children. It’s just that children are more susceptible to that pressure.Other things have changed too — not least our approach to parenting . We are much more child-focused, which isn’t a bad thing necessarily.But telling our kids they are the best, no matter what they do, risks them thinking they are the best without doing anything at all to be so.Yes, we can help boost our children’s self-esteem. But what we should really do is help them boost their own self-esteem by doing things that make them feel good about themselves.Obviously, more families now have two parents in the workplace. That is a good thing but perhaps some working parents feel the need to compensate for their absence in ways — such as too many screens and “treats” — that aren’t necessarily brilliant for their children’s mental health.I write as a mother of two who worked more or less throughout my children’s young lives.I’m proud to say we all made it through in one piece.Obviously, I am no parenting expert. And I’m not claiming to have the answer to the world’s ills.But over the years, I’ve identied three golden rules I believe build a foundation for happy kids.The first is sport. I passionately believe that being part of a team, having regular exercise, being out and about and maintaining a routine offers kids stability and boundaries.It helps children feel good about their bodies and their abilities, boosting their self-esteem.The second is friendship. I am talking about proper friendship — not Facebook “friends” you never meet. When kids leave their phones at home and develop real friendships, they find people they can talk to and have fun with.Never underestimate the importance of fun. The third golden rule is probably the most important. Keep talking.There are too many tragic examples recently of young people who felt it necessary to take their own lives. I believe a problem shared is a problem halved. No matter how bad something is, talking always helps.I don’t remember ever reading about suicide when I was younger — especially not suicide in young people. Now it is the biggest cause of death among people aged  to  and it affects three times more men than women. That is a scary statistic.The causes are complicated but we need to keep channels of communication open with our kids. That way,they are unhappy, we will know about it. Andwe know about it, we at least have the potential to help.Remember Alfie Patten  For a while, in , he was known as the nation’s youngest father at the age of just .Then he found out, later that year, that it was another boy who had made his -year-old girlfriend pregnant. So Alfie was off the hook.That should have left him with the feeling that he had dodged a bullet.It could have spurred him on towards getting a good education and a job, to building himself a future.The adults in his le should have encouraged him to do just that.Instead, this week he turned up at Lewes Crown Court to be sentenced after being convicted of criminal damage.The court heard he is now a jobless alcoholic who lives at home with his mother and has a history of criminal offences.He already had a -month suspended prison sentence hanging over his head after being convicted on June  of shoplting, theft and possession of an imitation firearm.This is a good reminder that suspended sentences do not work. Alfie Patten clearly needs a bigger wake-up call than a suspended sentence or he risks ending up dead from alcohol and drugs.I saw a bench in my local park the other day that said: “Die with memories . . .  not dreams.”So true. But this guy, who is creating all the wrong sorts of memories, is a nightmare.Well, I don’t know about you but I am filled with relief that the heatwave – and even summer – is over.The cooler weather is perfect timing for going back to school and back to work, so we can all concentrate again.

Joan, is classy, funny and damn stylish. Or as my nan would’ve said, well turned out.Another day, another story about taxpayers’ money being wasted in foreign aid.This week it emerged that classrooms in nearly  schools in Pakistan – paid for by us – have been closed because they were badly built and unsafe.The buildings were erected as part of a £million aid project and their closure has left , children taking lessons outdoors or in overcrowded rooms.So, presumably, back where they were in the first place. On the upside, this has prompted some MPs to call for an inquiry about how our annual foreign aid budget – around £billion – is spent.On the downside, this is an example of yet more foreign aid money that has fallen into the wrong hands and ended up being wasted.In the meantime, British schools are crying out for investment.So why are we spending money on Pakistani schools and not our own Meanwhile, in the UK, overseas patients have left the NHS with more than £million in unpaid bills for treatment, it emerged this week. That cash could pay for , nurses, , heart bypasses or nearly , junior doctors.Two London hospitals are owed £million each, including almost £, from one patient alone.Apparently staff are reluctant to chase payments, with doctors’ leaders saying their obligation to charge overseas patients is “racist” and deters vulnerable groups from seeking help.To me, that sounds completely bonkers.I don’t understand why you are not asked to produce your NHS number – we all have one – when you get to hospital.Every other country asks, so why not us It’s a national service, not an international one.Former Big Brother contestant Kate Lawler is campaigning to remove the taboo facing women who don’t want children.She said she considers her two dogs, Baxter and Shirley, as her family and she’s very content with that.She’s right, of course. Whether or not you want children comes down to personal choice and it should be fine for women not to want them.The only problem with her situation, though, is that her fiancé is “desperate” for children, which doesn’t sound so good.I think the most important thing when choosing whether or not to have kids with someone is the pair of you both being on the same page. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You have helped raise nearly £, – enough to start treatment for tiny Theo Hutton, who was revived seven minutes after being stillborn. This month parents Laura and Andy will take the tot, who has cerebral palsy, to Panama for stem surgery. They hope it will be the first of five such treatments aimed at massively enhancing the quality of their happy -month-old son’s le. The couple want to raise £, for Theo. Laura, , said: “The fact that people we don’t know have seen the story and donated is just amazing.  “We can’t thank them enough. Now our focus is to keep going so we can take him back for a second course in seven or eight months time.” The pioneering stem cell surgery, not currently available on the NHS, has led to huge improvements in other children who suffer from the incurable and ­crippling condition. Theo’s brain was starved of oxygen in the course of the dficult birth and he is unable to sit, walk or talk. Laura and Andy were told Theo was a blue baby and he was immediately whisked away. They described it as every “parent’s worst nightmare”.  After they watched him being ­resuscitated the tot was placed on le-support, ­attached to numerous wires and tubes, while his parents were told he might not make it. Laura cried when she could finally hold Theo for the first time. He was five days old. After they finally took him home they soon realised he wasn’t developing at the same rate as other babies. At  months he was ­diagnosed with cerebral palsy – a condition which affects one in  UK tots. Laura said the treatment in Panama aims to stimulate stem cell growth in the brain.  She said: “He will have five stem cell treatments via IV drips. One a day for five days. We are hopeful that it will help him. Every small step for Theo is a massive step for us.” The procedure would see  ­millions stem cells from a donor umbilical cord injected into Theo’s system to stimulate and repair damaged nervous tissue in the brain. Laura and Andy, , hope to take him to the Stem Cell Institute in Panama City once a year for the next five years. Each course of treatment will cost about £, but the couple say it could improve the youngster’s le hugely, helping him achieve milestones they can only dream of at the moment. Laura, a health and safety manager from Wirral, Merseyside, said: “Around  per cent of your brain is ­developed by the time you are five so, hopefully, we can get the first three treatments in by then so they would have the most benefit.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy 5 who cant walk","story":"NewsBoy, , denied le-changing NHS therapy - even though he cant walk or talkEXCLUSIVE: Little Huzaah Zia has a chance of le but the NHS has ruled the treatment out as it is judged as being experimentalShareCommentsByNicola SmallAmy Sharpe:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsLittle Huzaah Zia just wants to live\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Huzaah Zia, five, is unable to walk, talk or, heartbreakingly, even hold a toy. His family are desperately trying to raise £, to fly him , miles to Poland for pioneering treatment. Huzaah is one of just six British children afflicted by the Parkinson’s-like condition and it is feared he will not live beyond his teens. He spends  hours a day on a feeding tube, needs  daily doses of medication and suffers  painful seizures a month. An NHS consultant at London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital recommended gene therapy for his illness, Amino Acid Decarboxylasedeficiency, which hampers the nervous system. But the NHS ruled it out on the grounds the treatment is judged as being “experimental”.    Mum Sehrish, , yesterday told the Sunday Mirror the decision had left the family shattered. She said: “It was devastating. They are denying him a childhood. With therapy there is the potential for him to live a normal le. Surely that is worth £,  If he had the therapy he would need fewer appointments, saving the NHS money long term.” Parents of four other children say their lives were transformed by the therapy, which involves implanting a missing enzyme into brain cells. It reportedly stopped seizures, while also improving motor and mental .    Sehrish, whose husband Shohaib, , works for fashion retailer Asos, is now plotting a trip from the family home in Luton, Beds, to Poland –an internet appeal can raise funds. She said: “At the moment he is stuck. Every day is a struggle. We were really optimistic the NHS would want to give our son this chance. “It wasn’t an idea we came up with ourselves – it was an application by a consultant who believes this could give our son the chance at a normal childhood. “With gene therapy we hope he would be able to sit, crawl and, one day, walk and talk. Seizures would disappear and he would slowly come off medication. He would still need occupational therapy and physio. “But there is potential for him to go to school and be a young boy and one day live a normal adult le.”  The couple, who have a nine-year-old daughter Safa and son Ayaan, eight, fear time is running out. They told how only  children worldwide have AADC – and eight died last year. Sehrish added: “Delaying this is putting Huzaah in danger. When we hear how other children have passed away suddenly we worry the same thing will happen to our son. He is vulnerable and can become poorly very quickly.” The parents feared for Huzaah from the day he was born. Sehrish said: “His eyes rolled in his head at one point and he struggled to breastfeed. At his six week check I was told he was healthy and happy – but I was not.” At six months he was unable to roll, sit upright, or crawl. He had a persistent infection in his mouth and slept up to  hours a day. After blood tests and a scan he was referred to Great Ormond Street for a lumbar puncture. And, at just seven months, he was diagnosed with AADC, which affects the way signals pass between cells in the nervous system. Sehrish added: “We were in bits, absolutely shattered. We were shown photos of children with the disease and noticed the same features as Huzaah – long nose, rounded cheeks, large mouth. We cried a lot. But my husband is a positive person, he said this was meant to happen and all we can do is give Huzaah the best le we can.”  The condition is likened to Parkinson’s due to stfness and involuntary movement. Other symptoms include vomiting, weak muscle tone and an inability to regulate body temperature. Tests revealed Shohaib carried the faulty gene. There is a one in four chance Safa and Ayaan also carry it and they will be tested when they are older. Adapting to Huzaah’s needs has been tough. Sehrish said: “He cannot hold any toys as he has no grip. He began having seizures where his eyes would roll back for up to  minutes and he’d lose where he is, getting worsehe was over-stimulated with noise. Only medication will stop it. I learned to lie in a dark room next to him while he calmed down then slept.” At night his exhausted parents take turns to stay awake to tend to his feeding tube and prevent him from chokinghe vomits. The couple joined the worldwide AADC Research Trust and attended conferences to hear expert speakers including Dr Manju Kurian, consultant at Great Ormond Street. Three years ago the family learned of the therapy.

Under the method called aposcalm birthingapos, the baby was propped up while she wriggled out. The whole process was so calm that she barely cried and even fell asleep at one point. After doctors gently woke her up, little Lyla wiggled her torso free, pushed herself out, and pulled her legs free.    Baby Lyla, who weighed lb oz, was born in Southend General Hospital on April , . aposNaturalapos c-sections are considered to be more peaceful than traditional c-sections and the method is being introduced to more hospitals across the UK each year.  Charlotte, an emergency police call handler from Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, said: The whole birthing experience was so calm and peaceful - I felt so relaxed as they really kept the environment free of stress.    As it was a planned c-section, I got to walk myself to the theatre, sit on the operating table and take some time to mentally prepare myself with my partner by my side. The whole team of doctors and nurses spoke to me throughout and talked me through every step of the way. The strange thing with a c-section is you canapost see or feel what is actually happening to you, so you have to rely on others to tell you. Before I knew it, Lyla was out - she didnapost cry initially and as you can see on the video, she even fell asleep half way out of my tummy, so it must have been a calm experience for her too. Charlotte fell pregnant with her first child Annalee in  and after splitting with the father, she moved from Prittlewell to Florida with her parents.She tried to give birth naturally but at the time of the birth, Annaleeaposs heart rate dropped and doctors discovered Charlotteaposs hips were too narrow. So she was rushed in for an emergency c-section. She said: It was terrying. One minute I was being induced, and the next minute I had lots of doctors and nurses running around me. They quickly prepped me for surgery and rushed me in for an emergency c-section after Annaleeaposs heart rate dropped.    I was only -years-old, I felt very panicked and scared and it was just all happening way too quickly. Thankfully, the c-section went well and Annalee was fine and healthy, but the whole experience traumatised me. Charlotteaposs family moved back to the UK in , and she started a new le in Leigh-on-Sea. She began dating Ricky in July  and fell pregnant two years later, in July . She said: I knew when I got pregnant with my second that I wouldnapost be able to go through a natural delivery.    It did make me sad to think that Iaposd never be able to experience a natural birth, but having a baby was a blessing regardless of how they enter the world. I wanted to have this birth be a beautul and calm experience for me and our baby, despite being on the operating table. With Lyla being Rickyaposs first child as well, I wanted it to be something magical for him as well without all the fear that I went through the first time. Rickyaposs mother Tracy Wright, , who is a midwe, assisted with Charlotteaposs second birth and helped capture the birth on video.     Tracy said: Iaposve helped so many babies come into the world, and when Charlotte asked me to be in the room with her, I couldnapost say yes fast enough! Iaposve never actually helped with a aposnaturalapos c-section birth before, so it was wonderful that Charlotte could be my first one as well. Delivering my own granddaughter into the world was just incredible, and it is an experience I will never forget. Lyla is now four and took on the role of bridesmaid in March  alongside sister Annalee when Charlotte and Ricky got married.

We can reveal the Northern Ireland minister, son of Conservative Party grandee Douglas Hurd, appears with ex-we Kim in a copy of the depraved financier’s contacts published online. Old Etonian Mr Hurd last night ­denied ever meeting Epstein, who was a friend of Prince Andrew and killed himself in jail last month, aged . It is believed the Hurds’ contact ­details were passed to the billionaire by British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, . She is the daughter of the disgraced late newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell and an “old friend” of Kim’s from ­university. Maxwell is accused of being Epstein’s “madam” which she has denied. The address book ­features two previous home ­addresses, along with five telephone numbers for Mr Hurd. It also lists a personal email for the -year-old, who orced Kim in .  Asked why the ­contact details were in the book, Mr Hurd said he had not consented to their inclusion, adding: “I never met with or spoke to Jeffrey Epstein.” Kim also denied ever meeting Epstein but said: “Ghislaine Maxwell is an old friend from university days.” Mr Hurd was Minister of State for Industry and Climate Change in Theresa May’s regime from July  to June  at the newly created Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. He was then Minister of State for Policing and the Fire Service, ­quitting this July for the Ulster post. Mr Hurd has also served as Minister for London since November . Before becoming the MP for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner in , he worked for a British bank based in Brazil. It is believed Epstein acquired the contact details around the time Mr Hurd set up the Small Business Network, which he started in  to advise the Conservative Party on business policy. The revelation came as images emerged of former Labour spin doctor Lord Mandelson – another pal of Maxwell and also listed in Epstein’s contact book – holidaying with the ­disgraced financier on St Barts in the Caribbean. The shot were taken in , just six months before Epstein was ­arrested for having sex with a minor.     It was claimed yesterday that Maxwell could face raps as investigators close in on the women who allegedly helped Epstein systematically abuse girls. US federal authorities are preparing possible charges that include sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy against people who arranged Epstein’s alleged crimes, two sources close to the probe told The New York Times. So far, no Epstein associates have been charged or named as co-conspirators. But Maxwell, who denies any wrongdoing, and others have been accused in private lawsuits of recruiting, training and maintaining a network of teenage girls that Epstein used for sex. The Duke of York, who faces growing pressure to reveal what he knew, has said that on no occasion did he “see, witness or suspect” any inappropriate behaviour by Epstein."},{"url":null,"title":"king george vi told wish","story":"NewsKing George VI was told to wish Adolf Hitler happy birthday to stave off WWDeclassied Government documents show how a Cabinet meeting debated whether King George VI should send a birthday message to the Nazi leader in ShareCommentsBySteven Taylor:,  AUG NewsGerman dictator Adolf Hitler giving the Nazi salute in \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

I obviously booked the cheapest accommodation in Brooklyn, so I knew it wasnapost going to be amazing, and I normally choose the cheapest one wherever I go. The worst part of the room is probably the bed, but also the fact that it gets super hot because thereaposs no fan, so I have to sleep with the window open, which is obviously not safe and also means I can hear everyone shouting in the street outside. But Ms Reeve said while the space resembling Harry Potteraposs staircase room was not what she expected, it is not a big deal for her as it allows people like her to travel on a budget.   She posted photos and videos of the room on Twitter and Instagram but they were later deleted.According to Business Insider, when Ms Reeve contacted her host, he said the person who was supposed to clean the apartment failed to so. The host apologised, pointed her to clean sheets, and refunded the cleaning fee.The Airbnb listing , however, explicitly states the size and condition of the room and provides photos of the tiny room and mattress.It reads: The space is ideal for backpackers and other budget travelers who are comfortable sleeping on a self inflating camping pad with another camping pad underneath.

Vladislava Trokhimchuk, , abandoned her son Danill and daughter Anna, two, for  days without food or water in a house of horrors. The children were so hungry they ate wallpaper and plaster covers, as well as their own excrement. Trokhimchuk was jailed for eight years for the death of Danill - and the sentence has sparked outrage from critics arguing it was too lenient. Anna miraculously survived by drinking water from a vase but was suffering from acute malnutrition when she was rescued from the flat.    Trokhimchuk was jailed for deliberately seeking to starve her infants and murder in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. Prosecutors said Danill died on December , , and his sister was alone with his body for three days. She intended to post pictures on social media in an appeal claiming one or both had a le threatening tumour in a sick bid to pocket money for herself, the Goloseevsky District Court heard. The mother “tortured her children for profit”, reported Fakty newspaper.    Judge Galina Bondarenko called her “cynical and heartless” but the sentence she imposed has sparked an outcry. An appeal is expected with demands for a le sentence. The Kyiv prosecutoraposs office said: In connection with this, the prosecutor’s office is preparing an appeal to the Kyiv Court of Appeal demanding a review of the verdict. When the mother heard the sentence by live TV link to her detention cell she was seen laughing and clapping her hands.    After taking into account remission and the time she spent in detention after the December  crime, Vladislava will be free in three years. The toddlers could not leave their nursery-from-hell because a towel was wedged in the doorway to stop them getting to the kitchen. Their teeth marks were found on the walls where they tried to eat wallpaper.  They desperately tore linoleum off the floor trying to open a gap under the door. There was food in the fridge, but the children couldnapost get to it. Psychiatrists ruled the mother was mentally fit to face trial. The mother spent the  days she was absent - two days longer than earlier reported - with her new lover and their baby daughter. Her former mother-in-law had tried to gain access to the flat, but had no key, said her ex-husband Alexey Trokhimchuk, the children’s father.  It was the mother who found them after  days. Anna was unconscious and Danill was dead. She told police: “I went to the children - with groceries, and toys. Anna was lying on the bed, sleeping. “I woke her, gave cottage cheese, and a banana. I kept her in my arms. “And then everything was like in a terrible dream. I do not understand how it happened.  She confessed: “I cannot find an excuse for myself. “I always wanted the best for children. “I dreamed they would study, live dferently than I do, better. That they would have everything. “I repent very much.  “I cannot understand what I did, or that God took my son from me and put me here .” Yet in the dock she was seen laughing. A police source said she was with her new lover, Anton Podchapko. ”She was having fun with him while her children were being tortured to death,” said the source.  Mr Podchapko told Fakty that Vladislava had told him that the children were with their grandmother while she was with him. The mother’s landlord Mikhail Gorovoy said the sentence was shockingly lenient after taking into account her time indention and remission. “The murderer who doomed such a little one to death has got just three years in jail,” he said. His we Yulia Gorovaya said: “I am lost, I am upset, I just do not know how this could happen.” Nadezhda Maksimets, spokeswoman of Kyiv Prosecutor’s Office, said: “As a mother of two children, I am simply shocked.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d63e2fec534c2.18919648-406x564.jpg ","title":"bard of salford john cooper clarke promises a right good night in dundee visit","story":"John Cooper Clarke is ready to rock# and Dundee should be afraid, very afraid.He may be in his older years, but he is not holding back.And the man known as the punk poet has vowed to perform in his unmistakable style – machine gun delivery studded with factory floor language.The rasping Salford accent is still there and the humour as cutting as a surgeon’s scalpel.And for the real devotees, John has teased them by telling the Tele exclusively that he has begun planning his memoirs.In typical fashion he says: “I haven’t kept a f****** diary, but I have got a good memory.“In fact, my memory is long and my vengeance is total.”To the musicians and celebs who have crossed JCC in the past, start praying now because the master could even recall the gig I saw him perform at Strathclyde University in the early s and who was playing on the same bill.For the record, it was Siouxsie and the Banshees – and I couldn’t remember that, despite being a few years younger than the man.Back in the day, John easily recalls everyone being angry young men and women.

There are clever lighting and curtain effects that make the area quite attractive.We were brought a bottle of water and the cocktails, wine and food menus.Our waitress explained they had  Brewing beers on tap though there were bottles available too. My husband enjoys the likes of Peroni or Coors, but these aren’t sold here. He took a bottle of Lagunitas IPA, on our server’s recommendation, and I knee-jerked into Bacardi and diet coke as I was unsure of what  they had and a request for Kahlua had met with a blank stare. It would be goodthey perhaps did a beer and spirits menu too. vw, px\"  The drinks came and we were told the soupswere langoustine chowder and one I didn’t order .Other starters included chicken and duck liver parfait with rhubarband hot smoked salmon with pickled egg yolk . Across the table the choice was for scallops, apples and alliumsan unusual combination, we thought, but he loves scallops. The mains choices range from the £ mark, with a few vegetarian options – spelt grain and barley risotto and a courgette lasagne being two.I struggled a little bit with the menu – a lot of the dishes contained elements I just don’t like, chicken with sweetcorn ragout, duck with spiced pear, sea trout with pea veloute. I’m not sophisticated enough for this!I was on the steak option – Campbell’s Gold ribeyeor steak frites, oz flat iron steak , I chose the latter as I hadn’t had it before. My other half chose the grilled whole sea bream with rocket, orange and pine nut salad . vw, px\"  My soup was served with a poppy seeded roll – I was a little disappointed that bread hadn’t put on the table to nibble on while we waited – but my roll and soup were very nice. The chowder had lots of finely chopped veg in it.The seafood was also served in a bowl and the four quite small scallops didn’t seem to merit the price tag. However, they were cooked to perfection and the mix with the apple and alliumwas fabulous. But another couple wouldn’t have gone amiss. vw, px\"  The mains came – my steak was medium rare as requested and served on a warmed marble plate with the chips in a separate dish.My husband agreed to having his fish filleted. The server used two spoons to cut off the head and tail and get the backbone etc out. She did warn there would still be bones in it and, unfortunately, there were quite a few. I’d have found this off-putting, but he coped manfully. vw, px\"  I shared my pile of chips and steak – the chips were to die for, crispy and tasty and the steak had a lovely flavour but was a little chewy in places. I’m not familiar with the cut, so perhaps that was due to how I had it cooked.The sea bream was tasty, but I’m not sure it is something we’d order again. vw, px\"  A fellow diner had a burger deliveredand I had a severe case of food envy. It looked wonderful.The desserts were fancy ice cream and sorbet and a bruleebut we decided to go for the Scottish and French cheeses .The plate came with six pieces of cheese, oatcakes, chutney and pickled grapes. It was very pleasant and I loved the chutney, though I wouldn’t rush to eat another pickled grape!I had an espresso martiniwhile my other half – who’d swapped his beer with me – ordered himself a second Bacardi. My first espresso martini, it was interesting – like a very cold coffee with a kick."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d6640cb1b2e79.77615256-509x564.jpg ","title":"dundee boss james mcpake we believe we have the quality in our team","story":"His team’s strength so far this season has been at the back but boss James McPake insists Dundee are going to Tannadice on Friday night to have a go.To date, the Dark Blues have chalked up six clean sheets in their eight competitive outings, but James’ sights in the derby will be focused firmly on taking three points back up to Dens Park.“In a derby the onus is on both teams, you just go,” he said.“You go down there and you have your game plan as a team and we believe we have the quality in our team.“We’ve got strikers that will be worrying them I fully believe that – Kane Hemmings, Andrew Nelson and Danny Johnson.”James is well aware of how well United, with three wins from three, have started their Championship campaign and, like every other manager in the ision, knows the threat posed by free-scoring striker Lawrence Shankland.Any steps he takes to deal with the second tier’s top scorer, however, will be part of an overall plan to cope with the Tangerines as a whole.James added: “It’s stopping Dundee United, that’s what we need to do.

with a close range effort.Ross County twice hit the woodwork, once from the penalty spot.Aberdeen made four changes to the side that stuttered to a dire - stalemate with Kilmarnock at Rugby Park last weekend.Two were enforced with Scott McKenna and Shaleum Logan both ruled out through injury.Centre-back McKenna is out for up to a month with a hamstring tear suffered on the articial surface at Rugby Park.Right-back Logan was ruled out having undergone a minor procedure on a groin problem.It meant Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes had only four fit defenders available # with no defensive back up on the bench.However they secured a clean sheet.Wingers Ryan Hedges and Niall McGinn both ed to the starting line-up with James Wilson and Jon Gallagher dropping to the bench.Aberdeen began with attacking intent and forced two corners inside the opening two minutes but both came to nothing.The Reds should have taken the lead in the ninth minute when Ryan Hedges played a quick free quick to release Niall McGinn on the right flank.McGinn#ss low cross was palmed out by keeper Ross Laidlaw as far as Sam Cosgrove who capitalized to shoot low from  yards only to have his shot cleared off the line by Keith Watson.Aberdeen spurned another glorious opportunity in the th minute when Greg Leigh broke down the left and squared a pass into the penalty area but with the goal beckoning McGinn lted it high over the bar from  yards.In the rd minute Ferguson curled a free kick from the left into the box which Mikey Devlin met but his  yard glancing header flew wide.The Dons two game Premiership goal drought ended in the th minute with a set piece straight off the training ground.Rather than fire a free kick  yards out directly into the penalty area McGinn slid it wide to the unmarked Hedges on the right who immediately whipped in a curling cross that found LEIGH.The left-back powered home a  yard header beyond keeper Laidlaw.Aberdeen doubled their advantage two minutes later when Ferguson was clumsily brought down in the box by keeper Laidlaw.Leading scorer COSGROVE comfortably converted to the keeper#s left hand side for his th goal of the season.Aberdeen made it # in the th minute when McGinn cut inside on the left and delivered a superb cross towards the back post and HEDGES raced from the right to slide it in from close range.A minute later Ross County were awarded a penalty by referee Nick Walsh when a powerful drive from Stewart hit Funso Ojo#s hand from close range.Ojo was booked. Staggies failed to capitalize as Billy McKay#s spot kick rattled Joe Leiws# right hand post.Aberdeen continued to threaten when McGinn shot over the bar then minutes later Cosgrove had an effort saved by keeper Laidlaw.In the th minute Stewart broke in on goal and unleashed a curling shot that cracked off the far post from  yards. It was the second time the Staggies were denied by the woodwork.It could have been - in the th minute when a low drive from Wright  yards out was blocked by keeper Laidlaw.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Vyner, Devlin, Considine, Leigh, Ojo, Ferguson, Bryson, McGinn, Hedges, Cosgrove.Subs: Wright , Gallagher ,  Anderson Subs not used: Cerny, McLennan,  Wilson, Main.ROSS COUNTY : Laidlaw, Fraser, Morris, Gardyne, McKay, Vigurs, Grivosti, Mullin, Watson, Foster, Stewart.Subs: Spittal , Graham , Power Subs not used: Ruddy, Chalmers, Paton, Reid.Referee: Nick Walsh"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44956849-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44956849-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44956849-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44956849-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"boss knows pressure is on for a win but says it always is with reds","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes accepts the pressure is on to win today – but insists it is the same scenario for every match.The Dons have won just once in the last five games in all competitions.That victory came in the League Cup at Championship Dundee and required a th-minute equaliser to force extra-time.Prior to that Aberdeen crashed out of the Europa League - on aggregate to Croatian side Rijeka.A - stalemate at Kilmarnock last weekend made it just four points from the opening three Premiership matches.McInnes knows the heat is on but said: “The pressure is never off Aberdeen.“There is always a pressure to win, especially at home.“I know more than most what is required here.“We need to remind folk we won the cup tie at Dundee off the back of a European tie.“Although - at Kilmarnock wasn’t good enough from my point of view and we still expect more, in isolation it isn’t the worst result in the world.”Aberdeen’s defence has been hit by three injury set-backs this week.Following scans on an injury sustained at Rugby Park it was confirmed Scotland international centre-back Scott McKenna will be out for up to a month with a hamstring tear.Centre-back Ash Taylor also suffered a setback in his rehabilitation from a hamstring tear that has sidelined the summer signing since the - Europa League draw with Chikhura Sachkhere in Georgia on July .Aberdeen are awaiting the results of a scan but it is feared Taylor will be ruled out for a number of weeks.The Reds will also give a late fitness test to Shaleum Logan after the right-back underwent a minor procedure on a groin problem.If Logan is unavailable McInnes will have just four defenders available for the clash with the Staggies – Andy Considine, Greg Leigh, Mikey Devlin and Zak Vyner.McInnes has challenged the Dons to go into the upcoming international break buoyed by a victory.He said: “We are looking forward to the challenge of winning three points and feeling a bit better about ourselves.“We want to look at the league table and be a bit happier with that.“It is important we just concentrate on our own performance and that we bring a strong team performance.“The players will be absolutely fine this season and it is important we try to get the three points.“We know the level of performance we are capable of so it is up to us to try to find that.”Ross County suffered a heavy - home defeat to Livingston last weekend but McInnes is full of praise for co-managers Stuart Kettlewell and Steven Ferguson.He said: “By and large Stuart and Steven have done a brilliant job.“In their first full season they won the Challenge Cup and also promotion.“They have been very impressive.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.43190103-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.43190103-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.43190103-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.43190103-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"car overturns on north east road 3","story":"A car has overturned on a busy north-east road.The accident happened on the A Regent Street in Keith at around pm.The occupant of the car suffered #very minor injuries#, according to a Police Scotland spokesman.He added: #A car ended up on its roof.#We#re waiting for the vehicle to be recovered.#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.43190103-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.43190103-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.43190103-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.43190103-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"groups building community ties","story":"A Men#s Shed group has loaned a hand to build a playhouse for children.To get the organisation’s name out there, the Men’s Shed has been looking for projects in which they can make a dference to the Bridge of Don community.Members have been busy in recent weeks, and most recently helped nursery children at Braehead School by creating a playhouse for them.It is hoped more initiatives will be taken on.Secretary of the group Eric Bisset said: “We’re looking for hands-on things.“We’re not going to do people’s gardens, as we don’t want to take away from local companies, butit’s something that will benefit the community we’d be happy to do it.“We’ve got lots of ideas.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives. There is also support for parents and carers.At SDS centres customers can get information, advice and guidance about jobs, the local labour market, training courses and apprenticeships as well as how to prepare for interviews and help with CVs and applications.The work of SDS careers advisers in schools and centres is supported by Scotland’s careers website myworldofwork, where you can access advice  hours a day. It is packed with career information, advice and tools such as the CV builder. There is also a dedicated exam results section.Details of the local SDS centres are available at myworldofwork centres and information about events and opportunities is also available on Facebook.Pauline Graham, Project Manager for the SDS Exam Results HelplineSir,I had a great time at this year#s Islay Show. It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"lets get our mojo working","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStarting out in , Lost in Berlin is the creation of Ardrishaig-based wordsmith Russell Taylor.The name Lost in Berlin could be seen as an apt metaphor for society#s sometimes confused state.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

coincide with a full council meeting, and waved flags, shouted slogans and played lsquoMoney Money Moneyrsquo by ABBA on a PA system.Speaking at the demonstration, Willie Thomson, a regional industrial organiser for Unite, said that the dispute could risk the regionrsquos winter maintenance programme.He said: ldquoThe reason why the men are taking action is basically a refusal from Scottish Borders Council to respect the terms and conditions of their employment.ldquoThey have had changes imposed on them that will cost them poundrsquos, and they are not willing to have that done to them.ldquoThe reason they are striking is to send a strong message that the council needs to get back round the table and reach an agreement with the workers.ldquoThe people of the Scottish Borders need to be aware that the council is risking their winter maintenance service.ldquoDuring the winter maintenance service members do a lot of extra hours to keep up with the extra demand.ldquoWersquore now in a position where members will be withdrawing that programme.ldquoThat work is done a voluntary basis and the good will that is required to do that is in short supply.Currently, summer standby for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos road workers is voluntary, but council chiefs are trying to make this mandatory, in line with other sections of the council.Earlier this year, Scottish Borders Council notied the unions that not enforcing the same terms and conditions across the whole council could leave the local authority open to gender pay discrimination claims, as the mainly male roads section of the council is not required to be on standby over the summer, whereas the mainly female care home staff are.Summer standby payment for roads workers is currently pound., albeit it on a voluntary basis, and Scottish Borders Council is offering to up this to pound as long as it becomes mandatory.The two main unions which represent road workers at Scottish Borders Council, Unite and Unison, have been in discussion with the council ever since it informed employees that the terms and conditions would change.However, the talks with Unite broke down, and .% of the unionrsquos members who voted in an industrial ballot voted for strike action. The turn out was %.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos chief executive Tracey Logan,said: ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.ldquoIt is a principle of fairness and equality for staff across the whole workforce and one which I would expect Unite as representatives of staff to uphold and commit to."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bar-cream-crop-scottish-cuisine","story":"A BAR and restaurant is the toast of Selkirk after winning the Best Scottish Cuisine title at Food Awards Scotland .The celebration of the countrys best restaurants, takeaways, pubs, hotel restaurants, cafes and bistros was held last week in Glasgow.Within the restaurant category it was the The Fleece Bar  Kitchen which was announced as cream of the crop when it comes to presenting Scottish cuisine.Trevor and Tracey Ward, who have owned the historic Selkirk inn since , were delighted with the latest accolade.Tracey told us: \"Wersquore absolutely delighted to have been awarded this accolade which celebrates the very best Scotland has to offer in the hospitality industry.\"To win the category of Best Scottish Cuisine when wersquore a family run restaurant situated in a small Borders town, is testament to the commitment and focus of our staff and the support we have from our customers and the community.\"There were some great, long established restaurants in our category and for us to have come out on top was a welcome surprise!Over the past three years the Wards, along with trainee chef son Ryan, have been rewarded with a regular stream of five-star reviews from delighted customers.And the awards shelf is filling up as quickly as their restaurant diary.Another Borders establishment which was also honoured last week at the Food Awards Scotland was Stewarts Cafe Bistro in Jedburgh.The High Street business was named as the regional Cafe Bistro winner.Creative Oceanic has been organising and hosting the awards for the past six years.CEO Irfan Younis told us: ldquoCongratulations to all winners and finalists at the sixth Food Awards Scotland .\"We welcomed and rewarded some of the best in the Scottish food industry who serve us up some of the tastiest food, enhance our culture, deliver top quality customer service and provide us with some of the best banter around.

The overall revenue budget for the upkeep of parks across the Borders is contained within the budget for neighbourhood services and no savings are projected from this budget as a result of the play programme.ldquoThe removal of old play equipment from playparks, which following appraisal, deemedto be low value facilities, will allow for sufficient resources to be deployed to maintain thenew facilities being invested in by the council through the outdoor community spacescapital project on an ongoing basis.ldquoThe new facilities include more pieces of equipment, widening access and providinghigher play value than the previous, aged, low-amenity, play equipment. Thedecommissioning of the older low value facilities will ensure the revenue impact to the parks and environment service budget is cost neutral.ldquoI would further confirm that no play park will be decommissioned until such times as thenew play park investment in that locality is complete.ldquoMembers should also note that no town or village which currently has a play park will beleft without one following the upgrade process.Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson also queried the council leader, asking for an update on the proposed closure of eleven parks in her ward.Councillor Haslam told the chamber: ldquoThe council requested feedback to the programme for decommissioning of play parks with an end date of August .ldquoOfficers will now undertake a review of the feedback and, where appropriate, respond prior to implementing the council decision.ldquoIn announcing a signicant investment in outdoor community facilities the council recognised the need to address the historic over provision of low value playparks, indeed the council is in amongst the largest providers of play parks per  head of population when compared to similar authorities, however when it comes to quality it is amongst the lowest in play value terms.ldquoThe council decision to invest in destination playparks and decommission those play parks which are obsolete does not remove the spaces from fulfilling an important community need in terms of access to open spaces.ldquoThese spaces can be used for informal play and have the potential to help the council address other issues such as its obligation to identy places for community food growing.Scottish Borders Council recently spent pound, on a new playpark at Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre, near Ancrum, which follows on from new parks built in Galashiels, Oxton, and Stow.The council also opened up a new playpark in Hawick in  as part of the regeneration of WIlton Lodge Park, and Coldstream is set to be next to receive a new playpark with a pound, facility set to open in Home Park at the end of the month."},{"url":null,"title":"driving-legend-jackie-opens-museum-39-great-friend-39","story":"SIR Jackie Stewart praised Jim Clark as a driver and as a friend when he officially opened the refurbished Jim Clark Museum on Thursday in Duns.Clark won two Formula  World Championships, in  and , claiming overall a total of  Grand Prix victories with  pole starts, and also the Indianapolis  in  before he died in a horric crash at Hockenheim in .Sir Jackie, who later was flying off to Spain for the weekendrsquos Grand Prix, recalled his friendship with Clark.And he revealed how he regularly visited the Borders to meet up with his lsquogreat friend.He said: ldquoWhen Jim Clark was racing he was my hero and was certainly the best racing driver I ever raced against.\"We had a great le together and he was an enormous help to me.

The tragedy is I cannot tell my grandchildren the same because we messed up.ldquoBut so long as there are young people like those I met on Zomba Plateau about, we can have hope and faith in a future where all can share the bounty of this beautul creation.Afterwards, the youngsters moved on to the Liwonde Game Reserve where they helped restore no less than fourteen houses damaged in the severe floods of March.Then everyone got to experience a safari drive, many of whom for the first time, seeing elephants, hippos, warthogs, and lions up close.Also, a site visit was arranged to YONECO, one of the main sponsors of the camp, to learn of their special approach to promoting youth empowerment.To reinforce the talk the RYLA participants engaged with the women who live on the Plateau and men who make a living there passing on their newfound knowledge on how to minimise the effects of Climate Change.And handed out mango plants in small plastic sleeves that will provide a crop of fruit in three years.Nineteen-year-old leader, John Little said: ldquoThe pilot Malawi RYLA camp was a massive success.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

One way we can fight back against ecological collapse is to have wilder, unmown, unsprayed spaces around us. Short grass and manicured parks may look neat but itrsquos vital to have flourishing wild spaces too.Rewilding East Lothian wants the council to commit to planting thousands more trees to help absorb the carbon dioxide emissions that are driving global warming.In addition, the council has been challenged to radically reduce mowing and weed-killing, since weeds provide homes for bees and other pollinators, and to mitigate the loss of green spaces to housing by proactively making dedicated areas for nature to flourish.A council spokeswoman said East Lothianrsquos reputation as the Garden County was ldquoappreciated by residents and visitors alike.

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"onboard-volunteers-dedicated-saving-scotland-39-s-dolphins-whales","story":"I head below.

But they are under threat: from noise, pollution, discarded fishing gear and even tourism. A Cuvierrsquos beaked whale stranded on Skye in  died with its belly full of plastic bags. Over a hundred of the deep-ing whales were found dead last summer in the north Atlantic, most of them in Scotland. Military sonar is a strong suspect.Entanglements in creel ropes and other equipment is a regular problem for cetaceans and seals, with a dead whale in Scrabster recently tangled in creel gear from Nova Scotia. Last but not least, marine mammals are victims of their own popularity. Tourists crowd onto boats to see them, and tour operators are under pressure to provide ever-closer encounters. Scottish Wildle Trust has called for tougher controls on tourism operations.The data from the Silurian ndash collected in , hours of volunteer work on more than  trips on the west coast ndash is crucial. The Trustrsquos science officer Lauren Hartny-Mills gives an example: having hard facts enables it and other agencies in the Scottish Entanglement Alliance to engage with fishing operators over why entanglements happen and their impacts, and come up with solutions.She says: ldquoNo entanglement is intentional and itrsquos really upsetting for the fishers who find these animals in distress in their gear, but they also lose money from cutting animals free and lost fishing time.Survey information is used to find where marine animals and fishing gear clash, and photo data collected on surveys can give clues to what injuries cetaceans suffer at the hands of man-made objects and machinery.And the data is particularly important because Government consultations are afoot for four new Marine Protected Areas in Scottish waters, three off the west coast, including a , sq km one in the Sea of the Hebrides.Data from the Silurian has been key in defining that last MPA and a smaller one off the north east coast of Lewis. HWDT information on the movements of minke whales and Rissorsquos dolphins and other creatures will help the Scottish Government set the MPA rules under which fishing, tourism and development are regulated.After heading west out of Tobermory in the early morning, we face the full force of the weather as we turn south-west into the sea lane between Mull, Coll and Tiree. With me on the boat are volunteers Jenny Hampson, based on Mull, and Andy Tait, whorsquos from the north-east of England but spends much of his time on the island. The rest of the six-strong volunteer complement is made up of young undergraduates, mainly marine science students, who combine knowledge of the sea environment and its problems with an enthusiasm and delight in the wildle.Mancunian Hampson is studying for a masters in marine mammal science at St Andrews, and was a full-time volunteer for the trust for nine months. She s like an extra member of staff, knowing the routines and the rules from helping out on previous trips.As the rolling eases near the dramatic little Treshnish Isles, I head below again where shersquos at work. Information on species, direction of travel, distance and behaviour of any animal spotted is yelled down from the watch team on the mast, and she shows me how itrsquos put into a database and turned into statistics.In the rough conditions and rain itrsquos much harder to see anything on the surface, and thatrsquos where the hydrophone towed behind the boat comes into its own.Hampson explains it collects the sounds of porpoises, which are plotted into the database. It also shows up the whistles of dolphins, the snapping sounds made by shrimps, and things such as the acoustic deterrent devices which blare out sound to drive seals away from fish farms.ldquoI wanted to do this since I was about five ndash I have always been one of those whale nuts, says Hampson.Tait has been a volunteer for HWDT since it started in . On his trips hersquos seen orca, four dferent species of dolphin as well as masses of other wildle ndash hersquos good on bird identication too.ldquoI do it all because I love wildle. This is what I live for now since I retired, he says.Wersquore on only the third of a new series of winter-months surveys by Silurian. In the past she has normally sailed from April to October only, taking paying volunteers on trips of up to  days across the Hebrides, counting the mammals as they go. That has built up a wealth of data but more information is needed.This trip is paid for out of a grant from the Scottish Governmentrsquos wildle agency Scottish Natural Heritagendash HWDT will get a total of around pound, over three years year from SNH for its survey work ndash and these winter surveys are dferent, drawing on local volunteers to do similar work for shorter periods, at short notice, as weather windows allow.Volunteers go free on the three-day trips but they have to put up with the lurching winter seas, and sometimes worse: on Januaryrsquos trip they were chipping ice off the deck. More winter surveys will follow over the next two years, giving scientists the first proper picture of what west coast cetacean and seal populations are like in winter and how they behave.We turn east, and my second night aboard is spent moored in a small cove on the north side of Ulva, off the coast of Mull, whose inhabitants famously won more than pound million from the Scottish Government to buy the island and tempt people to repopulate it.From here it looks bleak and inhospitable, and we scrap a plan for a run ashore in favour of sketching, board games and chat before an early night. Some of the students sit drawing simple outlines of marine mammals, trying to capture the essence of the creatures, the movement that makes their massive forms so graceful.Everyone helps with cooking and clearing up, with Burgess and first mate Brian Condon giving a gentle guiding hand.The next day we retrace our steps, and as we turn back into the Sound of Mull, and get the stf south-west wind behind us, the engine is switched off and we come under pure sail.Four oyster catchers pass, much faster than the boat, bouncing in the wind as they dip and flit. The light, down into the sound and in towards the folded land, is shting in the heaps of mist and cloud. A rag of blue sky slips away, the brightness briefly lighting the toe of the ness ahead.On deck the volunteers are concentrating hard on the count. We have seen seals and harbour porpoise, but so far none of the larger marine mammals. However hard yoursquore looking, though, itrsquos dficult not to be distracted by the beauty around you.Burgess tells me this interplay of light and sea is what she loves. ldquoPeople ask meI get bored with just sea and sky to look at. But even when yoursquore right out at sea with no land in sight, it changes all the time ndash itrsquos fascinating.As skipper and boat manager she commands her one crew member, decides where and how we travel, looks after motley volunteers including myself, and helps ensure the vital survey work is done properly. As she steers the boat she tells me she ldquofell back into the west coast of Scotland and became skipper a year ago after working as first mate on Silurian then as a er and sailor around the world.A Mull native who studied marine biology, shersquos from a fishing family and has an ease born of years of familiarity with the boat, the sea and the whole system that keeps us alive in this alien environment. She also chips in on occasion with a reality check about people needing to make a living when volunteer enthusiasm for marine conservation bubbles over.Working the Silurian is a dferent challenge to other sailing jobs. The science comes first and that means travelling in straight lines ndash transects ndash at seven knots, so consistent counts of animals and objects can be made.ldquoWe try to cover as many dferent areas as possible that we havenrsquot done before but the weather quite often doesnrsquot let us go exactly where we want to go, Burgess says. ldquoYou also have to think about where you can anchor on the evening so people get a good nightrsquos rest so they can carry on working the next day.ldquoThen you have the tides, which also dictate where wersquore going, there are massive tidal streams around a lot of the islands. ldquoItrsquos a ever-ending puzzle of trying to work out whatrsquos going to be the most effective way of managing to survey the areas wersquore going to cover.The boat was built in Seattle in  and has led a colourful career: in the s it was picked up by the US Coastguard off the coast of Florida and impounded for smuggling cocaine from Columbia. A few years later she was used by a team filming for the first Blue Planet documentary for the BBC, before being acquired by the Trust in .Burgess says Silurianrsquos considerable weight allows the vessel to batter through much of the bad weather. A refit last year smartened her rigging up, and the combination of sails and engine means she can make the best of any weather.Our third evening is spent moored in the small bay north-west of Castle Duart on the heel of Mull towards Oban. The constant drizzle that soaked the last watch of volunteers has stopped as I step out on deck in the early evening with Becky Dudley, HWDTrsquos marine bioersity officer.We watch fascinated as the moon slides in and out of cloud, throwing silver onto flat dusk water. As we talk a common seal approaches the boat, drawing smiles and coos from the volunteers.Dudley admits to her personal devotion to whales and dolphins: it started with a cetacean-themed quilt-cover as a child. But, she says the science is what matters, and decision-making using hard data is essential: ldquoItrsquos really important for instance that the boundaries and what happens in the MPAs arenrsquot just based on guesswork. You want solid scientic data to show where the animals are, where theyrsquore not, how the populations are doing within that area and how many species are using that area.Later I ask the Trustrsquos director Alison Lomax why it is that peoplersquos unscientic, almost anthropomorphic ideas, draw them towards cetaceans.ldquoWith whales and dolphins therersquos certainly a connection that those types of animals allow you to make, she says ldquoThese animals are so mysterious, we are still learning so much about them, and yet there are so many similarities between us and them in terms of our biology and parts of our behaviour.ldquoFor me itrsquos that key moment where you get just that glimpse of a whale or a dolphin and your world and theirs meets ndash that is something that is quite inspiring, and it brings tears to some peoplersquos eyes.At Castle Duart we are up early next day for a full dayrsquos work before we head back to port. The boat chugs into Loch Linnhe, flat water welcome on the balance and legs, but itrsquos dull compared to the wave-crashing, swell-riding trip to Ulva and back. There are more seals and creels, but not much sign of cetaceans as we head up and around Lismore, then back south around Morven.Then, by the scar of the huge Glensanda quarry, therersquos a wave of excitement. Someone has spotted a common dolphin, the first of the trip after three days, gently rising with a graceful arch of the back, and sliding back below the ruffled water. Every time we think wersquove seen the last of it, it pops up again, close enough and high enough to see the distinctive cream-coloured patches on its sides.Cameras click, and it is recorded in the data base: species, behaviour, direction of travel, bearing from the boat, another small case to add to the thousands logged by the Silurian.Dudley, however, looks concerned. She plans to report the sighting to British Divers Marine Le Rescue . The animal is alone, which is unusual its calm, smooth movement is a bit too gentle for a creature often seen leaping and twisting around. There could be something amiss, and local observers from BDMLR can keep an eye out in case the animal is injured or unwell, and ends up stranded.Later she tells me therersquos been no response to her call, indicating the animal has not been spotted again or got into trouble, but itrsquos another indication of the care HWDT staff take of these animals. The survey work can be enjoyable, there can be glorious moments and exciting sightings, but working on the Silurian, and volunteering on it, is no easy task, as the seasickness taught me. That the Trust, staff and volunteers take this task on, helps not only the animals they care for but the whole marine ecosystem. Whatever drives them, wersquore better off for it.PROTECTION ndash OR JUST PAPER PARKS Four new Marine Protected Areas are proposed by the Scottish Government: the , sq km Sea of the Hebrides MPA the smaller North East Lewis and nearby Shiant East Bank MPAs and the Southern Trench MPA off the Aberdeenshire and Moray coasts.All are supposed to protect a range of animals and features, but data collected by HWDTrsquos teams will be crucial in protecting Minke whales and basking sharks in the Sea of the Hebrides, and Rissorsquos dolphins off Lewis.The Scottish Government is consulting on how they should be defined, and designation does mean some constraints on development. After that there will be y debate over ldquomanagement measures, controlling activity with the MPA areas, with the battle lines likely to be drawn between conservation campaigners and the fishing industry.The consultation document suggests a cost of poundm to the oil and gas, power transmission and fishing industries from the strictest likely control measures, although it says the benefits to the economy could be far greater.Nick Underwood of Scottish conservation charity Open Seas fears the MPAs will be designated but wonrsquot have the rules in place needed to regulate damaging activity. ldquoThese sites are already long delayed ndash there have been worrying delays in the implementation of these MPAs, he says. ldquoThese sites need to be designated as soon as possible with meaningful management. Until that management is in place these are just going to be paper parks.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoOnce designated, these sites will receive new levels of protection which mean decision makers have a legal responsibility to consider the effects of activities on the sites and features."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-scientists-help-retrofit-european-homes","story":"Millions of poorly insulated and ventilated homes across northern Europe are now too hot for summers and too cold for winters.As global heating hits, there have already been warnings, from UK Government advisers, that some of Scotlandrsquos houses may kill, because those of us who live in them will be overheated.But homes that are energy inefficient and ill-suited to the new reality of increasingly changeable weather are common throughout the continent.So scientists and engineers are increasingly trying to work out how to retrofit them.The University of Strathclyde is part of an ambitious initiative that will design state-of-the-art factories to support the renovation of  million homes across Europe that must become energy-neutral before .Supported by Interreg North Sea region , the initiative encompasses the areas of Norway, Denmark, the UK, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden that border the North Sea, currently home to around  million people.Focusing on properties built between  and  that must become more sustainable to meet EU energy and climate targets, the project aims to stimulate the European building sector, which does not currently have the necessary production facilities to support this enormous task.Named Indu-zero, the three-year project aims to industrialise housing by creating a blueprint for an autonomous factory that adopts Industry . technologies and can manufacture , refurbishment kits per year.Similar factories will then follow the blueprint across ious European countries.Placed over a house like a jacket, the refurbishment kits feature clever solutions for sustainable energy production and increased comfort of living, such as solar , heat pumps and ventilation. Signicantly reducing energy costs, they will also contribute substantially to achieving national climate change targets.The University of Strathclydersquos Space Mechatronic Systems Technology Laband Advanced Forming Research Centre , based in its Design, Manufacture  Engineering Management departmentand its Energy System Research Unit , have all joined the consortium with partners from the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Sweden and Norway.ldquoThis is a very ambitious project aiming to address the real challenge faced by millions of people living in energy inefficient homes in the North Sea region. The Universityrsquos multi-disciplinary team have blended their expertise to lead key work packages within this challenging and potentially impactful project, said Professor Xiu Yan, director of SMeSTech lab and Indu-Zero project leader.The AFRC and SMeSTech will create a blueprint of an autonomous factory using expertise in smart manufacturing and advanced digital manufacturing technologies, employing laser scanning techniques to map out renovation packages bespoke to house designs.ESRU will use simulations to assess the energy and comfort impacts of proposed renovation packages to ensure that they are fit for purpose.Indu-Zero brings together parties from dferent countries and fields of expertise. Partners come from the education sector, the construction sector, housing corporations, industry and government.Danny McMahon, senior manufacturing engineer at AFRC, said: ldquoThis is a really exciting project that could have a big impact... on achieving climate targets, reducing energy costs for home owners and boosting sustainability. Manufacturing the packs needed to refurbish  million homes by  is an enormous task, one that the current building sector cannot meet without help.ldquoIndu-Zero is a direct response to this, designing factories that will manufacture renovation kits efficiently, benefiting from new manufacturing technologies and making small quantities per region to decrease transportation needs."},{"url":null,"title":"rock-stars-family-built-scotland-39-s-great-lighthouses","story":"For those in peril on the seas or simply trying to find their way home, the reassuring glow from the lighthouses they built offered a welcome beacon of hope in the dark, stormy night.And for those attempting to navigate Scotland by pony and trap, on horseback or hardy souls on foot, the bridges they designed offered a welcome solution to painful journeys that might otherwise have involved extra miles and even days of exhausting travel.Across theand breadth of the country, harbours, crossings, canals, river improvement works and, of course, scores of lighthouses rooted on rocky outcrops that have sent their warning light into the darkness for more than  years, are stamped with the name of a single pioneering engineering family.While one son, Robert Louis Stevenson, would spurn engineering to achieve fame for his literary achievements, other members of the Stevenson family were busy taming Scotlandrsquos wild coastline, building towering lighthouses that defied the elements.Many, even in this digital age of modern navigation equipment, still shine on through the harshest stormy night, albeit operated by remote control from the heart of Edinburgh.Now a guide to the intricate drawings and plans associated with countless engineering and construction projects carried out by the Stevenson family has been made available online, offering the opportunity to see their incredible craft in a fresh light.Around half of the National Library of Scotlandrsquos collection of more than  items documenting the Stevenson familyrsquos contribution to Scottish engineering history have so far been uploaded to a new online map which plots records of archive items onto their corresponding locations around the country.The map ndash which eventually will include the remaining  maps and documents - offers an insight into the extraordinary extent of the Edinburgh familyrsquos influence on Scottish le, from helping to keep those at sea a little safer, to opening river routes and harbour entrances to ease the passage of vessels, and canals and bridges.Indeed, points out Chris Fleet, Map Curator at the National Library of Scotland, while the Stevenson family may be best known for constructing every lighthouse in Scotland, the plans and designs show that element only made up around % of their work.ldquoBy far the greatest proportion of their work was far more mundane but important aspects of infrastructure like harbours, breakwaters, slipways and even railway and canal projects, he says.ldquoBut it was their initial work in early th century on the Bell Rock lighthouse that gave the family massive publicity.The long and dangerous reef lying  miles east of Dundee and on the route for vessels navigating to and from the Firths of Tay and Forth, had been a cause for concern for decades and was linked to the loss of up to six ships every winter ndash and as many as  during one particularly stormy season.However, it was the sinking of HMS York in  with the loss of all hands that sparked calls for a lighthouse to be erected on Bell Rock a daring proposal given the surface of the rock typically lies under ft of water, emerging only at low tide.Glasgow-born Robert Stevenson had already worked as an apprentice to his step-father Thomas Smith, a lamp-maker appointed by the new Northern Lighthouse Board to construct and manage four lighthouses.Aged , Stevenson had already left his stamp on the nationrsquos most treacherous stretches of coastline when he completed the erection of a lighthouse on Little Cumbrae in the Clyde.He was in his mid-s and had already crafted plans for a Bell Rock lighthouse when the HMS York disaster prompted calls for it to be adopted.In a remarkable feat of endeavour and bravery, workmen defied the crashing waves surrounding the rock to begin their excavation work in .It would take four years of construction before the towerrsquos first beam of light shone ndash alerting countless sailors down the years to the risk and saving innumerable lives in the process.The m tall white and black lighthouse remains the worldrsquos oldest surviving sea-washed lighthouse, although its keepers moved out in  and its light is now operated from the Northern Lighthouse Board offices at  George Street ndash a short distance from the New Town where the Stevenson family made their base.Robert Stevenson went on to serve for nearly  years as engineer to the Northern Lighthouse Board, overseeing the construction and improvements to lighthouses from Sumburgh Head in Shetland, to Barra Head at the southern entrance to The Minch and Scotlandrsquos southernmost point at the Mull of Galloway.His talent for civil engineering ran in the family: his sons, Alan, David and Thomas ndash father of Robert Louis Stevenson ndash would go on to follow in his footsteps.The brothersrsquo lighthouses stretch from the most northerly lighthouse in the British Isles at Muckle Flugga on the Island of Unst ndash  years old and still going strong - to the equally curiously named Chicken House lighthouse on an isolated rocky island at the southern tip of the Isle of Man.At the most isolated, Sule Skerry,  miles west of Orkney and designed to aid the passage of vessels through the Pentland Firth to and from the Iceland seas, keepers would spend a lonely month at a time with just seals, puffins and crashing waves for company.Perhaps the most challenging, however, was the construction of Skerryvore lighthouse. The graceful tower designed by Alan Stevenson is the tallest lighthouse in the country, measuring m of solid granite which were quarried on the Island of Mull throughout its six years of construction.Huge blocks of stone were ferried by tender to Hynish on Tiree to be dressed and shaped to ensure they fitted perfectly into place, before being taken to the site overlooking a reef of treacherous rocks around  miles south west of the island.The family firm was eventually passed to Davidrsquos sons, David Alan and Charles, in the s, and grandson, Charles.But while they continued to specialise in lighthouse design until the s ndash including lighthouses as far afield as New Zealand and Japan, the family also undertook a wide iety of work which helped transform travel and improve infrastructure.Mr Fleet points out that the maps and plans held by the Library show not only the remarkable attention to detail and vision of each designer, but in some cases the changing face of the locations such as harbours which were redesigned to make them safer and easier to navigate, rivers where work was carried out help improve the flow, and roads, bridges and canals which opened swathes of the nation to economic development.However, perhaps the biggest impact of their work is missing from the collection of maps, plans and documents: the countless lives their engineering skills saved.Mike Bullock, Chief Executive of the Northern Lighthouse Board said: ldquoFor over  years Robert Stevenson and his descendants designed and built the majority of Scotlandrsquos Lighthouses.ldquoThey constructed wonders of engineering that have withstood the test of time and the elements.ldquoYou only have to look at Robert Stevensonrsquos Bell Rock Lighthouse, which since  has been continuously safeguarding ships and the lives of their crews and passengers, to recognise their remarkable contribution to our nation."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10345671.jpg?type=article-full","title":"celebrate-tastes-scotland-scottish-food-drink-fortnight","story":"AldomakAldomak are a Scottish confectionery business established in  in Glasgow, supplying the ice cream trade.They manufacture Scottish Tablet, Fudge and Macaroon for a wide array of independents, supermarkets and the tourist trade, and have also branched out into making Handmade Meringues on a large scale, supplying farm shops, delis, hotels and cafes across Scotland.Aldomak are proud of their handmade artisanal credentials and over the years have spent time reimaging traditional recipes and scaling these recipes into large batches, whereby the confectioners pour and cut these by hand, to retain rustic products their customers love.They have also brought two of their own brands to the market, Confectious and Bonnie Glen which was a huge investment for the business.With Aldomak recently being awarded two  stars in the prestigious Great Taste Awards for their Bonnie Glen Vanilla Fudge and Butter Tablet, this validates the quality of their confectionery.Aldomakrsquos MD Dario Riccomini is clearly delighted with how things are going, stating that  has been a good year for the company in raising the profile of the business.

It was also supportive of the Tory Governmentrsquos benefits cap, which critics say has increased poverty.The CSJrsquos latest proposal was to suggest a rise in the state pension age to  by , before another increase to .It argued: ldquoWorking longer has the potential to improve health and wellbeing, increase retirement savings and ensure the full ing of public services for all.However, the plan was denounced by opposition politicians who said older people faced being cheated out of their retirement.It was also noted that the average le expectancy for men in Glasgow is around , raising the prospect of Glaswegians dying before they access their state pension.In a motion at Holyrood, SNP MSP Sandra White said the plan would have a ldquodisproportionate impact on poorer people in Scotland and claimed it was a ldquofurther attack on the elderly.The Herald on Sunday has established that the CSJ, which does not publish details of all the donations it receives, has financial ties to Souter.The businessman, who founded the Stagecoach bus empire, is a high profile Scottish Nationalist who has donated over poundm to the SNP.He and his we Betty also set up a charity, the Souter Charitable Trust, which focuses on projects that promote spiritual welfare and poverty reduction.According to the SCTrsquos latest accounts, the Souter charity gave a pound, grant to the CSJ in  and pledged another pound, as a future commitment.Souter is an evangelical Christian who has used his money to promote independence as well as a range of socially conservative causes.In , he was criticised after spending around poundm on a nationwide referendum to oppose a gay rights measured backed by the then Scottish Executive.In the past, he also met the SNP Government to discuss neuro-electric therapy for drug addicts and his charity has given pound, to an anti-abortion group.Asked what the SCT funding was for, a spokesman for the CSJ said: ldquoThis funding helps support the CSJ which does research into the prevention and alleviation of poverty as per the charityrsquos and our own objectives.He added that the grant had not been been directed towards a specic paper or project.Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer said: \"In communities across Scotland the le expectancy isnt close to .

At the recent European election, his party came fth after tumbling to %.His group of MSPs is also ided and his staunch opposition to a second independence referendum was undermined when shadow chancellor John McDonnell said that a Labour Government would not block indyref.It was against this backdrop of decline that Leonard and his MSPs met at the partyrsquos Bath Street headquarters for an away day last month.MSPs listened to polling expert John Curtice give his take on the current political situation and sessions on campaigning and media messaging were also provided.However, it was the leaderrsquos own presentation that is said to have posed more questions than it offered answers.The ldquochange formula was created by David Gleicher in the s when he worked for the Arthur D Little management consultancy.Described as a model that assesses the ldquolikely success of organisational change programs, the formula was refined in the s by author Kathie Dannemiller.The ldquoD stands for ldquodissatisfaction with how things are, ldquoV is the vision of what it is possible, and ldquoF is the ldquofirst step towards the vision.According to the theory,the product of these three factors is greater than the ldquoR in the formula, which stands for ldquoresistance, then change is possible.One party source said Leonardrsquos chief of staff, Lesley Brennan, who has a background in management consultancy, was likely responsible for the formula being included in the presentation: ldquoOur problem is that lsquoresistancersquo is the voters. They donrsquot like us.Another insider said: ldquoThis kind of managerial jargon is the last thing we need as we try to reconnect with voters. All our opponents have clear, straightforward messages on the constitutional issues dominating politics, while wersquove got DxVxFgtR.Scottish Tory MSP Donald Cameron said: ldquoThese bizarre political equations show what a mess Labour are in.

Carlaw, the partyrsquos deputy leader, agreed to step up on an interim basis until the contest is called.It is understood that the key issue for the Scottish Tories over the next few months will be on whether the party should either split from the UK party or become more autonomous.Davidson won the leadership in  after defeating this proposal, which had been suggested by rival Murdo Fraser.However, senior party figures believe times have changed and a majority of Tory MSPs, as well as a big majority of shadow cabinet members, are said to back a rethink of the relationship with the UK party.Fraser and Adam Tomkins, the partyrsquos shadow constitution secretary, are on the record voicing their support for a revised structure. There is no preferred model, but advocates of change are attracted to setting up a new party purely for Holyrood elections.In comments reported yesterday, Carlaw shot down the idea of a debate.ldquoI just donrsquot think an introspective debate of that character is going to impress people when there are huge issues facing the country, he said.ldquoI do believe we have that independence to develop our own political agenda on devolved issues. That was one of the prizes Ruth won ndash and I think it set us distinctly away from the rest of the UK.Speaking to The Herald on Sunday, a party MSP hit back: ldquoJackson has been slapped down for making these comments. It is fundamentally not his place to make this decision as interim leader. He has been told he cannot make rulings on issues such as this.Supporters of changing the relationship with the UK party want an internal review to examine a range of options, rather than allowing the issue to dominate a leadership contest.The MSP continued: ldquoHaving a review before the contest makes a lot of sense. We are now in a situation where a majority of our parliamentarians in Scotland are willing to explore other models for the structure of the party, and it would be dficult to conduct that debate within the heat of a leadership contest.A second MSP said: ldquoI am in favour of having another structure and we should have a review or a commission report back before the contest. It would look at the pros and cons of all the dferent models.The parliamentarian said the change was not related to Johnson becoming Prime Minister, but it was essential nonetheless. ldquoIt is necessary because there is a growing sense that devolution requires a bespoke party to deal with devolved issues. Scottish politics has been so ided that we need our own voice.A third MSP said: ldquoIt would be f****** stupid not to be talking about this.Potential leadership contenders include MSPs Carlaw, Fraser, Tomkins, Donald Cameron, Dean Lockhart, Miles Briggs, Liam Kerr and Michelle Ballantyne. An MP could also stand.A party spokesman said: ldquoJackson is more than happy for a debate to take place within the party.

Paul has been discussing, as have Lesley [Laird, MP] and others, future arrangements which the party will obviously be considering. An incoming Labour Government would not want, or welcome, or support an independence referendum in Scotland.Meanwhile, Corbyn also told the gathering that next week is the ldquolast chance to stop a no-deal Brexit.ldquoWe will do absolutely everything we can to prevent a no-deal Brexit and the Prime Minister taking us into the hands of Donald Trump and a trade deal with the USA.ldquoThat is the real agenda of the Prime Minister.

So the co-leader of the Scottish Greens should be pretty positive. And he is. But, as a populist hard-right Brexit looms, the Glasgow MSP also admits the right have been better than the left at turning despair into votes.The Scottish Greens have chosen an old printworks, Civic House, just under the M flyover at Cowcaddens, to unveil their plan, the first working of what they aim will one day turn in to a programme of government.This venue, home to a vegan canteen and work spaces, is now community owned. Its distressed brick walls smell of wet cement. ldquoHope is hard work these days, Harvie says after stepping away from his podium. ldquoJust look around the world at the climate emergency.ldquoOur generation is being given a stern lecture by young people who are rightly angry at the way their world is being trashed.

The new UK Government ndash ldquothe most far-right in modern history, he says ndash is a major source of anger too.Before his speech, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had just announced that he intends to suspend the House of Commons. Gathered Greens believe the Prime Minister had done so to foil opposition plans to prevent no deal.From the floor an activist refers to the move as a coup.Harvie responds: ldquoI doubt there is anybody in the room who would disagree with the word you said.ldquoThere is a huge job of work in articulating the anger we have to not let him get away with this project.ldquoFor many of them in the Brexit camp it never was just about being in or out of the European Union. It is about wrenching us from an economic model ndash which we criticise and want to improve ndash towards something far worse, something closer to the US.How did it get to this  How did the UK come to be careering towards what Harvie calls ldquodisaster capitalism ldquoI think the right are better at exploiting a crisis than the left are, he says. ldquoTen-plus years ago, when you had a financial crisis, it was created by that centre-right, deregulated, free-market, neoliberal model which could never last, by debt-fuelled casino capitalism.ldquoI am afraid the right have been more effective at exploiting that crisis and the left have not.ldquoNot just the Greens but the left generally need to get better at connecting with people who feel failed, because they have been been failed.ldquoItrsquos not an original observation but populism is offering people  solutions to real problems.ldquoPeople have a right to be angry. But the privatisation of their assets is a far bigger cause of the left-behindness that a lot of people experience than membership of the European Union.How did the EU end up being the focus of anger of those who suffered after the crash ldquoPeople have been subjected to years of propaganda, Harvie says. ldquoNot from all of the media, butyou read a lot of the tabloid media, some of the biggest-selling papers in the UK, you would have a wildly distorted view of what the EU is and what it does.The Scottish Greens co-leader has had his disagreements with the EU.ldquoEurope has been bad at trying to connect with people about why membership of a greater union is a positive thing, he says. ldquoIf the UK behaved in anything like as modern and democratic manner as the EU, I might not even want to leave it.ldquoThe UK is riddled with anachronism and privilege and the embedded power of the City of London.After Johnsonrsquos prorogation gambit First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said independence is now ldquocompletely inevitable.Harvie is not so sure. ldquoNothing is completely inevitable. Hope is hardwork these days. I think itrsquos really encouraging that people are still willing to say Scotland does not need to be locked into a political landscape we donrsquot feel part of.Andindependence fails to materialise  ldquoIf it does not happen, we will see another wave of disillusionment and disengagement, of more people being left behind, Harvie reckons.ldquoOur job is to do our very best to make sure peoplersquos anger is channelled into something constructive, into something positive. Not to deny people have been failed but to identy who has failed them ndash the right wing.And this, for Scottish Greens, is where the Green New Deal comes in.

Its thrust: repurposing the public sector to make Scotland greener and fairer redirecting agricultural subsidies to help green farming and forestry using the embryonic Scottish National Investment Bank to support clean manufacturing.ldquoThere are things we can do right now, even within the constraints of the UK, to reconnect people with the power that comes from community, from local creativity, says Harvie.ldquoWe are human beings.

However, in a time of national crisis, and in the wake of the decision by Boris Johnson to shut down Parliament, all MPs must be heard. So,the Prime Minister is so confident that he can shut down Parliament, why wonrsquot he agree to let MPs vote on that proposal If he wonrsquot agree to a simple vote on whether no deal should happen, a proposal that has been roundly defeated every single time it has been put to a vote in the House of Commons, then we will force his hand.

The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Traffic-calming measures will run in tandem with the part-time  zone outside Kintore Primary School\"  Councillors make policy change to improve Kintore School safetyviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said armed forces personnel make huge sacrices to keep us all safe\"  Aberdeenshire Council achieves gold award for work with armed forces, families, veterans and cadets viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"sinclairs sign up to support run garioch","story":"Sinclairs Jewellers of Inverurie has joined Dandara, Accord Energy, Ferguson Group, CPCo. and Thainstone Events to become Run Garioch#s latest main sponsor.As part of the family-run business’ th anniversary celebrations in , Sinclairs will be making a substantial contribution towards the cost of chip timing for the event that takes place on Sunday, March , next year.

Driven by my interest in social and environmental justice, I have been pleased to secure a number of concessions and legislative changes to improve the lives of people in the region.“At this time, I’m focused on working with others to secure the passage of my Member’s Bill giving children equal protection from assault and hope to see it become law in the near future.“The Climate Emergency our planet is facing means that, more than ever, Green policies are required. I know there are others who can ensure they are promoted, and delivered, for my home, the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat. It is a world-leading mobile solution for policing. It was developed here in Scotland in partnership with the police service, so it is fantastic to see that it will become available to , Police Scotland officers.“We look forward to working with Police Scotland and are proud to be part of this major milestone in mobile police technology.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the past, lsquooutstandingrsquo judgments have been largely data driven. ldquoThis resulted in the situation that we have now, where an outstanding judgement can be as much a reflection of the wealth of the community served as the quality of education provided by the school. ldquoIt is hard to see how inspectors will be able to make better, more trusted and consistent judgements of excellence in the system.The announcement comes after billions of pounds were pledged to Englandrsquos schools after years of lobbying by heads and teachers for more money.The Government announced money will be invested in primary and secondary schools over the next three years.Downing Street said the investment delivers on Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos pledge to increase school funding by pound. billion above inflation.The overall schools budget is due to rise to pound. billion in  , the Government said.copy -.

In the afternoon, of course, Tarantino#s latest, which I#d marked down as a #marquee event# in my own head having completed thorough due diligence on the Rotten Tomatoes film site.Careful planning went into this operation. First off, cinema times had to be checked, with the .pm showing being selected to minimise the risk of other folk turning up. As the French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre once said, “Hell is other People” – reportedly after going to a night time showing of Fast and Furious at the Odeon Cinema in the Fe Retail Park – so I was leaving nothing to chance. Jean Paul knew his onions.Next up, a quarter of Sports Mixture and a can of diet coke were purchased from the local ice-cream shop, the original Sports Mixture not the softer version, with the black liquorice slotting into the number ten role behind the main strikers. After paying a very reasonable £. for a premium seat and saving myself around £ on Pick’n’Mix, I sat through  minutes of adverts, paralysed with fear at the thought of a nacho-munching couple, armed to the teeth with buckets of fat coke, deciding to sit within, or on the fringes of, the five row exclusion-zone I’d created. Thoughts of Thatcher and the Belgrano were put to one side and three trips to the lavvy later, my pee-game was tight and I settled in for the feature presentation. The only downer was that I’d eaten all the Sports Mixture and drank the diet coke before the start but I got over the crushing sense of disappointment and made a mental note to “keep some sweets for the film in future”.The movie itself was bang average but it had Brad Pitt in it so the time passed smoothly enough, evenTarantino forgot to include a script – there’s an hour where nothing very much happens – and the ending is ridiculous.Cheers for that Barry Norman – Film  beckons. This got me thinking about great movie stars and how they dfer from other actors who mostly ply their trade on television and in the theatre. It’s not spoken about as much these days, and “star vehicle” seems like an old-fashioned term, but leading men like Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio can pretty much carry any film to success at the box office. Two things are required: a they have to be exceptionally good looking and b we can’t know, or at least remember, too much about their personal lives.Acting ability is important but the real greats understand that doing as little as possible on screen while maintaining a stillness works best. Brando knew this and was lauded for it even when the film was a bit ropey. Of course, I’m talking exclusively about men here.Things are still much harder for women actors despite the #MeToo movement attacking the Hollywood casting system. The term “leading lady” to complement the male star is hopefully redundant but there are still fewer opportunities for women to look cool and very few are given the chance to have their names appear above the title. Jodie Foster and Meryl Streep are the only two female actors I can think of in the last  years who have rivalled male stars in terms of box-office power. Things only appear to be getting better – sure, there are lots of great actors out there like Emma Stone and Kristen Stewart, but no-one yet has the clout of a Foster or a Streep. Perhaps they never will and those days are gone, with a slew of female actors doomed to stay at the same, albeit top, level, having to compete for parts.One of the things I like about Brad Pitt is that he seems fairly normal. You don’t hear horror stories about him being dficult to work with and I imagine he’s the sort of person who doesn’t order off-menu when he goes out to eat. No egg white omelettes for him.I’d like to think he likes a medium-rare steak with chips, or French fries as he probably calls them, and isn’t on a constant diet like most actors – but I’m probably being too kind. I do know he was married to that nice Rachel from Friends, then cheated on her with Angelina Jolie, married her, then got orced again and now has  kids to look after, but that’s no dferent from wee Bert who drives the fish van in Lochgelly. No doubt Brad has made a few stinkers in his time, Troy and The Devil’s Own where he played an “Oirish” republican terrorist to name two, but his movie choices in the last few years have been pretty much flawless and his IMDb filmography ranks among the best. This talk of choices brings me onto the tricky subject of Robert De Niro, or Bobby as I like to call him.His choices have been dreadful for well over ten years now and he’s in danger of ruining his legacy. I’m not loving the stuff he did for Warburtons bagels and the new Kia Niro car advert with a “hilarious” play on his name is downright painful, which makes me questionhe ever was making his own choices on scripts. I know some people don’t mind these shameless earners, and obviously he still gets a pass because he’s Bobby, but it’s hard to watch his classics knowing how the movie of his le has panned out. It’s getting to be like he’s a character out of one of his own films – a down at heel Jake la Motta, or worse still, wannabe comedian Rupert Pupkin from Martin Scorsese classic The King of Comedy. Who knows, maybe his best mate Scorsese has rode in again to save the day with the forthcoming The Irishman... but I wouldn’t bet a quarter of Sports Mixture on it.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dani garavelli one less role model for women in politics","story":"Regular readers of my column will know I have never had much time for Ruth Davidson. I didn#t buy into the #dferent type of Tory# shtick. All I saw was a woman who was photo opportunity-heavy and policy-lite, and who passed up every chance she had to be an ally to her sisters. I didn’t trust what she said and I hated the wayshe fought the SNP on key policies such as the Named Person clause. Still, there was no schadenfreude – and certainly no smugness to be derived from her tearful resignation as Scottish Conservative leader last week. Coming  hours after Boris Johnson stuck two fingers up at democracy, there was only a sense that we were losing one of the few Tories that had spoken out against him. Everything is relative and, next to the great buffoon, she proved less objectionable. Also, she seemed to have had the stuffing knocked out of her by the conflicting responsibilities of motherhood and public office and by the absence of moral leadership at the top of her party. All the bombast had been drained from her, as it has been drained from many of us by the political events of the past three years and who would take pleasure from that  On one level, the motives for her departure are a complicated mix of the personal and the political but, on another, the explanation is very simple. Isn’t she, like everyone , reflecting on how little power she has to change the current situation and asking: “What’s the bloody point ” There is nonetheless a lot to unpack in her short resignation speech and in the conversation it has provoked. Let’s start with her expression of that gnawing anguish permanently in the pit of many working women’s stomachs: that they are failing in every aspect of their lives that, however hard they try, they will never be good enough. “I fear that having tried to be a good leader over the years, I have proved a poor daughter, sister, partner and friend,” she said, tugging at the heart strings of anyone, male or female, who has ever felt the same. Perhaps this internalised sense of failure comes from women constantly being judged on their behaviour. Since Davidson made the announcement she has been criticised as “letting down” other working mothers by opting out – asshe wasn’t still holding down a full-time job as an MSP and asthe point of feminism isn’t to enable and support women to work or not to work, as they see fit. Given the intensity of the debate it has provoked, Davidson’s resignation speech requires close scrutiny. Was she really suggesting that, in , it is impossible for women to successfully hold down high-flying jobs while raising children  Or was she merely pointing out that it’s still tough and that, because it’s tough, there has to be a worthwhile objective  Certainly, things have improved for working mothers since I had my babies in the late s early s. Increased maternity rights, including shared parental leave, ought, at least in principle, to make it easier to juggle a career and children. But mostly women are still expected to shoulder the bulk of the emotional responsibility. They impose those expectations on themselves, which is why, I think, it makes little dference that Davidson’s partner is also a woman. Then, just as the children become more self-sufficient there are elderly parents to think about. You have to be committed to thole the stress of expressing milk, of leaking through your blouse, of shaking a crying toddler from your leg at the nursery door so you can make a meeting on time. Many women are prepared to miss their baby’s first steps to do a job they find fulfilling. But why would Davidson spend the early years of her son Finn’s le to campaign for the prospective re-election of a government whose goals she no longer shares  What would she tell him in later le  “I wasn’t around much when you were wee because I was pounding the pavements for Boris Johnson” My sympathy for Davidson is not unconfined it would be greater , for example, she had shown any regard for mothers, particularly single mothers, during her time as leader. Instead she voted for welfare reforms which left many below the poverty line, and failed to speak out against the rape clause which requires women to prove their third child is the product of sexual assaultthey want to receive tax credits for them. I hope in time she comes to regret this legacy. She should, in my opinion, have been more direct in her criticism of Boris Johnson and his prorogation of parliament – an act she certainly opposes. And she ought to recognise how lucky she is to be able to make this choice. There are many other womenwho are forced to work several jobs just to get by. The resurgence of the Scottish Tories caused me nothing but dismay. Without Davidson – their great white hope – at the helm, they are neutered, their chances of making an impact at the next Scottish parliamentary elections severely reduced. Davidson was also the single strongest voice in defence of the Union, so logically the chances of a Yes vote in a future indyref must also be increased. And yet, I find it hard to celebrate Davidson’s departure. Though never one for female solidarity, she was part of a bright, new political landscape in which women were, at last, to the fore. Like Kezia Dugdale, she has been pushed out by the political manoeuvrings of a man less able than she is and is likely to be replaced by the same. And who knowsNicola Sturgeon will survive another year. At the last Holyrood election, three of the five main parties were led by women by , it could be none. No visible female role models at the top of politics will make it less likely women will come forward to stand as MPs, MSPs or councillors. There is the potential, though, for her resignation to drive change. Last week, it opened up a fresh conversation about work and family le about how women can be helped to stay in top jobsand how the cultural sht from “motherhood” to “parenthood”, currently little more than a hope, can become a widespread reality in people’s lives. On social media, commentators were proffering innovations: a universal basic income for one adult in every household with a child under seven, for example, so the parents would have more professional options.

But,this conversation can be sustainedit provokes more frank discussion about the choices open to women, the pressures on them and the demands of parenthood and politics, it will have served a purpose.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"we must hold our nerve amid turbulent times john mclellan","story":"Ruth Davidson#s departure raises questions about a London-Scotland ide, writes John McLellanRuth Davidson wouldn’t have got baby Finn down to sleep on Thursday night by the time several newspapers were preparing front pages speculating about the Scottish Conservatives breaking away from the UK party to create some sort of Quebec-Baia-Ruritania arrangement or whatever it might be.Although the precise timing and the handover procedures were not finalised until early last week, those closest to her have known for some time that her resignation was coming, in all probability before the start of the new parliamentary session next week. There had been a possibility she would remain in post until a new leader was elected, but having done such a good job during her maternity leave and retaining his enthusiasm for stepping up to the plate, a caretaker arrangement under deputy leader Jackson Carlaw made sense as long as he was not one of the candidates as he had been in .Given the relationship with London was the key iding line between her and Murdo Fraser in that contest, it’s inevitable that it will be raised again against the background of the  per cent Remain vote in Scotland and the furore over No Deal. But while journalists are certainly entitled to ask the questions and for commentators to guess away, the number one question for the party’s senior elected representatives and officials is whether it serves their overarching interests to fuel that debate when so much  is uncertain Maybe discussing anything but Brexit is a happy distraction for some, but as the preservation of the United Kingdom remains the absolute priority for Scottish Conservatives the response to the question should be another question to what extent would separating the party advance its interests when it is likely to be arguing for the maintenance of a much bigger union for the foreseeable future Insiders are already speculating that the contest could be a face-off between Adam Tomkins and Murdo Fraser, in which case a debate about a split could easily become not one ofbut how. And the reaction in the world beyond the party membership, will be “who cares ”Now the succession won’t be decided until the end of the year, no chance of a second independence referendum before the  Scottish elections but the strong probability of an election in early November, what matters is how the party responds to unfolding events.As Ruth’s leadership moved into its final phase after her triumphantat the Scottish party conference in May, events in London dictated that the focus in Scotland would be on how she played the UK leadership election and the fast-changing Brexit situation. Apart from resolutely backing Anyone But Boris, it was her equally resolute opposition to No Deal which was clearly storing up problems and from the outside it seemed like she was needlessly boxing herself into a corner.There was an opportunity to use the summer to pivot away to a new position behind the direction of the UK Government, one which recognised that successful negotiations with the EU to find a new deal she would support relied on the possibility of a No Deal Brexit and an absolute deadline.As someone who always valued loyalty, she would fully appreciate the need for the Scottish leader to support the national position – and she had abandoned her opposition to more devolution for the Scottish Parliament when it was expedient to do so – it looked to me like she was laying the foundations for her own exit. After eight years of arguing, debating, negotiating, manoeuvring, leafleting, canvassing , fund-raising dinners far from home and, of course, the abuse, with priorities changed utterly by the arrival of her son her heart wasn’t in it.That her loyal resignation speech was graceful in the true sense of the word and supportive of Mr Johnson, suggested she recognises the opportunity is there, but it is up to someone  to take it. Polling estimates put support for Brexit in Scotland at over a million, which is a million voters who now have nowhere to go except the Conservative Party. Yes, many of them are right-of-centre Nationalists, but they are people who are willing to put their opposition to the UK on hold while the ties with Brussels are loosened and will not vote SNP while its clear policy is to take Scotland straight back into the EU.The Shetland by-election result demonstrated that although the SNP threw the kitchen sink and all other available appliances at the campaign and increased its vote share by . per cent, the Lib Dems still held on by nearly , votes. The real story of the night was Labour’s miserable sixth place. The once all-conquering people’s party managed just  votes, down from  in  and putting it in Monster Raving Loony Party territory. Admittedly the Conservative vote was only , but that was an increase of  on  when the Ruth Davidson factor was at full strength and the woefully dispiriting May years were yet to come. But with a seemingly unpopular prime minister, the proroguing of Parliament and the announcement of the popular Scottish leader’s resignation, the Conservative vote went up. And yet senior Scottish party figures are saying the only way forward is a new party  OK, Shetland is not a normal seat and the electorate is small, but such up-to-date evidence as we have suggests otherwise.As Ruth said on the eve of the  referendum, Scottish Conservatives have got to hold their nerve. After three years in which the Commons has singularly failed to come up with anything other than opposition to everything, Prime Minister Johnson’s cutting of the Gordian Knot, as he might put it, to slash the parliamentary timetable is a dramatic but legal means to bring matters to a head. Remainer ultras like Speaker John Bercow have twisted convention and procedure to their own advantage and are squealing like suckling pigs now they are on the end of a similar approach.I may be wrong, but the unwillingness of Lord Doherty in the Court of Session yesterday to grant an interim interdict before a hearing on Tuesday suggests the courts will rule the suspension of parliament is a legitimate political move and not a matter for judicial intervention. This is the Brexit endgame and the playing field will be that little bit more level come November.“There’s a lot to be said for strong leadership,” said a senior political figure to me recently in very hushed tones, followed quickly by “and that was off the record.” Because that person was an ex-Labour cabinet minister.Conservatives and Unionists just need to keep the heid.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Matt Aumlkerfeldt worked as Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’sstand in and body double from  to the show’s grand end this year. Caution - Contains spoilersyou haven’t watched the final season yet!Matt applied to be an extra on the show when it first came to Northern Ireland then ended up landing a full on role.“I did a few days of extra work and then got noticed by the casting staff as I bore a resemblance to Nikolaj, who played Jamie Lannister.“Most of my measurements were the same as him, down to even my hand size which was vital from season three as Jamie has his hand cut off. “I worked about  days a year on the show and then during season eight I was there pretty much every day!”In ‘real le’, Matt, who is , loves working in the Fairhill branch of Cafe Nero’s.  Born in Sweden, Matt moved to Northern Ireland when he was a child with his mum. He has adopted the Ballymena area as his home and says Game of Thrones helped keep him here. He explained: “I would get in before all the other cast and crew and have a rough idea of what scenes were going to be shot that day. I’d then go over them with the director and the camera guys plus the director of photography.“I’d be given some direction and then take part in crew rehearsals. After this would be the full rehearsal with all the extras, so by the time the main cast come on set I’ve probably gone through the scene about  times!“Nikolaj would then come on and get some short notes from the director before I’d also give him notes as I’ve already ran the scene. My face is never actually recorded on camera but I’ve been in every one of his scenes. “Working then as a body double was dferent. When doing this I dressed up in the character of Jamie and picked up the shots.“This even applied to the nude scenes, which I was comfortable with as I’m not really a shy person and don’t get nervous easily!”Although it would be practically impossible to tell the dference between Matt and Nikolaj on screen, Matt said: “I know all the scenes I did and,anything, it’s a bit illusion breaking as I also know what’s behind the scene!”So what was Matt’s favourite moment from the whole Game of Thrones season  His answer was the iconic trial of Jamie Lannister in Season .“All the main cast were together,” Matt explained.“On that day Nikolaj got wrapped early so when he’s not on screen all the actors are actually looking at me and I was delivering his lines to them. “I had this amazing line up of actors looking at me. It was a big moment in the whole series and I suppose I was relatively nervous!“When action is called, it’s like your le stops, you’re no longer in this world you feel you’re actually in Westeros. Then when cut is called everyone is back to normal. It’s amazingnot a little weird!”Being a body double meant that Matt wore the original costumes.“I wore Nikolaj’s costume alot, including the armour which is real.“I had to keep my body a certain shape so as to fit it plus I did have to keep pretty fit to carry it.“When we started working with the gold hand, my own arm was strapped behind my back, which was pretty uncomfortable, but the fake arm was amazing. It looked very real, down to the pours and hair on the skin.”It’s no secret that the last season of Game of Thrones was surrounded in secrecy! So how did Matt handle keeping the secret that almost  million people wanted to know He revealed: “I certainly didn’t tell too many people!“For nine years I kept all the secrets of the show and, especially in the last season it really was such a burden as there were so many consperies. It became hard to not talk about it and I really just wanted to tell someone about it.”Many of the ludicrous rumours about how the show would end were indeed , however Matt did confirm that scripts were destroyed after each scene was filmed.He said: “There were hundreds of people in the crew during the last season so it got to the point that sets were closed.“There was also misinformation circulated. One part of the crew would be told a certain detail about a scene or filming while another would be told something , all just to throw people off the scent of what was really going on.  “On one occasion Nikolaj went to Seville just so as people would think he was filming there when infact he wasn’t.”Final EpisodeThe final episode and season was met with much acclaim but it wasn’t without some negative reviews. Many people thought the ending wasn’t as dramatic as should have been, and some were left disappointed.To a certain extent, Matt agrees.“I think there was alot of character progression over the years that was forgotten about or pushed aside during the final season, and perhaps some characters could have had a more gloried end. “Perhaps the writers were concentrating on dferent projects. “My view was that this was the last season, we should have gone all out!”On Jamie’s last scene, where he died under a pile of rubble in the arms of his sister, Matt has his own philosophy.“In my head I’d like to think that Jamie was actually going to kill Cersei so as he could have a proper future with Brienne of Tarth.”Matt talks fondly of all the cast members, especially Nikolaj.He said: “I love Nikolaj. I obviously spent alot of time with him and I went to the wrap party which was great too.Gwendoline Christie, who played Brienne of Tarth was a lovely lady and I was friends with Jacob Anderson who played Greyworm. I got to know everyone well and generally everyone was really nice.” Le after Game of ThronesThe future is certainly bright for Matt as he aspires to get more recognised as an actor.“Currently I’m working at the Game of Thrones exhibition in Belfast and doing some photography work.“I’ve started a series of YouTube videos going round the Thrones locations in Northern Ireland and explaining them.“I recently did a video from Cushendun caves, which is special to me as it’s actually where Nikolaj and I had our last scene together.“From that I was noticed by a writer, currently writing a movie and was sent the script. So I potentially have the opportunity to be part of the main cast for that upcoming movie. “I don’t have an agent as I need a showreel of me infront of the camera, sothis movie works out I’ll get the showreel then hopefully an agent and we’ll see where it goes from there.“I also really want to keep my job in Nero’s as I love it there!”Looking back, Matt had such a great experience working on Thrones.“It was a great nine years! But when it all aired and all the secrets were out I felt really free. It was like a car had been lted off my shoulders as there was so much information I had to keep to myself!”Matt still hasn’t watched the final season on TV.“I still miss it as it was better than anything I’ve worked on before but I’ll watch it at some point, I know what happens at the end of the day!” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2228521.jpg--.jpg?1567156924000\n","title":"j p corry site re opens","story":"Local builders’ merchants, JP Corry, officially reopened its’ Ballymenabranch on Monday th August following a devastating fire that closed the site just  weeks ago.

However, he says that he hopes his run will raise awareness of mental health issues and suicide.“I’ve done several charitable runs in the past, but my main inspiration has been kids who have a certain condition and affliction and their parents seem quite helpless,” he explains.“I felt I couldn’t really help them in any way, so the only thing I could think of was to run to raise money for the charities that help them. I hate running, but it’s the only way I could help – I can’t do anything like a doctor would do or a counsellor would do.“Unfortunately depression, anxiety, suicide and mental health issues are getting worse in Northern Ireland, especially around West Belfast and North Belfast, which is really, really sad. For many people they don’t feel like they can talk to anyone or that they can speak up, because there’s still a lot of stigma attached to it, which is wrong. “We all go through issues, we all have problems – others might be better able to deal with them men in particular struggle to open up, but we all need to offload. If you have a toothache you’ll go to the dentist before it falls out,you have a sore leg you’ll go to the doctor before it breaks, but people ignore every sign from their minds that they need help. “It will help you in the long run and there is help available. There are charities that do it for free and they offer an amazing service. I myself have availed of it. I went to see a counsellor when I was having a tough time of it, and somebody took me aside and said ‘you need help’ and I’m glad I did, otherwise I might have been more unfortunate. “Depression is indiscriminate, whether you’re rich or poor, young or old, it can affect everyone. It’s important to be sympathetic to someone in that situation, because it could be you, your best friend or family member that needs that help. Hopefully, this run will be able to raise more awareness about these issues.”"},{"url":null,"title":"eu ready for more brexit talks but uk needs new backstop plan simon coveney","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is no country that wants a deal more than Ireland.“We want to get a deal that manages a sensible Brexit, that moves us into a transition period that gives us time and space to work out a future relationship.“But that deal has to be based on the Withdrawal Agreement and it has to be consistent with that, andthe UK wants to remove an element of the Withdrawal Agreement they have to acknowledge that that causes problems and they have to propose alternatives that can solve those problems, certainly in the case of the backstop.”On Boris Johnson’s suggestion of negotiations for two days a week, Mr Coveney said: “I’m surehe wanted five days of negotiations a week, the EU would be okay with that.“Michel Barnier is there as the chief negotiator for that purpose, he has a team that’s ready to go.“We all want to get a deal but at the moment nothing credible has come from the British Government in the context of an alternative to the backstop.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mr Coveney said Michel Barnier and his team of Brexit negotiators are willing to dedicate their time to finding a deal “If that changes, great. We’ll look at it in Dublin but more importantly it can be the basis of a discussion in Brussels, but it’s got to be credible.“It can’t simply be this notion that ‘look we must have the backstop removed and we’ll solve this problem in the future negotiation, without any credible way of doing that’. That’s not going to fly and I think it’s important that we are all honest about that.“We have always saidthere are alternatives to the backstop that do the same job, then let’s hear them andwe can work out a deal on that basis, so be it.“But what we will not do in Ireland, and I believe there is strong solidarity across the EU on this, we will not allow a really important element of the Withdrawal Agreement to be removed – i.e. the backstop, which solves a dficult problem, albeit on a temporary basis – and for that to be replaced with something that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny and is simply a promise that we’ll do our best to solve the problem, but not explain how.“That is not an approach that either Ireland or the EU will support.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38454200.ece/81b3f/BINARY/Last_saturday_August_001.jpg","title":"reform of northern ireland laws raised at royal black institution last saturday demonstrations","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

murdered journalist Lyra McKee received a standing ovation as she followed in her footsteps to deliver a powerful talk at Stormont..pushThe author’s Ted talk about religious education and its impact on the mental health of young LGBT people was viewed thousands of time around the world following her death at the hands of dissident republicans in April.On Saturday, four and a half months after Ms McKee’s murder, her sister Nichola Corner delivered her own talk at the TedXStormont event at Parliament Buildings in Belfast.She used the tribute address to urge people to build on the outpouring of love witnessed after the killing to finally secure peace in Northern Ireland.Ms McKee, , was shot dead by the New IRA as she observed rioting in Londonderry.Mrs Corner stressed the need to reclaim the word “unity” from the dissident extremists responsible for the shooting in Derry’s Creggan area.“What really fires up my imagination is the potential, the potential of what we can achievewe continue to demonstrate our inherent inclusive nature, just as we did in the aftermath of Lyra’s murder,” she said. “There are forces outside of this room that seek to draw our attention away from what unites us, ironically using the word unity as their banner – and we can’t let that happen.“We must not let those who seek to separate us succeed, we must liberate ourselves once and for all from their threat and the threats of others like them to our peace.“We must reclaim the word unity for its rightful purpose.“Some people have lost sight of the true meaning, they don’t really understand what it means, because for me unity goes way beyond land, it goes way beyond nationalities and it goes beyond labels – to me unity is a feeling.We must not let those who seek to separate us succeed, we must liberate ourselves once and for all from their threat and the threats of others like them to our peaceNichola Corner“It’s a feeling that leads to the outpouring of love that we saw in the aftermath of Lyra’s murder.“Unity is what the world demonstrated in response to Lyra’s murder and we must continue to build upon it and we must embrace it as our way of le and build on the momentum that was harnessed in April to make sure that we have a peaceful world that we have imagined.”In front of a packed audience in the Great Hall of Parliament Buildings, Mrs Corner recollected how she watched with tears in her eyes as her sister delivered her Ted talk in .“Lyra McKee will never be able to enjoy the peace that was promised in , but we must make sure that her le was not in vain by securing peace as her lasting legacy,” she added.“I know we can do it, I know we can secure peace.“Every single thing begins in the imagination and it’s alive in mine now.“And we will remain united in the truest sense of

Mr Allister claims that each application may have cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds. He is seeking from Peter May, the permanent secretary in the Department of Justice, a list of the occasions on which Mr McCord has been granted civil legal aid, the subject of inidual proceedings, and the annual amount of legal aid spent on each.Currently, the annual cost of legal aid in Northern Ireland is more than £.m, and some £.m of this is spent on civil cases such as Mr McCords applications.There is no doubting his record as a campaigner. Acting almost single-handedly, he exposed the UVF terrorist gang in north Belfast that murdered his son Raymond jnr in .However, his current reinvention of himself as a legal champion of the Good Friday Agreement, and anything which challenges it, risks confusing the properly separate roles of the legislative branch and the judiciary.Indubitably, politicians decisions must always be reviewable by the courts. However, it should be a general principle that political decisions are taken by politicians, and that the courts become involved only as a last resort, when some fundamental principle becomes involved.Lord Sumption, a former Supreme Court Justice, underlined this in his BBC Reith lectures this year during which he claimed that the law - and especially the expanding human rights law - was filling the public space which was formerly the preserve of politicians. He argued that judges, and particularly those in the European Court of Human Rights, were exceeding their power by expanding the interpretation of human rights laws. He described this colourfully as \"mission creep\".Should politicians ultimately be answerable to the law  Absolutely. Are arguably frivolous applications, whose costs rise in inverse proportion to their likely success, the best way to do this  Absolutely not.Surely there is a more direct way to \"put manners\" on our political classes - it is called an election.We may get the opportunity to make known our displeasure with politicians sooner than we think -we have the courage to do so."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38454200.ece/81b3f/BINARY/Last_saturday_August_001.jpg","title":"royal black institution last saturday parade photos","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Many of these schools are completely dferent places now to when they were inspected, with changed cohorts of pupils and dferent staff teaching a dramatically dferent curriculum. This is clearly not in the interests of parents, pupils or schools.“In some places, the exemption has acted as a brake on educational improvement – we have heard from headteachers who have taken over previously outstanding schools and have faced considerable resistance to change from all quarters, for fear of disrupting the apparent winning formula it has meant that outstanding schools have not had that official, external validation of continued excellence, which has made it harder for parents to compare relative strengths when choosing a school for their child.“However, NAHT remains concerned that Ofsted are unable to make reliable judgements on how good a good school actually is. In the past, ‘outstanding’ judgments have been largely data driven. “This resulted in the situation that we have now, where an outstanding judgement can be as much a reflection of the wealth of the community served as the quality of education provided by the school. “It is hard to see how inspectors will be able to make better, more trusted and consistent judgements of excellence in the system.”The announcement comes after billions of pounds were pledged to England’s schools after years of lobbying by heads and teachers for more money.The Government announced money will be invested in primary and secondary schools over the next three years.Downing Street said the investment delivers on Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s pledge to increase school funding by £. billion above inflation.The overall schools budget is due to rise to £. billion in  , the Government said."},{"url":null,"title":"speaker bercow in open opposition to people who voted leave","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Parliament having time.“Parliament being respected by the Government of the day and indeed by the opposition.”"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say september","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Amongst the pupils at the house which was called Tanus, was a young Samuel Beckett who attended there between the age of five and nine.The school was located on the Leopardstown Road between Foxrock and Stillorgan and in his later years literally giant still recalled that the place had a big lawn where, between classes, he and his brother Frank would play with the other children.Also, whilst they were attending the school, the Beckett’s father acted as a surveyor for a new building that the Elsner’s had constructed at the end of their garden to act as a gymnasium.Having obviously inherited her father’s undoubted musical talent, Alex attended the Royal College of Music in London where she honed her contralto voice and on herto Ireland in  and took part in concerts with many of Dublin’s musical societies and remained an extremely popular choice for private recitals in the fashionable houses of the capital.Later in the s Alexandrina Elsner was travelling north to sing in Belfast and the North West as well. Amongst her first memorable appearances in Derry was a performance as a soloist at a St Columb’s Choral Union concert in February  and at another concert in October  at the city’s new Opera House on Carlisle Road.The stature of the appearance of Miss Elsner at Derry’s Opera House, which had opened in , should not be underestimated since there were very few venues of this stature in Ireland at the time that attracted only the top acts of the time. In fact, the Derry newspapers - the Standard, Derry Journal and Londonderry Sentinel lauded her as one of the most favoured performers of the local audiences.Renowned Italian opera companies regularly visited Derry to perform and such was the popularity of the city’s Opera House that late night train services for audiences were often laid on from Inishowen and in the city late evening tram services allowed audiences to travel more easily to the shows.When she married Abraham Stewart on June ,  Alex Elsner moved to Derry where she wasted no time in throwing herself into the cultural le of a city esteemed for not only for its love of music but its wealth of talent as well.Just two years after her arrival in her new home, Alexandrina had established the Londonderry Philharmonic Society and Londonderry Feis. The Feis, beginning as a single day event on April ,  eventually bloomed into a week-long festival of music and singing by the s and she herself took lead roles in the bi-annual performances of the Philharmonic Society.The budding impresario wisely took counsel from the organisers of the Feis Ceoilin her native city of Dublin and invited a representative to Derry to advise on how to establish a local version. As a result, Derry became the second place in Ireland to establish such a festival, beating Sligoand Belfastto the punch.Initially, there were just a few competitions – for church choirs, factory choirs, school choirs, drum and flute bands, brass bands and for solo singers as well as special medals for songs sung in Gaelic awarded by the Derry branch of the Gaelic League. The interest of budding competitors was immediately taken as the workers of the famed city shirt factories quickly scrambled to form choirs specically for the Feis.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn advance of the first year of competition, by February of  three of the factories established four choirs. Welch Margetson  Co and Hogg  Mitchell both entered a choir each, whilst the much larger workforce at Tillie  Henderson entered two choral groups.With the passing decades the Feis gained more and more competitors and its repertoire of competitions expanded as a result not just from all over Ireland but from Scotland and England as well. As its prestige also increased, many of Derry’s businesses were glad to be associated with its success and donated beautul gold and silver cups and medals. Bursary schemes for those intent in pursuing a professional le in music and singing also began.In , just a year after partition, another woman Mrs Edward HenryO’Doherty founded Feis Doire Colmcille along with Fr Joseph McGettigan. The Derry Feis centred more upon Irish music, dancing and singing but despite the obvious cultural dferences, competitors from the Catholic and Protestant communities competed in both feiseanna without exception.Alexandrina Stewarts devotion to the Londonderry Philharmonic Society was equal to her commitment to the feis. Apart from featuring her own distinguished performances, the concerts also featured many distinguished musical names from both London and Dublin.In an era long before manufactured television vehicles, the twice-yearly Derry concerts also attracted talent scouts from far and near seeking bookings for their concert halls and opera houses.And, a major talent was spotted as the result of the Philharmonic Society’s concert in Derry on March , . James Johnston, a native of Belfast was well-known as an amateur singer in his younger days but was practically untrained at the highest level. Instead he concentrated as a career in butchery in his father’s shop and supplemented his income as a semi-professional singer at venues around Ireland.It was after his performance in Derry that he was snapped up by the Dublin Grand Opera Society and so began a huge career as an opera singer. It was after highly memorable performances in Rigoletto in Ireland’s capital in , the globally renowned theatrical director Tyrone Guthrie offered him a contract at Sadler’s Wells where he became principal tenor for well in excess of a decade.During his career Johnston played a wide range of roles which included his Covent Garden debut in La Traviata in  and also appeared with Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Johnston retired at the height of his fame in  and simply ed to working in the family butcher’s business in Belfast’s Sandy Row where he lived out the remainder of his le until he died aged  in .Johnston’s success however was entirely based on being spotted in Derry and to the efforts of Alex Stewart’s in establishing the city’s Philharmonic Society. It too sprang from relatively humble beginnings, with having just over  in the chorus and nineteen strong orchestra in . By the s the society accounted for  voices and a  strong orchestra that drew its membership from all classes across Derry.The pinnacle of Alex’s own musical career had perhaps come in March  when she was soloist for the celebrated Halle Orchestra at St Columb’s Hall. The orchestra had been founded in  in Manchester by Sir Charles Halle to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in January . The orchestra exists to this day and has been in residence at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester since .Abraham Stewart died suddenly in  and as a result, Alexandrina ed home to her family in Dublin, but ed to Derry every year without fail during feis week. The Feis Committee awarded her the honorary title of administrator and offered to pay the fare for herjourney for le.On May ,  Alex McCausland Elsner Stewart died at a nursing home in Dublin and her remains were brought to Derry and buried beside those of her husband in the city cemetery. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Her daughter, also called Alexandrina, had been killed just a few weeks previously whilst on active service in Burma during World War II.Abraham and Alexandrina had lived at the prestigious Crawford Square in Derry and it was there on April ,  that the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque marking her le and contribution to the cultural le of her adopted city.Commenting on the unveiling of the blue plaque, Chris Spurr from the Ulster History Circle said: “When Alexandrina Stewart embraced Ireland’s city of music, the result was a harmonious partnership founding the first Londonderry Philharmonic Society and the Derry Feis Ceoil.”CAPTION: The Londonderry Philharmonic Society on stage at the Guildhall."},{"url":null,"title":"nerve visual gallery close doors ebrington","story":"The Nerve Visual Gallery at Ebrington is set to close at the beginning of next month, the Derry News has learned.The announcement will come as a great disappointment to art lovers in the city who have frequented the gallery over the past number of years and will be a loss to the Ebrington site.When it first opened in  it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.However, at the weekend a spokesperson for The Executive Officeconfirmed: “The Nerve Centre has operated a gallery in a section of the Creative Hub Building   on the Ebrington Site for three years and gave notice that they intend to close the gallery on  September .“The Executive Office is currently considering options for the section occupied by Nerve Gallery.”Located in the former army barracks at Ebrington, the Nerve Centre developed a series of major visual arts commissions with partners including - Now, National Museums NI, The Fondation Gilles Caron, Gallery of Photography Dublin, Ultra Lab Madrid and Matts Gallery London.Exhibitions have shone a light on pivotal moments in Northern Ireland’s history such as the Civil Rights movement and the Troubles.The Lost Moment exhibition looked anew at the Civil Rights movement fty years on from the marches and peaceful protests that immediately preceded the Troubles. It featured dramatic images of the famous Selma to Montgomery civil rights march in , alongside work on the Northern Irish civil rights struggle, from the first march in August  to the Battle of the Bogside in .Picturing Derry brought together some of the most iconic images from the Troubles and the most recent exhibition explored anxieties around Brexit which were part of a series of cross-border projects.Local artists were also regularly showcased at the gallery.Earlier this year plans to build a whiskey distillery in Ebrington fell through.But last week positive news emerged of plans to build two Grade A office blocks and a -apartment retirement village at the Waterside site.The Nerve Centre was contacted for comment regarding the gallery’s closure but did not respond at the time of going to press.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

Work to widen Fountain Street to provide on-street parking and traffic calming measures has already been completed, while a pound, project at Collinsrsquo Corner is currently underway.Roads officials have previously suggested the introduction of a one-way system but little or nor progress appears to have been made on this particular scheme.While pleased with the work in Fountain Street and Collinsrsquo Corner, Cllr Curran believes they will not have a positive impact on town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with senior roads engineers. He is also concerned that no progress is being made to tackle a congestion and road safety issue at Edward Street in the town.His call for talks to discuss solutions to town centre congestion came ahead of a special meeting between councillors and roads officials last night when the Department of Infrastructure presented its annual report which details work that has already been completed on ious schemes and what projects are in the pipeline.Cllr Curran said the annual report contained no ldquoconcrete proposals for addressing town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with engineers.ldquoA proposed road between Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue has been shelved due to the cost involved and the minimal impact it would have on tackling congestion, he said. ldquoThat is why we need to get round the table and look at all options moving forward.ldquoCan lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking ldquoAll the key players need to get together as years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors.Cllr Curran says the time has come to ldquograsp the congestion nettle with the onus on roads officials to finally deliver by taking a critical look at the problems.ldquoWe need to take a critical look at the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. I suspect that the congestion issue that we have in Downpatrick would not be allowed to go unaddressed in any other major town in the country. We have had numerous reports on the way forward but what people, in particular those in the business community what to see, is action, he continued.ldquoDownpatrick councillors need to join forces and sit down with roads engineers to look at what can be done. Apart from the development of the Saul Way link road, there has been no major traffic development in Downpatrick town centre for decades.ldquoThe congestion problem is getting worse andthe ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station base and adjoining buildings are to be a success and attract new commercial and private development, we need to solve the traffic problem.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe congestion is driving shoppers out of the town and we need to arrest this decline. To achieve this, I believe that we need a brainstorming sessions to come up with a new blueprint on the way forward. There must be an end to a congestion problem blighting the local economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C August 28%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A young Ballynahinch familyrsquos seven-month ordeal ended yesterday mdash only hours after the Down Recorder took up their case.Thatrsquos how long the McGrory family have been waiting for a new fireplace in the living room of their Housing Executive house at Windmill Gardens.After such a long wait, workmen finally arrived out yesterday afternoon, less than  hours after the Recorder had contacted Housing Executive headquarters about the situation.The problems for the family started three years ago when their fireplace broke up. Housing Executive workmen carried out repairs, but seven months ago the fireplace again broke up. Since then repeated calls to the Executive met with little or no response.ldquoWith winter fast coming we needed this fireplace fixed, said Mr Terry McGrory. ldquoDuring the summer months we managed to make do, but therersquos no way we could face cold nights without a fire in our living room.ldquoSince February wersquove had to do without a fire and it was beginning to look like it wouldnrsquot be fixed at all. Wersquove called on the Housing Executive numerous times and used up all the repair forms at the back of our rent book, but still no-one had it fixed.Mrs Mildred Terry was equally unhappy. ldquoThe last time they came to fix the fireplace three years ago, they simply pushed it back against the wall and plastered it over the wallpaper which we had just put on, she said.ldquoIt became a big nuisance having to hope that friendly neighbours would help us wash our clothes and provide us with baths, because we were unable to heat our water by the use of the fire.BISHOPSCOURT mdash Police are investigating the circumstances leading to the death of an RAF sergeant at Bishopscourt last Tuesday evening.

Mrs Josephine King, on behalf of the people, presented Dr Moore with an inscribed watch and a cheque and Mrs Moore with an inscribed watch, while Miss Una Hardy presented Mrs Moore with a bouquet of flowers.Dr Moore thanked everyone for their generosity and stressed how much he had enjoyed practising in the Castlewellan area for so many years.SAINTFIELD mdash Residents beside a quarry near Saintfield who frequently had windows broken in their homes when blasting took place had their grievances aired at a recent meeting of Castlereagh Borough Council.A local councillor, Mr J A Lowe, raised complaints of householders whose windows are shattered by blasting at Lisdoonan Quarry.Mr Lowe said residents had suffered from broken windows and undue noise on many occasions. He wanted to knowplanning permission covered the size of explosives used in the quarry.He was told that  conditions were attached to the planning permission, covering such issues as the size of explosive charges and the permitted distance from the nearest dwellings.KILLYLEAGH mdash Work on a major housing redevelopment programme in Killyleagh is in danger of grinding to a halt. Speculation is mounting that the main contractors are getting ready to pull out because of unpaid bills by the Housing Executive.Ten houses which have been virtually complete for six months are still lying idle because minor sub-contract work has not been started. Ten families, who were told last December that new homes would be ready by February, are still waiting and the situation is fast becoming a deadlock.The poundm redevelopment scheme at Irish Street was to have been a Housing Executive showpiece. Work began on building  new homes in two phases in . The scheme had been designed to ldquoretain the character and charm of Killyleagh, transforming the old houses into modern housing for some  people.The Housing Executive have flatly refused to comment on the latest developments at the site and they will not go into the many complaints, except to admit that there are problems at the site.Three weeks ago a major row erupted all over the province when a dispute in the Executiversquos finance department caused a backlog of payments to dozens of small construction firms.DOWNPATRICK mdash A group of residents in the Flying Horse housing estate in Downpatrick are campaigning for proper dustbins to be provided.At present residents are supplied with paper bags which they say are too small and do not hold any great weight of refuse.

You could see smoke and a small bit of flames coming out of the car, I knew the engine was on fire.“Sean and I were straight over to him and told him he needed to get out of the car.

We got his stuff out of the car and popped the hood. “I phoned the fire brigade and Sean and I redirected traffic to keep them away from the car until they came.“The fire started to escalate, within I’d say about  seconds of popping the hood the engine was fully on fire.“Thankfully the fire brigade got there before the petrol tank went up.”Joshua guessed the man, whom they helped back to his house in the village with the items they helped rescue from the car, was in his fties or sixties. A video has been circulated on social media of part of the incident and praise has been heaped on Sean and Joshua for their brave actions.Joshua commented: “It happened so quickly, natural instincts took over. You couldn’t stand by and watch that. He needed help. He didn’t have a clue that his engine was on fire. If we hadn’t done anything he could have died.”Both Joshua and Sean play rugby at Banbridge RFC and are former students at Newbridge Integrated College. The boys will start Banbridge Tech next month.Sean’s mother Lisa commented: “They were very brave and I’m very proud of them, but it could’ve went terribly wrong just as quickly.The Mid Sussex streets

However he later confided in church leaders about the “struggle with my sexuality” and following “a huge psychological struggle that nearly killed me” he explained to them that he “would have to accept myself how God had made me or die”.He has since severed his connection with his original church but is now engaged with a number of LGBT affirming faith groups across Northern Ireland.A spokesman for the Church of Ireland said that a church Synod resolution on human sexuality in  affirmed that marriage is “a holy mystery in which one man and one woman become one flesh”. The resolution also opposed “bigotry, hurtful words or actions and demeaning or damaging language” in relation to sexuality. The spokesman said that church teaching is agreed in a “democratic” process Many clergy and laity disagree with church teaching “and may continue to hold their point of view, but it will not be the official position of the Church”.IRA victims dismayed by the re-appointment of Judith Thompson as NI victim commissioner Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article

That party said it had been giving her time to “do the right thing” over pensions .I understand that Lord Caine tried to block a re-appointment and advocated be a fresh competition for the victims’ post. Again the question arises: who now is advising Julian Smith  It doesn’t matter how smart an advisor isneither minister nor advisor has experience of the nationalist long game.The DFA would not let inexperienced Irish ministers be outwitted.Victims and proportionality are not at the heart of the legacy process, which seeks to keep the IRA on board and never challenges the implication that UK state, loyalist and republican are all culpable. For years I have written on this page about the moral collapse over terrorism. But outside of this paper’s legacy scandal series, and a handful of columnists for other publications such as Ruth Dudley Edwards, one travesty after another passes with little comment.Look at how another isolated voice, Trevor Ringland, who has spent a letime in reconciliation, has become increasingly blunt about the appeasement of terror. There has been much focus on the latter failings of Ms Thompspon’s tenure. Among the earlier things that happened under her watch was the time Martin McGuinness addressed a victims’ event and demanded full accountability of the UK state on the past.A man who orchestrated decades of bloodshed, and who was wholly secretive about ithad the nerve to tell an audience, that included people he helped make victims, that others must be frank.When we reported that grotesquerie, Professor John Brewer accused us of ‘conflict journalism’.Imagine a Parachute Regiment leader lecturing an audience including victims of state violence about how others must disclose.It is no surprise to me that the NIO did not conclude that a victims’ commissioner should be accepted by the largest category of victims. Had they done so, it would have upset nationalists.

But Brexit has shown that its ancient grievance about Britain is still alive.Of course it is reasonable for the Irish to be furious about Brexit. As it happens I always thought Brexit fraught with perils for unionists.But the prevailing high mindedness in Dublin, the complete lack of empathy with the confusions and struggles of its neighbour on a complex issue, Europe, that has caused plenty of confusion and ambivalence in Ireland too, the almost unison reaction of its media, which cheer leads its government , has reminded some of us that we want nothing to do with Irish unity.Yet there are endless references to a ‘new Ireland’ debate.Note that unionists and mainland Britons never harry Irish nationalists into participating in a ‘new UK’ debate, perhaps on what a post Brexit Britain might look like. It would be a stupid thing to try to impose such a debate on nationalists. So can nationalist Ireland please realise the same in reverse  Unionists do not want to give cover for ‘new’ packaging of an old idea, the unication of Ireland.Ben Lowry: The NIO above all is determined never, ever to upset Irish nationalismIt is telling that NI secretary felt unable to replace Thompson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: NIO is determined never to upset nationalists ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  People   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News People Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Opinion Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           People      \"  Reported  Years Ago : Latest on war planningFrom August   News Letter :  People,     .NI university on board for Mars missionA scientic project looking at wind flow at Magilligan Strand has led to an NI university getting involved with the Rover mission to Mars in .People,  .. and Colin Fearonwith Philip McNeill, Business Development Manager at Ulster Bank.\" title\"Edwardand Colin Fearonwith Philip McNeill, Business Development Manager at Ulster Bank.\"  and Colin Fearonwith Philip McNeill, Business Development Manager at Ulster Bank.\" New owners for Dromorecaravan businessBrothers Colin and Edward Fearon have announced the takeover of a caravan and touring vehicle sales business in Co.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted.

The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods. Linden Foods is now a joint venture and has entered the list at number  with sales of £.m. Another indicator of strong performance within the listing is that turnover figure required to gain access to the Ulster Business Top  is at its highest ever, with Heron Bros Ltd posting year end sales results for    of £.m. Last year’s number  was Cranswick Country Foodswith sales of £.m. This represents a rise in sales required of .%, to make the Top . Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time. The current tangible net worth of the Ulster Business Top  currently sits at £.bn – as the Top  listing is fluid with companies entering and leaving the list any comparison with previous listing can be distorted, however compared to the  listing tangible net worth has increased by £m. Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management. The shareholdersfor the Ulster Business Top  equates to profit tangible net worth and as a percentage sits at % The sales to equity ratio defined as turnover tangible net worth provides an indicator of how much money are generated by the business with each pound invested, for the current Top  this amounts to ..

Moy Park Ltd , Almac Group , Short Brothers PLC , Queen’s University , and Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companymake up the top five employers within the listing. Each employee within the Top  accounted for £, turnover – sales employee and accounted for £, profit – profit employee.

Breaking down the sectors As would be expected when looking at the line of business activity of the Top , both the wholesale retail and manufacturing sectors dominate, accounting for some  of the companies.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
