Huma Bhabha reveals how she sculpted her creation into life with cork and polystyreneShe has commanded the rooftop of New York’s politan Museum, and has exported her distressed sculptures around the world, but only now is the UK waking up to the work of Huma Bhabha. It’s not the first time she has been late to the party. “It took me a long time to get any recognition at all,” says the artist, who was into her 40s before she made her first sale. “But, when you get recognition much later, you have a lot of time to do whatever the hell you want, which leads to a better understanding of what your work is.”In the Yorkshire city of Wakefield, the destination for her first commissioned installation in the UK, shoppers seemed a little unsure what to make of the strange humanoid figure that is currently occupying of a stretch of pavement between the town hall and a first world war memorial. And it’s true that the two-tone bronze statue, commissioned as a centrepiece of the Yorkshire Sculpture International, looks oddly tentative, as if it has been beamed in from some intergalactic battlefield in an episode of Doctor Who and can’t quite believe where it has landed.Bhabha works in many media – from sculpture to drawing and photography – but, once you have seen her work, there is no mistaking it. Born in Pakistan, she has spent most of her adult life in the US, where she now lives in upstate New York with her artist husband Jason Fox and their two dogs. She is an obsessive snapper-up of abandoned objects and flits across cultures, drawing from science fiction movies as well as from ancient mythologies.At the Met, her two exhibits included an 18ft-long version of one of her best-known pieces, Benaam (Urdu for “unnamed”) – a prone figure that could be a veiled woman at prayer, and which she has used previously to memorialise the victims of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. “It’s about the endless wars and the endless killings of innocent people,” she says. Two years ago, the Tate became the first British national gallery to buy her work, investing in a 2006 cyclops head called A Man of No Importance.The Wakefield piece is titled Receiver, and though at first it appears to be a space traveller still plugged into its earphones, the closer you look, the more it begins to resemble an ancient Hindu icon washed ashore after centuries at sea. It is androgynous and faces both ways, with two pairs of arms, one down by its side, the other folded across its belly. “I like that it’s at a crossroads so it’s almost like a traveller, a receiver, with people driving, walking, stopping by,” says Bhabha. But no sooner had it settled into Wakefield than it (or, rather, an identical copy) popped up again in Regent’s Park, London, where it has a rather different vibe: as part of Frieze Sculpture 2019, it’s an exotic among exotics, which appears to have thrown a nearby monkey puzzle tree into a flailing tizzy with its badass reflection on the vulnerability of cork.For all that the figure is cast in bronze, Receiver was originally carved from cork and Styrofoam, hence its pitted brown legs and its strafed blue torso and head. Bhabha’s studio is full of found materials that might one day come in useful, and she is unafraid to capitalise on happy accidents. The Unnamed materialised out of a lump of clay and the black plastic sheet she was using to keep it moist and workable. A Man of No Importance is a mashup of materials including animal bones and a car headlight.She made her first cork sculpture in 2008. “There was a stationery store going out of business close by where I live,” she says. “He was an old man and the store had been around since the 1960s. He had these blocks that he would use for display. It was 10 to 15 dollars for a bunch of cork. So I bought it, though I didn’t know what I was going to do with it.”At the time she hadn’t done any carving, “so it lay around in my studio, and I thought the best thing to do was to glue the pieces together into a column and see if I could carve it. Then one thing led to another and he sold me all he had.” When her supplies of cork ran out it struck her that foam panels used for packing and insulation had some of the same qualities. “I realised they looked very good together, so I just kept doing it.”She’s reluctant to talk politics, preferring to allow her work to speak for itself. Receiver certainly fulfils Yorkshire curator Clare Lilley’s promise of “something bronze and distressed, referring to the turbulent world around us”. But there is also a pragmatic politics in Bhabha’s rescue of commonplace materials and abandoned objects, which is reflected in the siting of the piece in the city centre, far from any other exhibits. It stands close to Wakefield College, which is part of a collaboration between the Yorkshire sculpture festival and local schools and universities to get sculpture back into education after years of being sidelined because of the price of materials. This is a crossroads through which students pass, their heads encased in earphones like Receiver’s.Bhabha’s work is a demonstration that sculptural ambition doesn’t have to cost the Earth. Unusually in the world of monumental installations, she does all her work herself, only recently hiring an assistant to glue the blocks together. Receiver was cast in London, and she travelled there to distress the bronze further with bright daubs of paint that could be graffiti or tribal markings. “I’m not a purely conceptual artist. I’m a formalist and very much someone who works with my hands,” she says. “I’m not interested in putting objects together or illustrating a theory. I’m a traditional female artist. I’ve been making art for a decent amount of time and I like the fact that my work looks like my work.”Importantly, for the would-be sculptors of Wakefield and beyond, she is adept at playing with the illusion of grandeur: “I’m interested in the idea of monuments, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they have to be on a monumental scale.”• Huma Bhabha’s Receiver is outside County Hall, Wakefield, until 29 September and at Frieze Sculpture, Regent’s Park, London, until 6 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65a9a775753fe3d4963d01187665bc13ee1b784b/252_0_1425_855/master/1425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43ab0c24e39c9ac7eb5246197d05fb58","title":"the pioneering female photographer ida wyman in pictures","story":"The US documentarian has died aged 93.

It does require a certain level of concentration but that is a small price to pay (if any at all) for such a good book.It’s a rare book that moves me deeply, but even rarer than makes me cry, I’m ancient and male. Jokha Alharthi’s Celestial Bodies did just that. If the idea of a book about three sisters in practically medieval Oman in the 1970s sounds oppressive, it’s the opposite. Think of it more like an Ursula le Guin novel set in a dusty planet, it is that remote. The people are instantly recognisable, as they pursue love within a country in transition, one where slavery still exists. There is also a possible murder within the tale, a subtle strand amongst many. Plus an ideal beach read!I recently read and loved Emilia Pine’s Notes to Self, gobbled down in one sitting on a flight from London to Marseille. It made me realise that I very rarely read non-fiction these days, but I used to enjoy essay collections.Meanwhile, greenmill has just finished The Spy And The Traitor by Ben McIntyre:… having bought it on impulse during an airport departure lounge wait. Ripped through it in no time and even though I knew in advance how it turned out, the true story which is a jaw-dropping mix of narrowly avoided Armageddon, double dealing, death defying escapes and almost comical incompetence (mostly by the KGB) kept me turning the pages.

The immediate aftermath and also the years upon years that follow. It’s a heartbreaking and deeply uncomfortable read not for the faint of heart. This is challenging stuff!This Body’s Not Big Enough for Both Of Us by Edgar Cantero provides some good niche reading, according to pubbore:It’s a comedy thriller starring a private investigator who is actually two siblings in the same body, each controlling one hemisphere of the brain. I’m not sure if Cantero carries off the conceit entirely convincingly, but if you like gleefully tasteless violence and funny one-liners I can recommend it.Finally, Swelter has some tasty provocations from QD Leavis’ Fiction and the Reading Public:I’m enjoying it immensely. Leavis is a militant and unapologetic champion of the “highbrow”: ‘Those novels which have some pretensions to literary merit and can be criticised by serious standards (it is common even in literary circles to fling the epithet ‘highbrow’ at it).’In order to demonstrate the universality of the belief that, in the 1920s and 1930s, the most popular literature is invariably the worst, she quotes Arnold Bennett (Evening Standard July 19th, 1928):‘Nearly all bookish people are snobs, and especially the more enlightened among them. They are apt to assume that if a writer has immense circulation, if he is enjoyed by plain persons, and if he can fill several theatres at once, he cannot possibly be worth reading and merits only indifference and disdain.’Elsewhere she accuses Bennett’s literary column of being one of the forces, along with book-of-the-month clubs, that perpetuate and codify “middlebrow” literature.Nearly all bookish people are snobs? What kind of know-nothing would write that?If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Boeing’s top-selling plane, with around 5,000 on order worldwide, was pulled from service after an Ethiopian Airlines crash outside Addis Ababa in March that killed all 157 people on board. It was the 737 Max’s second disaster in five months, after 189 people were killed on a Lion Air flight in Indonesia in October.Elsewhere this week, it became clear that restoring trust among passengers could take longer than fixing the plane. In Washington, relatives of passengers who died in the Ethiopian disaster told Congressional hearings that Boeing had focused on profits “at the expense of human life”. In a blistering attack on the manufacturer and the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), Paul Njoroge, who lost five family members including his wife and three children in the crash, warned that, without change, “another plane will e to the ground, killing me, you”.Boeing released an initial $50m (£40m) in compensation for the bereaved on Wednesday, as part of a $100m fund it has set aside for victims’ families. The aerospace group also announced on Thursday it would take a $4.9bn charge reflecting the cost of compensation to airlines for schedule disruptions and a slowdown in production.Weeks of silence on the software issues at the centre of the crash investigations will worry airlines. Investigators are focusing on the 737 Max’s new anti-stall software, the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which was designed to keep the aircraft stable in flight. In both cases they suspect that the MCAS software – which automatically pushes the aircraft’s nose down to guard against a loss of lift – was activated by erroneous data from a single sensor. This forced the aircraft into es that the pilots, ultimately, could not stop.In the wake of the Lion Air crash in October, Boeing started work on a fix. But in late June, when Boeing and the FAA appeared to be reaching a conclusion, they instead revealed a second flaw had been discovered, beyond MCAS. It was another “potential source of uncommanded stabiliser motion”. Or, another way the plane’s computers might battle unwitting pilots in the cockpit, should it think its nose would be better pointing down.According to the global airline body, Iata, restoring the plane to service would take another five weeks from regulatory approval by the FAA. Boeing hopes to present its full bid for recertification in September, but the US carriers’ rescheduling moves show they do not envisage an immediate sign-off.Approval is likely to be checked by non-US regulators, virtually all of whom grounded the plane before the FAA. That schism caused profound concern in the aviation industry and the FAA is unlikely to go it alone now. Iata, which hosted a summit to urge regulators to align, warned that aviation relied on “mutual recognition, trust, and reciprocity among safety regulators ... Restoring public confidence demands it.”Retraining 737 Max pilots is another moot question. The Max was sold as an upgrade to the existing, bestselling 737, rather than as a new type: removing the expense of extra training, beyond a short iPad session. Many pilots doubt this was enough – redoubled since the Ethiopian crash, where flight crew had followed Boeing’s instructions and reminders after the Lion Air disaster. Should Boeing and the FAA decide it necessary to refer Max pilots to simulators – even as a confidence-restoring measure – further delays would ensue. This would hit early adopters such as Norwegian, who are deep in the red and desperate for the economies the Max would bring.Some have more radical suggestions. Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and former US presidential candidate, whose grand-niece Samya Stumo died in the Ethiopia crash, has demanded a full, transparent review of the aircraft before recertification. He says the review should be overseen by a public panel including victims’ families, pilots, cabin crew and mechanics, as well as the FAA experts.Some think the plane may never fly again – at least as the Max. Donald Trump has already tweeted a suggestion to change the name. Boeing executives at June’s Paris Air Show appeared to consider a rebrand, but the idea was slapped down by the boss. Chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said he did not “see the need”, adding: “This is not a marketing or branding exercise. Certainly it impacts the public view, but the most important thing is safety.”Yet a Ryanair Max 200 emerging from the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, this week had the designation “737-8200” on the nose cone, instead of the 737 Max seen on other planes. Who oversaw the paint job remains a mystery. Boeing indicated it was a question for Ryanair, but O’Leary later said it was “nothing to do with us ... We just put the names and a big Ryanair on them.”O’Leary does not anticipate customer concerns when the planes are certified and delivered, pointing to the example of the 787 Dreamliner. The 787 was temporarily grounded due to safety concerns in 2013 but is now popular with the public, he said. Likewise, the Max “will be warmly welcomed by passengers who fly on them”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78b3ea480ac45d505f5cce54ddb6978fe3f21002/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f9115a7babbf4e8f640f015313ad8ee","title":"london officials ban segregated play areas in future housing developments","story":"Exclusive: Move follows  report that social tenants were being banned from using facilities Segregated play spaces are to be banned in all future London housing developments, the Greater London Authority (GLA) has revealed this week.The policy, part of the London Plan for developers and local authorities across the city, follows outrage across the political spectrum at the case of the Lilian Baylis estate in Kennington.  Cities reported that families living in the social housing side of the estate were not allowed to use the play area or any communal spaces on the development.Henley Homes, the company that built the wall iding the estate, have since removed it and last week paid for a party for all residents to apologise for the segregation.Under the new policy developments, where there are a mix of tenures – private owners alongside “affordable” housing including shared ownership and social rented accommodation – developers will no longer be allowed to build play areas that are accessible only to people in the most expensive properties.Sadiq Khan told the  “it is disgraceful that children who live in the same development would ever be prevented from playing together”. He said he had told developers segregated development is morally unacceptable.“The policies in my draft new London Plan are absolutely clear that new developments should be inclusive to all. They are explicit that play space should never be segregated by tenure,” Khan added.Sian Berry, co-leader of the Green party, previously raised the issue of segregated spaces when she was a London Assembly member. She said the fight by women on the Lilian Baylis estate had sparked real change.“This is a campaign that has genuinely made a difference. It will have an impact that ripples through the decades,” she said. “People buying new housing should expect to rub shoulders with other Londoners of all kinds and their children should be able to play together. This makes it very clear how we expect builders and developers to protect our values as a city.”However, campaigners say the new policy has not fully resolved the problem because it will have no impact on estates that have already been built or are in development.In March the  was contacted by people across the UK reporting segregation on their estates.In Greenwich, families in social and affordable housing on the Seren Park Gardens estate have failed to gain access to a gated podium play space.The housing association, Moat Homes, argue the affected block is a separate development. It said in a statement: ‘They are separate developments and all residents … have access to the amenities within their particular developments.” However, the  has seen marketing and sales material describing the blocks as forming a single development and documents promising a play area as part of planning permission.When the  visited the site, Emma, a mother of three who lives in social rented accommodation, was bringing two toddlers out to play in the car park, 100 metres from the locked playground. Emma and her neighbours feel that the affordable homes were built to meet a target but then put in a separate building so they wouldn’t have to be given access to communal spaces.To get permission to build, developers must provide a certain percentage of affordable homes. All the accommodation in the block that does not have playground access is classed as affordable. The first five floors are social housing and the rest shared ownership, with buyers paying reduced rent to Moat Homes.Emma’s neighbour Rachael, who also brings her five-year-old and one-year-old out to play on their scooters among the cars, said the residents feel discriminated against and ask: “If that is their playground, then where is ours?”Alan Camp Architects, who won an Evening Standard award for best large mixed tenure development for their involvement in the site, refused to comment. Councillor Sizwe James, cabinet member for growth and strategic development at Greenwich council said councils did not have enough power to force access.James said: “When the development plans were submitted, the developer did not indicate that the amenity areas would be segregated, nor a gate placed at the entrance to the communal garden with fob access. We are very disappointed that residents are being excluded ... however, we do not have any powers to force the developers to allow them access.”Dinah Bornat is an architect who advises developers on child-friendly design and has been pushing for the London Plan to recognise the way children use space. She praised the focus on segregation by tenure as a starting point but said the increasing number of gated communities presents an ongoing problem.Bornat said: “Banning segregated playgrounds is dynamic, responsive planning by the GLA and will make a real difference. But we want developers to think about the impact that security fobs, gates and fences all have.“We have put boundaries and barriers in the way of children playing and meeting friends. It’s time to step up and ask is that what we want?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bc59a011949da45b3805b2aee398c5e6bec63b5/0_227_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3554f5e5f97b1d74c53568b9dbcdda6b","title":"the guardian view on moon landings a new race for space","story":"The Apollo 11 mission inspired the world. What has happened in the ensuing half-century?When Neil Armstrong stepped on to the moon 50 years ago, it was down to a giant leap of political and scientific imagination. His footprints on the powdery lunar surface changed the way we saw ourselves, confirming that humanity could escape its earthly coils. The mission unleashed a dream of what we as a species might do. Yet only a dozen people have walked on the moon, all between the summer of 1969 and the end of 1972.Did we lose our primordial urge to explore? Almost certainly not – though Buzz Aldrin this week decried “50 years of non-progress”, probes have travelled to Pluto and beyond. But times have changed. The cold war rivalry that catalysed the space race vanished. The Soviet Union was first with a satellite, dog and astronaut in space. Today Washington and Moscow play the great game in the Middle East, not the heavens, although both are now contemplating a return to the moon: Donald Trump wants to make America great again by putting astronauts there by 2024, though some think China may get there first Russia talks of landing cosmonauts by 2030.If Armstrong’s stroll produced the greatest broadcast in television history, then another astronaut produced the most significant image. The picture of the Earth rising above the moon’s horizon was pivotal for environmentalism, since it induced the sense that our home planet was something to be cared for rather than plundered. Underlying the idea of living on another planet is that we might need to if we continue making a mess of the one we have.However, the treaty that governs who can do what is even older than Armstrong’s steps on the moon. Private firms and smaller nations have joined the race for the stars. Luxembourg is positioning itself to be the centre of the space business. This will need careful handling.Space isn’t what it used to be. But one image of what happened on the way to the moon in 1969 needs challenging. In celebrating the lunar landing, let’s remember that it wasn’t only buzz-cut white men who had the right stuff: behind the scenes were female mathematicians, several of them African-American, tasked with plotting the route to the moon. Without them, Mr Armstrong would never have got there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25ffe681498ffc51cc8f54a030018c06a7e59e9/0_45_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f9c02598e0fb69417125a8d158bebb9","title":"woman breastfeed baby plane klm misogyny","story":"Well, I for one welcome the news: as of this week, anybody asked to cover up while breastfeeding on a KLM flight can now walk, bare-breasted, across the plane, milk firing into the air, their baby howling at their shoulder, and immediately hand that screaming, hungry, suffering child to the person who made the complaint, who must then look after that baby for the entirety of the journey while the previously breastfeeding passenger lies back, watches a film, reads their book, has a glass of wine or enjoys a much-needed nap.Because, my friends, that is precisely what I would do if someone asked me to cover myself while breastfeeding. This week, the Dutch airline KLM garnered a lactic tonne of deserved criticism after it put out a tweet stating that “to ensure that all our passengers of all backgrounds feel comfortable on board, we may request a mother to cover herself while breastfeeding, should other passengers be offended by this”. This was itself a response to one customer’s complaint, posted on Facebook, that she had been asked by a flight attendant to cover herself with a blanket – you know, like an actual fire – while breastfeeding her baby because someone else on the plane had complained.According to Islam, breastfeeding forgives you of all your minor sins. Here’s a hadith narrated by Ja’far al-Sadiq: “Every time a woman becomes pregnant, during the whole period of pregnancy she has the status of one who fasts, one who worships during the night, and one who fights for Allah with her life and possessions ... and when the period of breastfeeding the child is finished, one of the great angels of Allah taps her side and says: ‘Start your deeds afresh, for Allah has forgiven all your minor sins.’”In Judaism, the Shulchan Aruch (sometimes called the Book of Jewish Law) recommends breastfeeding for 24 months.In Hinduism, breastfeeding mothers like the goddess Parvati are found throughout the pantheon, and the ancient Sanskrit text Sushruta Samhita states: “May four oceans, full of milk, constantly abide in both your breasts, you blessed one, for the increase of the strength of the child!” So, let’s be clear: these customers of “all backgrounds” don’t appear to have any religious foundation for their squeamishness, fear, repulsion or anger. They are not speaking on behalf of any faith.Which means that what we’re talking about here is the old-fashioned culture of western, capitalist patriarchy under which a breast is often interpreted as something solely erotic, which must therefore only be visible jiggling nipple-free in music videos, or in its fetished entirety in pornography. Or perhaps we’re talking about the cultural background of angry men who find the very fleshy existence of anybody other than themselves an assault on their very soul. The sort of people who turn puce at the sight of a woman eating in public, speaking in anything louder than a whisper and otherwise taking up all that room they wanted for their own special man things.Or perhaps KLM is simply protecting the sensitivities of the sort of upstanding fellow passenger who drinks five whisky and cokes, scratches their crotch while watching their little telly, turns their headphones up high, doesn’t flush the plane toilet, pours a packet of cheese and onion crisps straight into their mouth, shouts across the aisle to call their friend Spuggie a “shirt-lifter”, leers at the flight attendant, pushes their knees into the seat in front of them and then, spotting a woman breastfeeding, decides that the smell of breastmilk is making their hangover worse.The fact is that cabin pressure within a plane sends babies into a frenzy of discomfort. While adults make be able to suck mints, chew gum or drink water, the roaring pain within an infant’s ear canal can only really be soothed by feeding – either from a bottle or a breast. With airport security as it is, those parents who can may well choose the simple, healthy and free option of breastfeeding while on a plane. The idea that some self-appointed moral arbiter can then go around the plane ordering a flight attendant to throw blankets over anybody they deem “unsuitable”, like patches of sick on a student corridor, would be laughable if it wasn’t so tiresomely bigoted.As passengers you have two options: respect the right of all parents to feed their child however they want or sit in a plane full of screaming babies and toddlers, strapped into seatbelts, disoriented, overstimulated and potentially scared, as the change of air pressure rips through their skulls like a drill. I know which I’d choose.• Nell Frizzell is a columnist and writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/548579d795ffcf95b321a07726aafee9fff16426/0_129_4016_2409/master/4016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73e1fd3a68dfddf44eebb59769b5705f","title":"trevor horn webchat post your questions now","story":"The 80s hitmaker and creative force behind the Buggles, the Art of Noise and many others will be answering your questions at 1pm BST on 23 JulyHe’s credited as the man who invented the 80s – or at least its sound, thanks to his early acquisition of a Fairlight sampler and a LinnDrum machine. Whoever else might lay claim to that title, Trevor Horn certainly predicted pop’s most visual era as half of the Buggles, with their massive 1979 hit Video Killed the Radio Star, and then capitalised on it in the decade to come.

He might as well have been the guy who invented the 90s, too: as part of the Art of Noise from 1983, Horn pioneered the sampling technology that would change the sound and scope of hip-hop in the years to come.His success continued through the 90s – Horn was behind Seal’s eponymous debut album – and into unexpected places in the early 2000s: ersatz Russian lesbians tATu’s English market debut, 200kmh in the Wrong Lane, contains three Horn productions, and is an underrated millennium-era classic.For better or worse (probably for better, to be fair), Lena Katina and Julia Volkova don’t appear on Horn’s most recent album, Trevor Horn Reimagines the Eighties, which employs Robbie Williams, Gabrielle Aplin, All Saints and Seal, among others, to do, well, exactly what it says on the tin.

Sometimes we haven’t got enough space in state special schools so more kids have to go to private special schools and so on, so we have got to make sure we have got the mix of provision right.”Hinds’ statement comes as county councils – most of them Conservative-led – say the additional support they have been required to find for high needs provision is cutting into other parts of their budget, while parliament’s education select committee has called for special needs funding for schools to be urgently boosted by £1.2bn.Hinds said the pressures on local authorities and schools have been emerging since the government’s 2014 reforms, which mandated support for children with education and health care plans (EHCP) and raised the age for support from 19 to 25.“Local authorities need to make sure there is the right setting for every child to help them develop to their fullest potential. There are a larger number of children getting EHCP statements and there have been other cost pressures on schools as well,” Hinds said.While the education secretary has also been lobbying the Treasury for an overall improvement in funding for schools in England, Hinds said it was well understood within the government that special needs was a top priority.“It’s about making sure we have the right amount of capital for state special schools and that we’ve got the right provision of inclusion facilities within mainstream schools, the right number of educational psychologists, there’s a whole range of things. But you need to fund it as well, you need the money that goes behind it,” Hinds said.“But these questions around high needs are really, really important. We passed the Children and Families Act in 2014, a really significant reform. That has resulted in more support for more children, which is a good thing, and there’s also more support for children after the age of 18. But it does need funding.”With a new party leader and prime minister in place next week, Hinds does not know if he will retain his post, but said: “I’d love to be able to carry on doing this job, it’s a great privilege.”The education secretary may exit as protests continue in Birmingham by parents and others over relationship education including LGBT being taught by schools. Hinds defended his department, which has been criticised for not giving schools firmer guidelines on relationships, sex and health education, leaving school leaders vulnerable to pressure from parents.“The idea that schools decide what they teach is not a new feature of the English education system. We have never, ever, specified exactly what you are going to cover in sex education and in what year,” Hinds said.“I think we’ve got that balance about right, we came up with a set of guidance that Stonewall welcomed and the Catholic education service welcomed. In the consultation we were in close contact with the Office of the Chief Rabbi and the Association of Muslim Schools as well as teaching unions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12da96b08b677e7f862d0dba73f9f5d0fbf9498d/0_128_1821_1093/master/1821.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58c7d150232b3078336addc428d1e6b1","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Firebugs in Russia, monkeys in India and penguin visitors in a New Zealand sushi shop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18fa6929f03e79198c616ca1df45173bbcc6ae1b/0_3_2846_1707/master/2846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05e554d82c4f3fbf1b601b053b8faa10","title":"cats trailer universal pictures andrew lloyd webber musical film adaptation","story":"Critics have savaged the first look at Tom Hooper’s Andrew Lloyd Webber film, yet an extreme response is catnip for a studio chasing audiences in the age of NetflixFew film trailers genuinely electrify the internet. Yet on Thursday night, first footage from Tom Hooper’s adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats did exactly that.Hooper’s film has long been fancied to repeat – or even better – the success of his Les Misérables, which won three Oscars and took £353m in 2012. And since Cats was first announced three years ago, anticipation has only mounted. A first-class cast was wrangled, including Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, Idris Elba and Taylor Swift. During the shoot, Swift excitedly revealed that she and her fellow actors were attending “cat school” to seem more feline. Reports of the pioneering “digital fur technology” that would be used in post-production were lapped up eagerly.But the collective hairball that met the trailer has readjusted expectations and rewritten the conversation – with the film’s special effects singled out for particular criticism (“That CGI looks like something my actual cat vomits up”). Viewers have queried the wisdom of transmogrified actors apparently retaining their own noses - and, in some cases, genitals. Dismayingly located tails added to the confusion, as did the cat-fur coat sported by Dench’s already hirsute Old Deuteronomy.Yet rather than licking its wounds, Universal Studios, which has sunk an estimated £230m into its big winter holiday release, is likely to be quietly purring. The film’s Oscar hopes may have been spayed, but its box office prospects rarely looked healthier. Aficionados of the stage show were already guaranteed to turn out in herds the catastrophe teased on Thursday means even people with a professed Cats allergy have had their appetites whetted. The film is now being billed as a must-see for the hate-watch crowd, who tend to head to cinemas en masse, on repeat and with a drink in their hand.And this is exactly the demographic targeted with increasing desperation not just by studios and distributors but multiplex owners and the chains that run their concession stalls. Two companies currently dominate cinema: Disney and Netflix. The latter keeps people indoors with so-so fare such as Bird Box and Murder Mystery. The former manages to coax them out by only making movies that demand to be seen on the big screen. Disney’s market share is currently more than a third and growing, thanks entirely to event cinema such as the Avengers movies and Star Wars, whose ninth episode will be Cats’ biggest competition this Christmas.Universal knows that a ticket is still a ticket even if it’s been bought by rubbernecker. And it’s not the only one. Earlier on Thursday, Paramount Pictures dropped the first look for Top Gun: Maverick, the belated Tom Cruise sequel, 34 years after the release of the original. Another prime cut of spectacle cinema, in which Paramount will have placed considerable hopes – and funds.But by Friday morning, there was little talk of Top Gun 2 – on Twitter, at least. The return of the biggest film star in the world to his most-loved role had been scorched by the sight of Judi Dench in whiskers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38c62ba0b40dedab7b8796e43e108e2e27e8ba2c/169_0_788_473/master/788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0566245fcad405ff92336b784b2ef572","title":"feline queasy 10 urgent questions about the cats trailer","story":"If you saw the Cats trailer last night, you won’t have slept and may still be shaking.

Soon, some other supposedly prestigious director will release a trailer for another terrible musical where the cast have been digitised to look nightmarish and half-formed, and you will move on.In the meantime, I have some questions about the Cats trailer.This shouldn’t be difficult. In TS Eliot’s poetry collection Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, the cats are the size of cats. In the stage musical Cats, the cats are the size of people. But here? It’s hard to know. In one shot, a cat just about fits into a standard dustbin (too big for a cat), another gets its paw stuck in a standard mousetrap (the correct size for a cat). Then there’s this shot, where an entire cat is roughly the size of a standard dining knife (too small for a cat, much too small for a cat). How the hell are audiences supposed to enjoy Cats if they’re constantly trying to discern scale, Tom Hooper?Did Dench specifically grow out her fur so that she could cut it off and make it into a coat for her to wear, even though that would be redundant because she was already wearing the fur? Or did she seek out a number of cats with identical fur to hers – maybe even her own relatives – and brutally skin them so she could wear them as a garment? Is Dame Judi Dench the Ed Gein of cats? Logically, it has to be one or the other.“Remember Catwoman? She’s sexy, right?”“Yes Tom, she’s sexy”.“Could we make our cats as sexy as Catwoman?”“I’m not sure that would work, Tom. Catwoman is a woman who simply assumes feline characteristics, whereas the cats in Cats are literally cats.”“I get it. It’s OK to want to have sex with Catwoman, because when she takes her clothes off she’s a naked human being. But it isn’t OK to want to have sex with a cat, because cats are already naked, and if they take their fur off then they’re just pulsating masses of blood and sinew?”“Nah, screw it, let’s give them tits anyway.”By now, Rebel Wilson has played the exact same character in about 300 films. The repetition of having to be the clumsy, too-confident, overweight comic relief again and again, no matter the film, must be exhausting. So she must have been thrilled to get a call to play a role in a tentpole film by the Oscar-winning director of Les Misérables. Except, oh, wait, no, she’s playing the exact same character in this as well. Still, at least this character is covered in a kind of harrowing woodland moss. That’s something, right?Finally, a question with an answer. James Corden did not vomit into another cat’s face. James Corden spat food into another cat’s face. I hope this helps.Jason Derulo, performer of hits like Swalla, Wiggle and That’s My Shhh? Jason Derulo, deliverer of the lyric “Is it weird that your bra reminds me of a Katy Perry song”? Jason Derulo, whose biggest screen role until now has been playing Ronald Dawson in one episode of the little-loved television adaptation of Lethal Weapon? Yes. That Jason Derulo.Hugely. Enormously. With every atom of her being. Hudson’s rendition of Memory in the Cats trailer – performed in the manner of someone standing on a motorway bridge trying to warn motorists of a cow in the road – is clearly meant to be this film’s answer to Anne Hathaway’s I Dreamed a Dream moment in Les Misérables. That performance won Hathaway an Oscar. However, that was because Hathaway was playing an orphaned sex worker who has to sell her own teeth to feed her daughter, set against the backdrop of France’s violent June Rebellion and not, say, a funny cat in a film about cats.Oh, that’s right, I’m involuntarily peeling the skin off them because apparently that sensation is preferable to looking at any more footage of screaming, digitally augmented, uncanny valley feline hell-mutants. This trailer made me vomit, and wet myself, and now I’m peeling the skin off my own hands. Are you happy now, Tom Hooper?• Cats is in cinemas in December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05ffcbe43ca256b5128c62b4fc4ad5c09fe31929/0_392_4291_2574/master/4291.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae77dcde3ecfbad9a7362201a5090e95","title":"cocktail of the week london cocktail clubs club tropicana recipe","story":"This Club Tropicana is free – of alcohol, at least – but the sultry smoothie is still packed full of party flavoursThis will wake you up before you go-go – Club Tropicana is more than just a song by Wham!

Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!Senegal, regular producers of remarkable players, have been champions of Africa exactly as many times as Djibouti, Andorra, Burnley, Richard Keys, Danny Mills and Weird Uncle Fiver. So when Senegalese fans look at their international trophy cabinet, all they see is Ali Dia’s gong for top b@ntz and a certified letter from El Hadji Diouf in which he confirms he is the greatest sportsman who ever lived. But all that could be spittle under the bridge if the Teranga Lions do the business in Cairo on Friday, when they take on Algeria in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations final.Algeria’s record in the tournament is only slightly better than that of their opponents: their only win was back in 1990, when, as it happens, they ousted Senegal in the semi-final. So if history has any role to play in this match, which only a fraud trying to fill space would claim it does, then it’s definitely in favour of Algeria, who have never lost to Senegal at that Afcon. They even beat Senegal earlier in this one, prevailing 1-0 in a group-stage clash after the referee interpreted a two-man take-down of Sadio Mané in the penalty box as a textbook tackle that would not even have Sir Harry Kane hitting the ground. If only the referee in Senegal’s last match had been as lenient, then Kalidou Koulibaly would not have been shown a yellow card when the ball ricocheted on to his helpless hand, leaving him suspended for Friday’s final.Senegal’s manager, Aliou Cissé, is undaunted and foresees his team ending years of hurt for his country. “Senegal has always had great players,” he lectured as Diouf passed around photocopies of rankings excreted by Pele in 2002. “This may not be the best ever generation but we have the desire.” But which team have the legs? Players from both sides have been locked into a sort of time-travel, still finishing last season while their clubs are well into preparations for the next one. “Both teams will be quite tired,” conceded Atal. “So I think the match is going to be played in the head. We are going to be lucky enough to have a lot of supporters there so may that will give us the boost we need to finish our adventure beautifully.”“I can only apologise to our fanbase for putting them through that.

Senegal and Algeria will contest the final but there is a feeling, at the end of a hastily arranged tournament that ided home supporters and saw their team fall short of expectations, that the past month is best swept under the carpet. The country sought political capital from extending the arm of help to its continent when Cameroon was stripped of hosting rights last year, but the gains have been hard to discern.“Nobody can deny the fact there’s a connection between politics and the organisation of this tournament,” said Ziad Akl, an analyst with the Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies. “The national discourse overshadowing this whole thing is that this is a matter of patriotism, not a matter of football.”The tournament has been a clear opportunity for Egypt: one that allows it to promote its soft power interests within Africa. “This connects to Egypt’s presidency of the African Union, how Egypt is trying to exhibit an image saying that it is the most capable country with sports infrastructure,” said Akl.Egypt also launched a new channel, TimeSport, that has allowed citizens to watch matches for free. The channel excuses them from paying fees to BeInSports, owned by rival nation Qatar. “Having a channel like TimeSport is one of the tools of political soft power that the regime is using right now throughout football,” said Akl.There has been a less open approach around the stadiums. Supporters were required to obtain a “Fan ID” before purchasing a ticket, a step up from already tight measures filtering fans who wanted to watch domestic matches since the stands were reopened last year. Getting a fan ID requires handing over a lot of personal data: all four names each Egyptian has, plus their mother’s name from their birth certificate, details of their jobs, a picture and a photo of their existing ID card.“This is something that logistically has never existed in the history of Egyptian audiences and stadiums,” said Akl. “You’re being evaluated according to your own data – it’s not about the fact you want a Fan ID, it’s about whether you qualify for one. You’d have to be someone who isn’t politicised.”The Fan ID requirement has allowed the Egyptian authorities to sift out anyone they believe might say or do anything political in the stands. Akl believes upper- and middle-class fans, those less likely to use football as an opportunity for political messages, are being targeted to fill stadiums. There have been quiet exceptions: in the 74th minute of every game, fans have held their phones aloft to commemorate the 74 victims of the Port Said tragedy, while similar scenes have occurred to mark the shirt number – 22 – of the exiled former superstar Mohamed Aboutrika. But they are low-key forms of protest that would require heavy-handedness to quash.Some visiting teams have played to largely empty stadiums. Akl said he knows an estimated 250 people who were refused tickets. “There are plenty who have been refused for no apparent reason, with no obvious affiliation, and there are games where it just doesn’t make sense that the tickets would be sold out,” he said. He added that some businesses have bought tickets in bulk since Egypt suffered a surprise exit against South Africa, offsetting a desire among local fans to treat the tournament as over.That has still hurt attendances during the knockout phase, although ticket prices have hardly helped. The cheapest access to the final costs $30, just under a quarter of the average monthly salary semi-final tickets cost a minimum of $18 and it is no surprise that Senegal v Tunisia and Algeria v Nigeria took place to swathes of empty seats. “What disappoints us is that the stadiums are a little empty,” the Senegal coach, Aliou Cissé, said. “Tomorrow we hope that the Egyptians, Algerians and Senegalese will be there to fill the stadium.”There is genuine concern they may not and, for a country eager to demonstrate its sporting fervour, the optics of more gaps in the stands would be terrible. In any case, Algeria’s supporters may have to practise caution. One, named locally as Samir Sardouk, was punished during the group stage for breaching the barrier between football and politics. He is believed to have been deported for holding a placard which translates as “they all must go!”, a slogan of the anti-government uprising that began this year in Algeria. He has since been jailed for a year in his home country.“As soon as they asked me for my passport I knew something was wrong,” one of his friends told the . “They almost kidnapped us from the stadium. After a few kilometres they dropped me and the second supporter off. As soon as we got out of the car, they told us not to cause any problems and drove away with Samir.” Sardouk was taken straight to El Harrach prison in Algeria upon returning, and subsequently sentenced.Egypt’s human rights record is difficult to ignore. As the tournament progressed, Egyptian authorities arrested at least eight leftist political figures in coordinated dawn raids. Friends suggested the group was targeted as they prepared to launch a political party to compete in next year’s parliamentary elections. A week later, Amnesty International released a report describing “unprecedented repression,” under the regime of Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.For domestic fans, Afcon was supposed to be a ray of sunshine that never really materialised. In July, Egypt raised fuel prices, an unpopular move that strains a population wearied by years of austerity measures. “The fact we were knocked out was unexpected and didn’t wield the expected outcome for the regime,” Akl said. Afcon was also supposed to bring in vital revenue. “There was an overestimation of financial gains,” said Akl.Now they hope that, with the world’s eyes on what should be a watchable final, a positive last impression brings at least some fond memories before everyone moves on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa4b2c1be4e2aa5073f495f0040ddd4897b423fe/110_0_1580_948/master/1580.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52f301e84ecc3feb158d06dabb353a58","title":"apollo women man walk on the moon","story":"Numerous unsung women, from computer engineers and mathematicians to secretaries and seamstresses, helped put a man on the moon. Here are the stories of some of those womenAll 12 people who walked on the moon were men. But among the 400,000 people who made it possible, there were numerous unsung women, from computer engineers and mathematicians to secretaries and seamstresses. Today, as America contemplates a return to the moon, there is resolve to ensure women aren’t in the background, but are instead the astronauts leading the way. Fifty years after Apollo, David Smith tells the stories of some of the women who helped put a man on the moon.A 21-year-old woman from Texas was responsible for making sure that Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins were prepared and in the right frame of mind to make history on the moon.Jamye Flowers, who had joined Nasa straight out of school, was Apollo 11’s crew secretary, a position that required a troubleshooting all-rounder willing to work long hours.According to the Smithsonian Institution’s Air \u0026amp Space magazine, “Coplin wrote their frequent travel orders, ran interference when outsiders wanted access, traveled with them to the Cape for launches, kept their wives informed, and even babysat their children. When changes were made to the flight checklist, she had enough technical knowledge to see that they were made correctly.”Flowers recalled visiting the launchpad at night when the Saturn V rocket was lit up. “We would try to make a good luck trip to get as close to the pad as we could, and just sit there and soak it all in and say a few little prayers for good flights and everything. That became a ritual for us to do that. I remember being out there that night on 11. It was exciting.”Margaret Hamilton grew up in the midwest and says it was her British father who taught her to ask “what if” and “why not”. She started her career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1959 but then got wind that Nasa was aiming for the moon. “The ad made it sound so exciting, I decided to go find out more about it,” she recalled in a recent interview with the .Hamilton became the lead programmer on the groundbreaking Apollo guidance computer, which had less capacity than today’s mobile phones, and worked on every crewed mission (she names Apollo 8 and Apollo 11 as particular favorites). She led the team that developed the inflight software for the command and lunar modules and came up with the idea to call her discipline “software engineering”.She was also a woman in a man’s world. “I didn’t even think about it at the time, but the culture was different,” she said at the headquarters of Draper, a Boston engineering company that received the Apollo program’s first major contract. “When I first got there I was the only one in that project. If you look at photos of the engineers back then, you can hardly find a woman in there.“People say, ‘Well, there were women’. Yeah, but they weren’t doing technical jobs,” she said. Hamilton, who often brought her daughter, Lauren, to work with her in the evenings and on weekends, recalled that as time went on, the women’s liberation movement asserted itself. “There was a whole thing that started, even at MIT, and they wanted only women around to join. I was curious because one of the people worked for me, and so I remember going and they were saying all these horrible things that men did.“Then they wanted me to speak up at this huge conference at MIT, to talk to the women I said, ‘Well, what about the men?’ ‘Oh, we’re not inviting them, this is only for women.’ I said, ‘If it’s only for women I’m not going to be in favour of another kind of discrimination.’ Either everybody’s involved or they’re not, and I didn’t give my talk because I thought it had to do with fairness for all.”Hamilton set up her own software company and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obama in 2016. Now 82, she uses email but does not have any social media accounts. She is encouraged by women’s advances in the workplace, and in space, but warns that a backlash is under way.“There are many problems in the culture today that are worse than yesterday because women are more of a threat to some people,” she added. “They weren’t a threat then they were an oddity. Because of social media and everything there’s a lot of good stuff and a lot of bad stuff. If the good stuff wins over then there’s hope. So how do we fight that? How do we make that work?”Future visitors to the moon can look for “Crater Poppy”, named after number cruncher Frances “Poppy” Northcutt.She went to the University of Texas and studied maths because, she once said, it would help her get “a man’s job”. She joined TRW Systems, an aerospace contractor that worked with Nasa on the Apollo program and designed and built the descent engine for the lunar lander.Northcutt was soon promoted, becoming the first female engineer to be part of mission control at Nasa. She worked alongside male colleagues to plan the trajectory for Apollo 8 to return to Earth. She was also involved in Apollo 11 and the epic struggle to bring Apollo 13 home after it got into trouble.“I felt a lot of pressure because I was the only woman,” she told PBS. “I started looking around at these dudes that were working with me and I thought, ‘You know, I’m as smart as they are.’”At one point she discovered one of Nasa’s internal channel cameras was focused entirely on her. She added: “I was sort of the trophy. I was blonde, I was young, I was thin, I wore the ladies’ fashion clothes.”But Northcutt learned to live with the attention. “Well, of course I was being used,” she told PBS. “My feeling was, you can play this both ways. The mere fact that a lot of women found out for the first time that there was a woman in mission control was a very big deal.”After Nasa, Northcutt became an outspoken feminist and, as the first “women’s advocate” in Houston, helped combat sex discrimination in the fire department. She went on to be a criminal defense lawyer and, now 74, is currently the president of the Texas chapter of the National Organization for Women.She endured obscene phone calls, lewd comments in the elevator and having to leave the building where she worked in search of a female bathroom.But on 16 July 1969, JoAnn Morgan was the only woman in the launch firing room for the Apollo 11 liftoff.A self-described “precocious little kid”, Morgan began working for Nasa in 1958 while still in college. The Nasa website recounts: “Morgan heard later from colleagues that when she was hired to join the team, her immediate supervisor, Jim White, called everyone for a meeting – except her. As the room filled with men, White explained to the crew:“‘This is a young lady who wants to be an engineer. You’re to treat her like an engineer. But she’s not your buddy. You call her Ms Hardin. You’re not to be familiar.’“‘Well, can we ask her to make coffee?’ someone asked.“‘No,’ White said. ‘You don’t ask an engineer to make coffee.’”It was therefore little surprise that Morgan usually got the overnight shift ahead of launches, making way for a male colleague a few hours before the grand spectacle.But when it came to the big one, she got her big break as instrumentation controller. Among the familiar rows of white short-sleeved shirts and dark ties, she is the solitary woman visible inside Nasa’s firing room for the launch of Apollo 11.She told the Nasa website: “It was just meant to be for me to be in the launching business. I’ve got rocket fuel in my blood.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80a82b704bc0ca50e541dc0ebf4efe267bee46e7/296_180_3116_1870/master/3116.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14d01c1fda41595729f7de092b6177fd","title":"what your friendships say about you brits have few friends","story":"British people have fewer close friends than other nationalities. Here’s a quick guide to the key relationshipsEveryone in the UK is a friendless loser. Not my words, but those (slightly paraphrased) of a recent Snapchat survey that found British people have fewer close mates than other nationalities. With 2.6 “best friends” on average, compared with the frankly excessive 6.6 boasted by participants in Saudi Arabia, and one in seven of us reporting no best friends at all, the results paint a damning portrait of a seemingly lonely populace. A nation of Briton-no-mates.Mind you, new research by MIT reckons humans can only cope with a maximum of five close friends, so we wouldn’t know what to do with more even if we had them. These findings corroborate 1990s research by the British anthropologist Robin Dunbar, who suggested a correlation between brain size and social relationships. In other words: humans are only capable of having a finite number of people in our social sphere at any given time, because we’re all a bunch of numpties. Now, I’m no scientist, but based on how dramatically my stress levels spike whenever I receive more than one text message before 11am, I’d say that checks out.Despite being a significant cornerstone of a healthy social life, friends can be strangely transitory. From our first encounters in infant school, when we bond over crayons and crisps, to agonising encounters in our 20s, when we bond over sexual attraction and hating the same people on Twitter, the makeup of our social circles will change in accordance with how we – hopefully – evolve as iniduals.That first core group becomes a rotating cast. Some may remain as key protagonists, others are recurring characters, and there will inevitably be many, many regrettable cameos. But in these fraught, isolationist times, let us take a moment to consider our mates. Who are they and what can they tell us about ourselves?Our first comrade of convenience, the School Friend enters our life before we’ve had time to develop a personality. This is especially cruel because these are also our most formative years, so everyone remembers everything. Think of all the names you still know in full, the faces you remember, the houses you can still picture, the girl you were briefly close with in year 5 because you got put in maths together and spent the entire class trying to see how many dicks you could draw on a rubber – and then basically never spoke to again. Mad, really, how GCSE results day isn’t also accompanied by a gracious ceremony in which everyone has their memory erased, Men In Black-style. Seems like an oversight.Once you do start to find yourself, these early connections go one of three ways: you drift apart in secondary school and never hear about them again until your mum bumps into their mum in Sainsbury’s you stay friends long enough to have each other on Facebook, where you occasionally like photos of their baby or you stay friends for ever, know them best of anyone in the world, and are ultimately tasked with delivering a thoughtful but humorous eulogy at their funeral, during which you break the tension by calling them an “old git” for dying first.You see them the most, talk to them the most and have the most in-jokes with them because you spend eight hours a day, five days a week together in the same shipping container office spaceon Slackbehind a bar. But, at the same time, they know the least about you. You have a shared language, a veritable buffet of niche references, but they couldn’t tell you how many siblings you have, or how old you are. In fact, if it weren’t for the office email, would they even know your last name?You will have lunch together twice a week for three years until one of you resigns, and then you will never see them again until you bump into them at Latitude, where you have precisely one beer and realise the only thing you had in common was complaining about the work toilets.An extremely shallow, but incredibly pivotal, relationship, the Sesh Friend is the person who, regardless of time or place, can always be relied on to respond to your Bat-Signal text: “’Spoons?”These are people you don’t know on any real level, but still share a wealth of emotional experiences with, always ending up on the same tired sofa at afterparties, watching old Talking Heads performances on YouTube while they describe a podcast they once listened to about doppelgängers. Never underestimate the bonding agent that is cracking open the last Tyskie to share as the sky turns cold.Beyond these semi-deep 5am experiences, you have no involvement with them whatsoever. You have never once met for coffee, would never dream of lending each other money, and the only chats you have outside of the sesh are regarding where to meet for the sesh.The Internet Friend is basically the inverse of Sesh Friend they know everything about you except what you’re actually like. They’re clued up on the tedious minutiae of your life – what aesthetic you’re feeling at the moment, what mood you were in at 6.19pm last Tuesday, how you couldn’t have a burrito for lunch because the place around the corner from your office was closed for some reason. You exchange playlists, long emails, constant DMs perhaps you even send each other gifts in the post. But they have no idea about your physical presence, your tics and mannerisms, the geometry of your face cracking into a smile at that gif of a puppy jumping into a bush.Nevertheless, the Internet Friend holds an enormous amount of weight. The distance means you often tell them things you might find difficult to say IRL, especially if you spend a lot of time online because you’re struggling in your social life. Whether you met them on Tumblr, in a forum for people with a specific medical condition, or through a zealous appreciation of each other’s crap tweets, the Internet Friend can be a guiding light, offering support from the other side of the world. At certain points, you might even call them your closest friend.Until you meet them, that is. Never do that.University is a microcycle of your entire life in friendships. You spend the first year talking to everyone, throwing shit at a wall to see what sticks. By the second year, you might have two or three different socials circles that overlap, Venn diagram-like, containing people you like to varying degrees.By the third year, you can’t be arsed. By now, there are about four people on the entire campus you get on with, and you’re too tired to keep putting in work with the rest. The likelihood of those four people genuinely enjoying each other’s company is even slimmer, so you spend the last 12 months of your degree either enjoying one-on-one hangouts, or going out in massive groups of people whose names you’ll struggle to remember when tagging your graduation photos.Too many of us feel compelled to stick around people we don’t like simply because they’ve been there for ages, or we did, at one point, consider them a friend – but frankly, life’s too short for that. If you’re fundamentally at odds with someone, stop forcing those awkward monthly catch-ups at Costa, the ones that end with a Kardashian-style barny because you said something uncomplimentary about their new squeeze, and cut them out. Who has the time?Equally, though – is there any greater driving force for success than hatred? Do the achievements of a frenemy not spur you to greater heights? Do your own achievements not then feel even sweeter? Ultimately, a frenemy’s value is dependent on how you fare on bitterness and competition. If the answer is “I thrive”, then these might be the greatest relationships of your life. Why do you think Fleetwood Mac were so successful?Twitter user @queentrashcan recently defined the background friend in a viral post, which read: “i don’t fit in with any particular group of friends. they all are closer with each other and i sometimes link on but am permanent with no one. i think about all these people constantly but i don’t think i cross their minds often.”Basically the concept is: a lone wolf who has no established friendship group. This is someone you always say hello to on a night out, ask who they’re with, then realise it’s you. While you have nothing but good things to say about this person, you rarely invite them anywhere because someone else always seems to. Everyone assumes the background friend is better friends with someone else, while the background friend themselves is elusive familiar to many groups, but a key player in none. Big Donnie Darko energy.Honestly, though, I’m not convinced this is a real thing. People are emotionally stunted and rarely vocalise what other people mean to them, so I would argue that the background friend is a state of mind more often than it is an identity. Then again, who among us has not had a quiet moment in the toilet at a house party, thousand-yard staring into the cabinet mirror, worrying that, if you died tomorrow, there might be no one who knows your favourite song is Californication.There are some notable downsides to being a new parent: the temporary dip in sexual activity, sleep deprivation, having to raise a healthy, happy baby in the context of humanity’s uncertain future on our rapidly dying planet. But the worst has to be taking your kid to playgroup and having to talk to other parents. And so, for a time, you will spend several hours a week listening to Karen talk about getting reiki for her swollen feet, and you will smile politely, and say, “Oh, that’s interesting” even if it isn’t, because she’s the only adult company you’ve had all week.These are the ultimate in circumstantial friends – like partners of friends, or the relatives of long-term partners, whom you must accept as your own, despite having nothing in common.Best friends comprise the most fulfilling, longstanding and volatile relationships of your life. These are the legends who will support you unequivocally when you’re going through a rough time, but will also tell you when you’re behaving like an arsehole or have food in your teeth. Of course, the closer you are, the deeper the arguments – but, ultimately, these are the smug bastards who know you better than you know yourself. A best friend will listen to your worst thoughts and not judge. A best friend will rib you when you need humbling, and cook for you when you’re down in the dumps. Most importantly though, a best friend will let you post a photo on Instagram in which you look great but they look truly awful, because they know you’re trying to pull someone.

I bought my first album in WHSmith in Hemel Hempstead. Kings Of The Wild Frontier, by Adam and the Ants, since you ask. On cassette. Like Mr Ant, Hemel was the future once. In 1980, it was in full new-town mode. To get there, Dad had to negotiate the dual carriageways, ring roads and the infamous Magic Roundabout, past the Kodak HQ, the fabulous Dacorum sports centre where I learned to doggy paddle, and perfectly manicured water meadow municipal gardens. I loved Hemel. Especially as it was two towns in one. To the north of the new town was the old town: higgledy high street, antique shops, Norman church and bow-fronted cottages. Now Hemel is three towns in one, the old town and the new town having in turn been gobbled up by the future. Hemel’s new new town is mostly composed of executive homes, Cineworld and the brassy Marlowes shopping mall. The Kodak site has become a luxury apartment complex. And doggy paddling is outgunned by “extreme sports” centres and an indoor ski centre. The future has better coffee.

The Walt Disney Company is a famously unbending organisation, and yet Beyoncé appears to have got it to hand over the assets of the highest-grossing entertainment property in history so she can make an album, released in direct competition with the soundtrack of the new remake, complete with a cameo role for her seven-year-old daughter.Initially, it seems as if Beyoncé thinks the US writer – who recently opined that what was wrong with The Lion King remake was that they hadn’t changed the plot so that Beyoncé’s character was the leading role and replaced the songs with songs by Beyoncé – had a point. Her album feels like an alternative soundtrack. The opening Bigger and Find Your Way Back seem like riffs on Circle of Life – the former a slightly rambling self-help ballad that kicks into life three quarters of the way through the latter an understated pop track underpinned by a rhythm track inspired by Afrobeats.But after that, things take a noticeably different turn. If you subsequently never want for expressions of Beyoncé’s own fabulousness – “I’m piña colada-ing  you stay Ramada Inn,” she snaps on Mood 4 Eva – it also becomes apparent that the line about the album being “curated” by Beyoncé is key. She keeps ceding the stage entirely to far less celebrated artists, from Nigerian Afro-pop singer Burna Boy to Brooklyn rapper SAINt JHN. The Gift is an album on which a guest star as big as Kendrick Lamar gets less spotlight than up-and-comer Tierra Whack. On one level, that is a shame – Lamar sounds great on Nile, but the track feels truncated, a largely beatless wash of synths that lasts under two minutes – but it’s hard to deny the sheer force of Tierra Whack’s verse on My Power, a ferocious blast of percussion, fizzing electronic drone and vocals in isiXhosa that might be the best thing here.Indeed, the guest spots occasionally overshadow the star. The Beyoncé-led tracks are of distinctly variable quality. For every song as good as the brilliant Black Skin Girl or Mood 4 Eva, there is something underwhelming. Spirit (equal parts show-tune and Donna Summer’s State of Independence), and Otherside (a standard-issue ballad rescued by the gorgeous rolling piano sample that runs through it), cover ground she’s trodden more memorably before – she might have been better off saving the best stuff for her next solo album. By contrast, there is a real crackle of excitement about Don’t Jealous Me, on which Nigerian vocalists Tekno, Yemi Alade and Mr Eazi trade verses, or the way 070 Shake and Jessie Reyez’s Scar suddenly shifts from piano-backed lament into distorted hip-hop.Beyoncé has put these artists together and co-produced every track, giving the dominant Afrobeats sound a vast new level of exposure – an impressive feat in itself. It’s an album, then, that ably displays her excellent taste, rather than a great Beyoncé album per se."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f87c6a5180443e0846d7867290ef7f9feca5c347/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fa5b2be7f43f1693b1bc69f2f79845a","title":"ed sheeran dominates uk charts with double no 1 no 6 collorations project","story":"New album No 6 Collaborations Project outsells the rest of the Top 30 put together, and has three singles in the Top 5Ed Sheeran has topped the UK albums and singles charts this week, following the release of his new album, No 6 Collaborations Project.The album outsold the rest of the Top 30 albums put together, and is the year’s fastest-selling album so far, scoring 125,000 combined sales from 57,000 physical sales, 18,000 downloads and 70.2m track streams.The song Beautiful People, his collaboration with Khalid, reaches No 1 in the singles chart after two weeks at No 3, making it Sheeran’s seventh No 1 single in the UK.

In October 2018 it closed its resale sites Get Me In! and Seatwave, and launched a fan-to-fan resale exchange this spring. In a blog post, Ticketmaster said: “We’ve listened and we hear you: secondary sites just don’t cut it any more and you’re tired of seeing others snap up tickets just to resell for a profit. All we want is you, the fan, to be able to buy tickets to the events you love. We’re excited about making ticketing simpler.”Roux said the plan had to be concealed and proposed that “either a Live Nation employee or a venue box office basically take these and sell them into a singular account”, after which they would be listed and sold on secondary sites.Also on the line was Vaughn Millette, now chairman and CEO of concert promoter Outback Presents, who sent a legally obtained recording of the call to Live Nation executives and board members. Billboard obtained the tape from a source close to Live Nation.In a statement shared with the , Live Nation said it did not have a practice of placing tickets on the secondary market. “Our standard practice is to use Ticketmaster’s Platinum, VIP and other tools to help tours price closer to true market value. In this situation, a consultant for the band opted to use the secondary market to try to capture that value.“In 2016, Metallica performed a single show in Minneapolis at which more than 10,000 tickets were transacted on the secondary market without the band’s participation. After seeing the volume of secondary transactions for that show and the benefit being captured by brokers, the independent consultant worked with Live Nation on a unique distribution strategy that used the secondary market as a sales distribution channel for select high-end tickets.”The promoter’s admission nonetheless clarifies longstanding industry rumours about tickets for major tours being sold on the secondary market before being sold at face value. Billboard states that it also reveals how the rise of online ticket sites has put “pressure on artists and promoters to capture more of the profits resellers are making”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59e50977069728d6155d217c88e141aa2501ce0/0_18_4904_2944/master/4904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc1052292384ee91932455652a219d97","title":"has brexit saved the lib dems","story":"The Lib Dems have made an extraordinary comeback in 2019 because of their anti-Brexit stance.

As a socialist feminist, the idea that one of the great movements of human liberation in our times could be reduced to getting a few more female Tory MPs into parliament is truly depressing.Gill acknowledges that Tory austerity policies have been terrible for working-class women, but makes no mention of how the scandals of Windrush, Grenfell and the hostile policy towards asylum seekers and immigrants, which can be directly traced to May’s time at the Home Office, show class politics at its most brutal and demonstrate indifference to the lives of the most vulnerable women.I could never understand those who celebrated figures like Margaret Thatcher as female firsts when she had no interest in, and actually worked against the liberation of, most women. Feminism is about taking structural inequality seriously. It needs to be allied to anti-racist and class-based solidarity movements because it is a movement for equality and justice for all women, not just a means of ensuring equal representation among the ranks of the establishment. Having a few more Tory women elected to a position where they can continue to defend their own class interests and work against most women is nothing to do with feminism as I understand it.Allegra MadgwickLondon• Martha Gill says Theresa May “stood up for victims of domestic abuse”. Is this the same Theresa May who led a government whose austerity policies resulted in funding cuts for women’s refuges, a number of which have had to close as a result? These closures will have put many women’s lives at risk.Hester DohertyShrewsbury, Shropshire• I think you are too kind to Theresa May (Editorial, 18 July). She has, on occasions, made speeches that might indicate her being “cognisant of responsibilities attached to her office”, but her actions have rarely lived up to these. As home secretary she increased the already high level of institutional racism with the hostile environment policy, and as prime minister she talked about those “just about managing” while worsening their position with increasing cuts to welfare benefits.Judy StoberBruton, Somerset• Any assessment of Theresa May’s performance over the past three years would be incomplete without noting her failure to respond adequately to the human suffering arising from the fire at Grenfell Tower. It would seem that the associated legacy is one of fading interest in resolving the safety issues in a timely fashion, and slowing down the process of requiring landlords to listen to tenants rather than just banking their rent money (Government inaction putting lives at risk after Grenfell - MPs, 18 July).Les BrightExeter, Devon• You have to wonder at the mind of a prime minister who can rail at Brexit absolutists (May swipes at ‘rancour and hatred’ of Brexit absolutists, 18 July) after fronting a minority government kept in office only by a party of the 10 most uncompromising MPs in the UK, having set her own red lines without consulting with other parties on what kind of Brexit we should have, and who put forward the same rejected plan over and over because she could conceive of no other way forward.Mark LewinskiSwaffham Prior, Cambridgeshire• Theresa May could give real effect to her “coded swipe” at the Brexiters who undermined her premiership by using her final day as prime minister to revoke article 50.Kip BennettWest Drayton, London• I note Theresa May’s advocacy of enhanced paternity leave (Journal, 19 July) and wonder if she’d consider making it compulsory.

What Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin described as the “magnificent desolation” of the relentlessly grey surface is littered with clapped-out robots, spacecraft parts, moon buggies (including one with a bible on the dashboard) and technical equipment.Scattered around the Apollo landing sites are other items that were never meant to come home: a falcon’s feather, a javelin, bags of human waste, a family photo and an aluminium figure, the Fallen Astronaut, which lies on its side near a plaque bearing the names of 14 men who died in the pursuit of space exploration.In all, the lunar junkyard holds nearly 200 tonnes of human objects. The dusty remains of five Saturn V rocket stages from the Apollo missions are the heaviest single items. Then there are the wreckages of spacecraft that smashed, or were crashed intentionally at the end of their missions, into the lunar surface. There are a dozen 1960s Soviet Luna probes nearly twice as many US Rangers, Lunar Orbiters, Surveyors and more recent observatories at least four Japanese spacecraft, and other robots sent from Europe, China and India. In April, the mangled remains of the first private moon mission, Israel Aerospace Industries’ Beresheet probe, became the latest addition when the lander’s gyroscopes failed.More striking are those that met a more gentle end. Besides all the wreckages strewn across the moon are robotic landers and rovers that simply fell silent, their batteries spent or their hardware worn out. The Luna 9, the first spacecraft to achieve a soft landing, is there on the western edge of the near side of the moon. So is the Soviets’ magnificent, eight-wheeled Lunokhod 1, the first lunar rover, which in 1970 trundled around the Mare Imbrium, or Sea of Rains. Joining them in the lunar graveyard are Surveyor 1, the first of several American probes to land softly on the surface, and three moon buggies discarded by Apollo 15, 16 and 17. James Irwin, an Apollo 15 astronaut, left a bible on the dashboard of his mission’s buggy. The most recent rover to shut down on the moon was China’s Yutu, or Jade Rabbit, which has not been heard from since 2015.Beyond the crashed, the ditched and the broken down are pieces of equipment and personal effects that astronauts left behind. The least charming are 96 bags for poo, urine and vomit that scientists, being scientists, are keen to get their hands on should the opportunity arise. More difficult to find will be the two golf balls that the Apollo 14 astronaut Alan Shepard hit for “miles and miles” and the metal rod, described by Nasa as a “javelin”, lobbed by Edgar Mitchell, the sixth man on the moon.The crew of Apollo 15 carried an 8.5cm-tall aluminium figure to the moon. Created by the Belgian artist Paul Van Hoeydonck, the Fallen Astronaut was laid on its side with a plaque listing the names of astronauts and cosmonauts who died during the space race. At the end of Apollo 15’s final moonwalk, David Scott pulled out a falcon’s feather and a hammer and demonstrated Galileo’s theory that in the absence of air resistance, different objects fall at the same rate. The items are still there, along with 12 pairs of boots one hundred $2 bills taken into space as good luck charms a small gold olive branch left by Neil Armstrong as a symbol of peace and a family photo placed on the ground by Charles Duke, the Apollo 16 astronaut who in 1972 became the 10th and youngest person to walk on the moon.There is an abundance of technical junk there, too. The Apollo landing sites are littered with cameras, power packs, tongs, drills, towels, brushes, rakes and trenching tools, and scientific experiments that measured dust, seismic vibrations and the solar wind. Some of the artefacts still serve a scientific purpose. Retroreflectors installed on the moon by the Apollo astronauts and the Lunokhod 1 and 2 missions have been used to measure the Earth-moon distance with laser beams for the past 50 years.The parts and pieces that dot the surface are only the most physical remnants of humanity’s intimate encounter with the moon. Less enduring are the marks in the ground, the footprints first made 50 years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/943f5957e5ddda60e40df21bac391b3506bb476e/5_113_1890_1134/master/1890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e01e6bb6519fd83c982d4ce8da44a9ca","title":"engagement and connection the key to reaching scotlands addicts","story":"A number of pioneering projects suggest Scotland doesn’t need radical legal reform to stop addicts dyingEvery Monday afternoon, a steady stream of drug users at various stages of treatment gravitate to a cafe-style clinic based at a charity centre in Midlothian.Sitting around a table with their teas and coffees, their chat encompasses anything from childhood memories to last night’s telly. There is an ongoing debate about whether Lidl or Aldi make better pop chips. Dogs are welcome.“I overheard a lovely conversation the other week,” says Tracey Clusker, nurse manager for substance misuse at Midlothian health and social care partnership, and the driving force behind this ground-breaking approach to reaching some of Scotland’s most at-risk addicts.“Someone was struggling with diazepam use, then someone else shared: ‘This is how I’ve coped’. There’s a real concern for one another, how they manage their addiction day to day. People who have gone into rehab still come in, so they see that people are getting well and there’s always that hope that things can change.”While Tuesday’s shocking drug-related death figures, which put Scotland on a par with the US, have prompted calls for radical action, including decriminalisation, experts and frontline practitioners emphasise there is plenty to be done to save lives within the existing law.Clusker’s cafe-clinic is almost unique in a treatment landscape dominated by what many consider an outdated and rigid medical model. There’s an open-door policy here nobody is turned away, regardless of when they last used illegal drugs. And there’s a prescriber present, so if heroin users want to receive their opioid substitution treatment – usually methadone – here they can, with an initial prescription available within one week.But there are also peer support workers to talk to, access to housing and benefits advice, mental health referrals, physical health checks, and a chance to pick up clean needles or overdose-reversing naloxone kits.Clusker had the idea for this low-threshold drop-in clinic after clients told her about feeling judged in traditional healthcare settings, being discharged from treatment for missing appointments or failing urine tests, or being scared to attend if they were still using illegal drugs on top of their methadone.“It’s about engagement and connection, and that’s just as important as the methadone or buprenorphine prescription,” she says.With 15 years’ experience in the field, Clusker believes the key to keeping these people alive is to keep them in treatment, where they can receive a regular dose of a heroin substitute. This therapeutic dose must be high enough to sustain the inidual – experts point to a culture of low dosing in many NHS services, with the unintended and dangerous consequence of self-medication with other drugs.“This is really a clinic that’s treating trauma,” says Clusker. “What people are doing is using drugs as a solution to very difficult life experiences. I see a high proportion of looked-after children, or those affected by parental drug abuse, domestic violence, child sexual abuse. It’s also linked to poverty, austerity. There’s not many people at that clinic enjoying drug use. It’s not a choice.”“We have patients who, as they get older, are very ambivalent about whether they are living or not,” says John Budd, a GP at the Edinburgh Access Practice and another local pioneer, who runs an innovative drop-in service for a similar cohort of homeless patients in the city centre. “They are continually defeated by the welfare system, by healthcare. They can’t wait the three-month average time it takes to get on to treatment. We have to work very hard to establish relationships with this group.”Progress means meeting people on their terms, says Budd. He runs a regular pet clinic at the practice, which can give owners the opportunity to start a conversation about their own health needs, and offers outreach sessions at a nearby homeless crisis centre.But how do the lessons of one innovative practice apply to an entire system? It is partly a question of resources, says Budd: drug and alcohol services are still recovering from a significant funding cut made by the Scottish government two years ago. “But there is a culture change needed. We put too many barriers in people’s way, while practitioners can still be risk-averse or lack training.”The Scottish drug treatment system is “a black hole”, says Andrew McAuley, a senior research fellow at Glasgow Caledonian University. The highly respected health policy analyst, who has worked in the health service for 15 years, says: “The system is fragmented, under-resourced and is the same as it was 20 year ago, but people are using much more lethal poly-drug combinations now, with the rise of street benzos and injecting cocaine. They need the wraparound services because the cases are much more complex. But these are the things that get stripped out when funding becomes tight.”McAuley contrasts what he sees as the current “political inertia” with Scotland’s world-leading approach to take-home naloxone – the antidote to opioid overdose – which was implemented nationally in 2011 and cited as an example of best practice by the World Health Organization.Scotland’s public health minister, Joe Fitzpatrick, has committed to a public health approach to problem drug use in the wake of the latest fatality figures, having recently appointed a taskforce to consider international evidence around decriminalisation and drug consumption rooms, as well as investigating challenges around treatment services and stigma. But bereaved families want action.“All everybody does is speak about it, what needs to be done, what they would like to do if they had the powers,” says Anne McDermott, whose son Scott died of a drug overdose in Edinburgh last year at the age of 35.Scott was found to have six different drugs, including methadone, in his system when he died, and McDermott is perhaps understandably sceptical about the worth of substitution treatment alone.She wants to see more rehab places, support for those trying to manage on methadone at home, and better use of drug treatment orders – a potentially life-saving community sanction that a recent freedom of information request from the Scottish Liberal Democrats found was used only 37 times in response to 3,600 convictions for possession in 2017-18.McDermott believes that in big cities like Edinburgh, the public and the authorities have become inured to discarded needles, obviously intoxicated beggars and “just another junkie death”.“They don’t ask the addicts what they need. They don’t ask those that would sell their soul for a bag, whose children are in care because drugs mean more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69dd69e006926305c482a43ebcb837bc08075a09/121_39_891_535/master/891.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c016cc8b844945bcbc35c6fe143ae91","title":"96 year old roy englert runs 42 minute 5k to shatter age group world record","story":"Roy Englert, 96, added yet another world record to his collection at last week’s USATF Masters Outdoor Championships, running the 5000m in 42:30.23 to shatter the existing age-group mark by nearly eight minutes at the Cyclone Sports Complex in Ames, Iowa.The Virginia native, who already held the 95 to 99 age group records for the 800m and 1500m and is a member of the world record 4x100, 4x400 and 4x800 relay teams, broke Frank Levine’s decade-old record of 50:10.56.The new mark is still pending approval by USATF.According to a Run Washington profile, Englert lives at a Lake Ridge retirement community and does most of his running on a treadmill: two to three miles for three days a week, or upping the mileage if a competition is nearing.“It’s fun. It’s not fun while you’re doing it, but it’s fun when you’re finished,” he said. “It’s hard work, actually.”Englert, a retired attorney, credits his late-career success to not to any natural gift but dogged persistence.“I don’t consider myself that much of an inspiration. I’m a slow runner,” he told Run Washington. “But I guess I’ve outlasted almost everybody. It gets easier to win when there’s not as much competition around.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ef2198d348f27556c38d8f4caca0c66bbf69744/0_68_2042_1225/master/2042.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a79e5fd9bd09c0f84c55362a74c972b","title":"england familiar foe netball world cup semi final","story":"Seven days, six games, 410 goals scored and 188 turnovers: it is fair to say England’s netballers have earned their rest day before Saturday’s World Cup semi-final against New Zealand. But Jo Harten insisted there would be “no switching off” as the team approach the final weekend of the tournament, knowing this is their best chance of winning the title in its 56-year history.Harten, the goal attack whose superstar shooting partnership with Helen Housby is the driver of this England team, said England would spend the day studying their semi-final opponents after the victory over South Africa on Thursday confirmed they would face the Silver Ferns. New Zealand finished second in their group after being beaten by Australia in a nailbiting final group game, a match that Tracey Neville and several of the England players had chosen not to view before they took to the court.“I haven’t watched them too much,” said Harten. “I’ve analysed them before coming in here and I’ll analyse them again … I just know they are a class act. Losing by one to Australia is no mean feat.” Many of the Kiwi players are well known to Harten and her teammates, who compete against them in the Australian Suncorp League.Housby and Harten’s symbiosis in the shooting circle is always a crucial factor when England take on Australia and New Zealand, the superpowers of world netball. It even has its own moniker, H2, and the unintended nod to science seems to capture their essence – two atoms, locked together in perfect harmony, filling their end of the court with Brownian motion. As Harten has said, it is a symmetry born of mutual affection, and plenty of strategising: “It doesn’t just happen overnight. We’ve been working solidly on our own games out in Australia.”Another key player will be the captain, Serena Guthrie, the bulldog of England’s performances this week, earning the admiration of many of her rivals including New Zealand’s captain, Laura Langman. The veteran centre of 157 caps, who has called her opponent “the most influential centre in the world”, anticipates a titanic battle. “I think she looks so fit,” said Langman. “Serena loves an event and it’s going to be one.”Given how fervent the atmosphere inside the M\u0026ampS Bank Arena has been all week, there is a chance the semi-finals will rupture a few eardrums. Neville has admitted that early on the intensity of the England fans scared her and even made her players a little nervous. Now she does not want to live without them.The New Zealand coach, Noeline Taurua, expects home advantage to play a role for England. “I think a crowd does make a difference but you’ve also got to be able to deliver,” she said. “It can bring a bit of pressure either way.” Her own side will be looking to raise their game after on-the-buzzer defeat to Australia, who remain the favourites to lift the trophy.“It’s good to get a taste of that sort of pressure and that challenge,” said Taurua. “We’ve still got a little bit to go to be able to keep up and put our dominant performance out there.” As for England, she praised their attacking line, including Chelsea Pitman – who has been a world champion once already, for Australia, before switching her allegiance to England.But the Silver Ferns coach is also well aware that, ever since Layla Guscoth ruptured her achilles at the start of the week, the Roses squad is a defender down, and that has meant a bigger workload for the remaining players. “It will be interesting to see how their defence handle it, knowing that they’ve been one down for the last couple of days,” said Taurua.Nor is England’s backline a young one – Eboni Usoro-Brown is 31 and Geva Mentor, still rated as the world’s best goalkeeper, is 34. Rotating players has been essential for Neville ever since losing Guscoth, with even a 10-minute rest on the bench vital for preserving energy levels.And while Mentor was looking forward to a day of rest and recovery, England’s second most-capped player also said her body was “holding up nicely.” “I’m actually feeling great out there,” said Mentor. “I keep surprising myself every time I go out for a run.”England’s semi-final will be the second of the day at 3pm. Australia play South Africa at 11.15am in a game they will be widely expected to win after Norma Plummer’s Proteas were humbled by England in their last group match. An Australia-England final on Sunday afternoon would be a repeat of the Commonwealth Games gold medal match that Neville’s players stole in the final second of the game, and there is no doubting that the Diamonds’ coach, Lisa Alexander – and her players – would relish the chance for revenge in front of an England crowd. As Langman pointed out, there is no reason to fear the roar of the Roses fans: “You’ve just got to pretend they are cheering for you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f19f8afcd7943436635211affc9be4c97208eb51/0_13_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7b4f8b63e9939fea534cf78626a595c","title":"irish cricket comes age lords england test fraught twisting odyssey world cup","story":"World Cup success and clubs founded by immigrants have transformed the image of a game once ostracised as a symbol of BritishnessWhen Ireland’s cricketers play England in their first ever Test match at Lord’s next week it will be the latest chapter in that quaintest of things: an Anglo-Irish romance. Whatever the final score the visitors, including thousands of travelling supporters, intend to celebrate with the hosts a shared passion impervious to the toxic political zeitgeist.“To see 11 men with shamrocks on their tummy coming out of the tunnel – that’s something I never thought I’d see in my lifetime,” says Heatley Tector, the president of the YMCA cricket club, a venerable club in Sandymount, Dublin. “Lord’s is where the elite of cricket play. Lord’s is the mecca.”From Wednesday to Saturday the London ground is where Irish cricket, for so long tangled in perceptions of national identity, will show it has come of age. Once ostracised as a symbol of foreignness, of Britishness, it is now an all-Ireland venture proud of its multinational credentials: coaches and players from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh. Even, gasp, England.“It’s an enormous occasion for us to be on the world stage,” says Richard Holdsworth, the performance director at Cricket Ireland, the sport’s governing body. “Playing in a Test match is special. Playing against England is even more special. And at Lord’s – that’s a dream for a lot of the lads.”A symbiotic relationship connects cricket across the Irish Sea. Holdsworth, a key figure in paving Ireland’s path to Lord’s, is English. Karl McDermott, the head groundsman at Lord’s, is Irish. Eoin Morgan, who led England to World Cup glory last Sunday, is from Dublin. Asked at a press conference if that triumph was assisted by the luck of the Irish, Morgan smiled and credited a team with erse roots and faiths: “We had Allah with us as well.”Ireland, a footnote in world cricket for much of the 20th century, vaulted into the top ranks by acquiring Test status in 2017, the fruit of a decade-long effort to expand, improve and meet International Cricket Council requirements. They came close to beating Pakistan at Malahide last year and lost badly to Afghanistan in India in March. Few expect a win in their third Test, even with England resting some of their World Cup winners.“It will be tricky,” says Brian O’Rourke, who used to coach a teenage Morgan and is now development manager for Cricket Leinster. “But the occasion will be huge. It will be a great showcase for what we can do.”It will also showcase a side of Anglo-Irish relations ringfenced from Brexit rancour. The latest insult came in a report about Boris Johnson mocking the Indian heritage of Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar. “Why isn’t he called Murphy like all the rest of them?” Days earlier Jacob Rees-Mogg attempted to politicise England’s World Cup victory: “We clearly don’t need Europe to win.”That drew derision for overlooking the fact that five members of the 15-strong squad were born outside the UK. Ireland’s fraught, twisting odyssey to Lord’s contains an additional, tacit riposte to isive rhetoric because it ends with an embrace of outsiders. Cricket was hugely popular in the 19th century, parishes across the country boasting clubs, until surging Irish nationalism in the form of the Gaelic Athletic Association declared the game an alien English import. “Unfortunately the GAA won that battle,” says Tector. Cricket became associated with “castle Catholics” and “west Brits” – posh Irish anglophiles. During the 1919-21 war of independence a suspected IRA gunman opened fire on a game at Trinity College Dublin, killing a spectator, Kathleen Wright.The game shrivelled, just a few dozen schools and clubs pursuing their lonely passion. Attitudes began to change in the 1970s when televised Test matches showed cricket to be a global – and at times thrilling – game. By his own admission Tector, 55, was a mediocre player – “shite” in fact – but he bequeathed passion to his three sons, all of whom have played for the national youth team, and to his daughter. “She’s probably the best of them, though she’d never say it.” Perhaps because they are a small tribe, Ireland’s cricketers pass the bug from father to son, mother to daughter, brother to sister.“It’s very family focused,” says Alan Lewis, a former Cricket Ireland chairman of selectors, speaking at Clontarf cricket club as children carry out drills under a bright Dublin sun. They are being coached by Isobel Joyce, who represented Ireland in last year’s World Cup, and is the sister of Ed Joyce, who left Ireland and played one-day internationals for England before returning home and playing his one and only Test against Pakistan.Success transformed the game’s image in Ireland. At their inaugural World Cup in 2007 the men’s team knocked out Pakistan and made it to the Super Eight stage, prompting a rapturous homecoming. They scored another shock by beating England in the 2011 World Cup. Subsequent results disappointed. Young players struggled to fill gaps left by John Mooney, Trent Johnston and other stars who retired.Ireland remains a minnow – about 130 clubs compared to 6,000 in England, with an annual budget of only €10m, says Holdsworth. “It’s tough. We have to be extremely careful with money.” But he believes that restructuring over the past decade – more professionalism, coaches, training facilities, academies and clubs – augur improvement and will help keep talent at home rather than migrate to England.Brexit burgled cricket for the term “backstop”, which is now politically radioactive, but in Ireland the game has an all-island structure that transcends the border – and politics – without any fuss. It also embodies a globalised Ireland that imports coaching talent from around the world. New clubs founded by immigrants from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh are sprouting across west Dublin. Afghans are doing the same around Cork. “They’ll play anywhere, in a car park, a tennis court, anywhere that’s flat enough,” says Holdsworth.The squad to face England includes Simranjit “Simi” Singh, who was born in India. Ehtesham Ahmed, a contender for Pakistan’s national team before moving to Ireland, has played 17 seasons in his adopted country. “People notice I never miss a game. I tell them I just love my cricket. The passion rubs off,” the 37-year-old says. Friends back in Karachi tease him over his allegiance.“I back the shamrock against Pakistan. What can I say? This is my home now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a2cc7aadcc120fbad337afcf1ba735408045ccc/0_241_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb371bf5154d137cf62a6a1d08055f09","title":"marianne vos wins la course 2019 after powerful finish in pau","story":"Marianne Vos of the Netherlands completed an irresistible win in La Course, the one-day women’s race organised by the Tour de France, outsprinting a select group that included last year’s champion and the recent winner of the Giro Rosa, Annemiek van Vleuten.Vos, who won the first edition of La Course in Paris in 2014, put in a devastating sprint in the final 150m of the circuit race in Pau to leave her rivals trailing in her wake.“I was well positioned just behind the Sunweb train,” Vos said. “We came to that final corner to the steep hill and on instinct I just went from the bottom, full gas to the finish. When I came around the last corner I saw I had quite a good lead. Lactic acid was everywhere but it was quite a good feeling.”While Vos celebrated an impressive success, it was a less than auspicious day for Lizzie Deignan of Great Britain, who endured a series of misfortunes in the 121km race, based on the men’s inidual time trial circuit.“I was pretty unfortunate today,” Deignan said. “I had two bike changes, both at the bottom of the climb where everything kicked off, and the second was when all the attacks came so it was pretty much race over for me.”But Deignan, who is building her form steadily towards this autumn’s Yorkshire-based UCI World Road Championships, added that her legs felt “pretty good”. “I’m pretty happy with myself,” she said, after finishing in 77th place, more than 11 minutes behind Vos. She is now heading to Japan to reconnoitre the 2020 Olympic Games course.Despite a series of statements of intent both from ASO, the parent company of the Tour de France, and the UCI, cycling’s governing body presided over by David Lappartient, the return of a standalone women’s Tour de France appears as distant as ever.Vos, who was one of the figureheads of a movement lobbying for a greater profile for women’s racing six years ago, prior to the first edition of La Course, was diplomatic when asked if she felt real progress had been made. “Women’s cycling is not only La Course,” Vos said. “It has been growing over the last five years, with bigger teams and better organisation and better riders.“The level of the field is growing and getting more depth. I think it’s getting more and more professional, but La Course is one moment in the year when the whole world is watching and that’s a big plus for women’s cycling.“A lot of things are changing. The calendar is growing and getting bigger. The teams are getting bigger, but not a bigger roster, so at the moment it’s more important to change the calendar a bit than to add more and more races. You want the best teams in the best races in the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cefae52ba82e9f3a822703b72e5279dc377904b/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05707907ea494a73f7f4b734574122e1","title":"cricket england australia womens ashes test day two live","story":"Australia added 118 runs in the morning, and then it rained all afternoon to leave England’s chances of Ashes-saving success looking as dim as the Taunton skiesAnd so, the day is done. I’ve been here for four hours without seeing a ball bowled. One of those days. They’ll be back for more tomorrow, when there’s a chance of morning rain but it should be over in time for play to get under way at 11am. With two days to go, the draw looks very much the most likely outcome. Adam Collins and Tanya Aldred will take you through Saturday. Have a great weekend. Bye!It’s all over (for now)! The umpires have given up on making it back out today, and everyone has been told to go home.I’m awaiting the coup de grace, but in the meantime play remains a notional possibility. Here in the meantime is a picture of someone in Taunton with an umbrella.I have an update! It’s still raining.Geoff has emailed again. “They’re done,” he reports. “It’s just started absolutely tipping down.” It might take half an hour or so before it’s official confirmed.It is, I’m told, pouring in Taunton. Geoff Lemon reckons I should “put my feet up and mix a piña colada”. I do quite like a piña colada, as it happens, but drink them approximately once a decade and absolutely never have the ingredients required to make one at home. This is something I should probably improve on in future. I’m afraid I have no cricket to write about. Here, though, is Rory Carroll on the state of the sport in Ireland, who play England in a Test at Lord’s next week:Another update from Taunton, and it’s not good news: the rain has intensified, and play looks extremely unlikely to restart as currently scheduled in four minutes.NEWS! Tea will be taken at 3.40pm, and the umpires hope to resume play at 4pm.Looking at the forecast I’d be surprised if there’s any more play today. It looks like it’ll rain until well after 6pm, though at the moment it looks very light: there are still players on the outfield, and only a few spectators are bothering with brollies.Is is raining again in Taunton, and the proposed restart has been abandoned:Pictorial evidence of umpires inspecting the pitch at Taunton:And so it is. Play will restart in seven minutes, unless it doesn’t.Waiting for news, though unless the meteorologists are way off key, the rain is about to resume and last for about three hours. Strictly speaking it should already be raining.Here is a picture of some umpires.Geoff reports that the England players are warming up on the field, playing a bit of football. The central pitch cover is still on, but the rest have been packed away. The pitch inspection should be imminent.Hello world! So if you could send your emails and stuff here, I’d be much obliged. News from Taunton is:The outermost covers are being mopped up by the mopping machine, and will be very gradually removed. The rain has stopped for now. But we’ll still be a fair way away from any action. Given the lull continues, perhaps now is as good a time as any for us to hand over the rainy baton. Simon Burnton will let you know if there’s any further play, with Australia well on top in the match and England’s hopes of a win disappearing by the minute. I think the rain has stopped. Yes, here come a few groundsmen, popping their little heads up like tulips in the spring. They like to stand around the pitch cover and chat. It’s an important part of the process. In the meantime, I’ve been busy rewatching the Soweto Gospel Choir singing Bluey.Still raining, though it’s lighter. I’d guess that with the less bountiful resources for the ground staff here, we’d take an hour to get a restart even if the rain stops. The time is 13:53 BST! Exciting.If Harkarn Sumal prayed as indicated, then it worked. But somehow I think Harkarn came to a different conclusion by the end of this letter.“Okay, I’ll do it. I’ll break the emergency glass, unfurl the scroll of parchment that sits behind it, and read the old words aloud. ‘Is it cowardly to pray for rain?’ Not to give us a sneaky boost in our search for a draw that would clinch the Ashes, which was the hope when the words were first written 14 long years ago, but to avoid the fully warranted pasting that we’re going to get here. The absolute state of this game. If the weather holds out, I see a declaration about an hour before the close today. Then our shell-shocked top order will have to traipse out and show some real gumption. We’re already playing for pride now as far as I can see. Still, it’s red ball cricket, and a good chance to measure where we stand in the grand scheme of things when there’s nowhere to hide.”Very sorry that I missed this perverse missive earlier.“Got to say, given how unenjoyable this is, I’m really enjoying it. So much of women’s sport seems to have to combine the contest itself with trying to promote the brand. Great we have reached a point where the Aussies can just grind out a huge total without having to think about the wider effects. I’d like to see them declare at about 6-550 before lunch tomorrow, Perry 276 not out. Old skool, Bill Lawry sort of stuff.”Oh, Peter Salmon. Always swimming against the current.We’ve had a bit of an email glitch this morning, so I didn’t receive a bunch of emails in the first session. Apologies for that. I’ll sort through a few now.First, Romeo. Not just a famous romantic lead (too obvious) but a very fun song by Basement Jaxx. (Also in an English cricket connection the album it was on is named Rooty.)Anyway, Romeo says, “Do you think I would be safe in saying Ellyse Perry is one of the greatest of all time?”Well, yes. Because when you talk about all-rounders, you talk about someone who could hold their place in a team on either discipline. But where someone like Jacques Kallis may have done that as a third or fourth seamer, he wouldn’t have been the first. The greats of the 1980s –Imran, Hadlee, Kapil – tended to be great bowlers who were good batsmen. Perhaps good batsmen with great moments.But aside from Garfield Sobers, I can’t think of anyone who was genuinely in the conversation for the very best in the world, at least in the best three or four, in both disciplines at the same time.Maybe Keith Miller was? Maybe Botham for a hot minute, but his batting was usually more revelatory than dependable. Maybe a few of the pioneers of the late 1800s. Maybe Unaarrimin in the 1860s and 1870s. But very few.I regret to inform you that it’s now hammering down rain at the ground in Taunton. Heavy and looking set-in. We’ll keep you updated but any return to play will be at the least delayed by a fair margin.The juggernaut rolls (very, very slowly) on. This is the steamroller scene from Austin Powers. In whites.“A side that is reaping the benefits of professional development and most importantly backing from the top rung of the ladder: CA and its various corporate sponsors versus a side made up of fellow professionals... but that’s where the similarities stop, don’t they. “This is not a put down of English women’s cricket but a fervent wish that the ECB via its commercial sponsors and media obligations can and should do more to support the game. That can surely financially support more than 15 women who make up the squad that is currently selected. The money needs to go out to the counties and to those players who sacrifice far more in some circumstances than their counterparts in the men’s game.“No DRS in an Ashes Test? Surely we could pass the hat around to pay for it. Ridiculous it’s not there.”132nd over: Australia 341-5 (Mooney 7, Jonassen 4) Mooney trying to repeat the dose against Gordon, as the clock ticks down. Defending from the crease. Two short legs and a slip in place. Lots of chatter on the field. Trying to dial up the pressure. But they may as well dial up some take-away. Mooney does it comfortably, and the umpires tip the bails off. Lunch time!And a suggestion that Haynes may have got an edge on the ball that got her out. Which leads into an email from Lee Henderson...131st over: Australia 341-5 (Mooney 7, Jonassen 4) Marsh to Mooney, who is trying just to get through to lunch, blocking out an over bar one single.130th over: Australia 340-5 (Mooney 6, Jonassen 4) Why would send Jess Jonassen in ahead of your debutantes? Surely the best plan would be to get them a hit, plus someone like Gardner could boost the total quickly? Not that JJ doesn’t deserve a chance to have a hit: I was there in 2015 for her 99 at Canterbury and it was an absolute gem of an innings. But still... the indications here are that Australia will just bat until they’re bowled out. Which could be tomorrow. Jonassen will give some entertainment before then though, starting with an advance and a gorgeous cover drive from Gordon for four.129th over: Australia 335-5 (Mooney 5) Gone, last ball of the over. Finally the other Australian sentinel falls, and it’s another near miss for Rachael Haynes on the hunt for a Test hundred. Simple enough dismissal: shapes to sweep, misses, straightens down the line, hit in front. 128th over: Australia 333-4 (Haynes 86, Mooney 4) Just a single from Gordon, and it’s a triple Nelson score for Australia.127th over: Australia 332-4 (Haynes 85, Mooney 4) One of the other considerations with women’s Tests being so few is that it can affect the tactics. Say you’re the Australian captain. You have Ash Gardner and Sophie Molineux on debut. If you declare now, they may not even get the chance to bat in their first and possibly only Test match. England could collapse twice, or rain could mean Australia don’t bat again. So do you bat on to give them the experience? Hard not to, when you don’t actually need to win the match.Mooney adds three runs with a nice cut from Marsh. Good cricket, good save on the rope. 126th over: Australia 328-4 (Haynes 84, Mooney 1) It will be interesting to see how Mooney plays. She opens in the WBBL and is an attacking type, but one of the many drawbacks of playing so few Test matches is that there’s a huge amount riding on each innings when these women go out to bat. They know that one mistake here and you’ll be waiting two and a half years for the chance to even be picked in the next team. So it can obviously make players go into their shells. Haynes also wants to make sure that 98 doesn’t remain her highest Test score. She advances to Gordon to lift four over mid-on. Mooney nudges a single to open her account."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2b7a0d0b09f7799f6aff732c2504e8e13403524/548_224_2604_1562/master/2604.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0028683a3175cf7fe3a48791b0bc13c3","title":"the open golf 2019 day two portrush live","story":"Rory isn’t the only man on the march, though. Xander Schauffele was one of the pre-tournament favourites, and no wonder, because the 25-year-old Californian’s record in the majors isn’t too dissimilar from Brooks Koepka’s at a similar age. In other words: something’s afoot, and it might just be a matter of time. He carded a shockingly poor 75 yesterday, but he’s wheeching back up the standings apace. Birdies at 7 and 8, an eagle at 12, and now another birdie at 15. He’s -2 ... and only six off the lead! If he can pick up another shot or two, he’ll really fancy his chances going into the weekend. He’ll still be confident if he can par his way home, but you get the point.Thanks Niall. Well, the end to Dylan Frittelli’s round was a bit of an anti-climax. That 6-5 finish turned a very fine round into a still-decent 69. But plenty of good work was undone at the death. He’s -5. Meanwhile the Rory revival continues apace. After blootering a monster drive down 12, he only needed a gap wedge into the par-five green. He sends his ball over the flag, and though it doesn’t spin back much, he’s got a 20-footer left for eagle. If that goes in, things are going to get very real quite soon.Ah, unlucky for Frittelli, who leaves himself a monster uphill putt for par – and rolls it to the very edge of the cup! Ultimately, it’s another bogey, and the South African drops down to a share of eighth place. And with that, I’ll hand you back to Scott...It could have been worse, but this is an awkward lie for Frittelli. The ball is on a bank, surrounded by long grass. He digs his approach shot into the roll-off area behind the final green. Could’ve been worse. McIlroy tees off at the par-five 12th, and creams his shot right-to-left, dodging a couple of big bunkers and finding the fairway.Another birdie for McIlroy! He can make this game look so easy, and so difficult, depending on his mood. Two birdies to begin the back nine – he probably needs another three to make the cut. Off the final tee, Frittelli lets out a yelp of frustration as another shot careens into the rough.Too much for Frittelli to do on the 17th, and he has to settle for a double bogey and a drop down the leaderboard. On the 14th, Henrik Stenson pushes his par putt within an inch, but will slip back to -3, his chances of creeping to the top of the leaderboard fading.Frittelli is in a spot of bother on the 17th, losing his ball off the first tee shot, and landing the second in the rough! His fourth shot on the par four is steered tidily onto the green, so he may escape with just a bogey – but will lose his share of the lead. Meanwhile the defending champion, Francesco Molinari, drains a birdie at the 11th and is now even, and looking good to make the cut.Rory’s comeback continues! He notches a birdie on the 10th, and is back down to five over. The cut will be +1, maybe +2, so there’s still work to do to sneak into the weekend.A few words from Shane Lowry: “I had a great time today. I was pinching myself out there - the crowds were fantastic, it was a day to remember. I birdied the first two, and the first tee shot set me up … I knew the rain was coming in later, so I had to make a good start.“Obviously I’m disappointed with the end, but I’m in a great position and looking forward to tomorrow. I’m playing well, I feel like my game’s where it needs to be. There’ll be pressure, times I’ll get out of position, but next week I’ll be in Memphis, with two men and a dog watching, so I’m happy having a big Irish crowd roaring me on!”Can Dylan Frittelli grab the outright lead? As Scott mentioned earlier, he only grabbed a place in the field by winning the John Deere Classic last week. At the 16th, he rattles in a par putt from eight feet to stay level with Holmes and Lowry.An errant approach shot leaves Lowry with just too much to do, and he sends his par putt inches wide. He joins JB Holmes on eight under in the clubhouse, but might feel a touch disappointed not to have the outright lead.Shane Lowry heads to the 18th green, and gets a rapturous reception from the Portrush faithful. Mickelson finishes with a long-range birdie, trimming his score to eight over, still a long old way from the cut.Thanks Scott, and hello everyone. Here’s a stat to kick things off – this is the 83rd major where Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson have both started – and will be the first time they both fail to make the cut. They’ll always have Vegas.Yep, Dylan Frittelli is in form all right. His sends his second at 15 to six feet, then makes his fifth birdie of the day. He’s one off the top, the lead still held by Shane Lowry after he clipped a crisp chip up the bank, nearly holing out for an outrageous birdie. Par will do.And with that, I’m off to grease my pan with a couple of rashers. Back in a wee while, but in the meantime, Niall McVeigh is, like a pint of plain, your only man.Lowry takes his sweet time to plan his second shot. If you squinted you could be forgiven for thinking you were watching the notoriously snail-paced JB Holmes in action. Though he is leading the Open, to be fair. Finally he takes his shot ... and sends a big one booming through the green and over the back. He’ll have a tricky up and down from the bottom of a bank. Meanwhile up on 18, Andrew Putnam makes par, and signs for a round of 67. One eagle, two birdies, no bogeys. After a tie for fourth at last week’s Scottish Open, he is, like Dylan Frittelli, a man in form. He’s -5. Lowry’s tee shot has landed near the 18th tee. He’ll get relief from some spectator barriers, and will take his drop on grass trampled flat by the punters. He’s 130 yards from the green. A huge break. So having said that, the leader does still seem a little flustered. He sends a hysterical slice into the punters down the right of 17, then starts effin’ and jeffin’ in the lyrical style. He’s in the lap of the gods there, because it looked as though that drive caromed off some poor bugger’s noggin, and it could have gone anywhere.Another extremely staunch par save by Shane Lowry! His chip out of the cabbage isn’t particularly good, running hot, five feet past. This is more missable than the one he didn’t make at 14 ... but he guides this one in. Nerves of steel. He remains a shot clear of JB Holmes, at -9.The defending champion Francesco Molinari was wandering around with a face on. A three-over-par 74 yesterday, and pars through the first six holes today. At which point his caddy told him to snap out of his funk and get his chin up. That’s some fine psychology, because since then Molinari has carded back-to-back birdies, the latest the result of a lovely approach to kick-in distance at 8. He’s +1, and while hopes of becoming the first player to retain this title since Padraig Harrington in 2008 look extremely unlikely, he’s moving in the right direction and is now above the cut line.Lowry just wants to get back to the clubhouse. His early-round mojo has deserted him. His tee shot into the par-three 16th, Calamity, snags in the rough to the right of the green. It’s not a total disaster, as he’s not miles from the flag and only just in the long stuff. But there’s still work to do if he’s to get up and down for his par.OK, these are crucial moments for Shane Lowry. He’s coming off bogey at 14, and has pulled his approach at 15 into greenside sand. There’s not a lot of green to play with. From wet sand, so badly raked that he complains to the referee, Lowry flops out delicately to three feet. That’s a fine result from where he’d found himself, and it salvages his par. It would have been easy for the head to go there, but Lowry composed himself brilliantly. Meanwhile another birdie for Rory McIlroy, this time at 7. He’s +6 ... and if the cut moves out to +2, you never know, he could make the weekend yet.Dylan Frittelli sends his tee shot at 13 pin high, albeit a good 30 feet to the left of the flag. A little bit more oomph, and the birdie putt would have dropped, but it’s just a par and he remains two off the lead at -7. Earlier today - at 12.47pm to be precise - we discussed the last bearded winner of the Open. Frittelli is sporting some very hip eye glasses. So should he win, the question will need to be asked: who was the last Open champion to sport specs? Ian Baker-Finch, is who, back in 1991. The sunglasses worn by David Duval (2001) don’t count. Lowry’s first putt across the 14th lacks a little pace. He’s left himself with a testing five-footer for his par. And it’s a costly mistake, as he sends his putt to the right, expecting a kink back left that never comes. His first bogey of the day. Meanwhile Frittelli is an inch away from rolling in an eagle putt at 12. He kicks in for birdie that brings him to within two shots of the lead.Lowry’s drive at 14 isn’t all that, sneaking off the fairway and into the rough on the left. But he thrashes an approach into the heart of the green nonetheless. He’ll not be expecting to make birdie from where he is, but he’d have taken this outcome when he was observing his ball arcing towards the cabbage from the tee box.A par for the Irish amateur James Sugrue up the last. He signs for a second-round 73. That’s put him at +2, currently just outside the cut. A triple-bogey seven at 14 may have cost him. But it may not. There’s a fair chance the cut will move out to +2, in which case Sugrue and his fellow amateur, Takumi Kanaya of Japan, also at +2, will battle it out over the weekend for the silver medal. Fingers crossed. But sadly Darren Clarke won’t be there. He leaves a long bogey putt short, then shoves the double-bogey effort right of the hole. A dreadful miss that causes audible shock in the stands ... because at +3, the 2011 champion and Royal Portrush member won’t be teeing it up this weekend. He storms off to the scorer’s hut, clearly upset, desperate to get out of here.Henrik Stenson snatches at a short par putt on 8. He slips back to -2. McIlroy misses a short birdie putt at 5, and his dreams of a sensational salvage job are beginning to look very wild. He remains at +7. But how about this from Dylan Frittelli?! The 29-year-old from South Africa was the last man to grab a place at this Open, winning the John Deere last weekend. And he’s taken that good form to County Antrim. A 68 yesterday, and he’s on course for a similar round today. Birdie at 2 has been followed up by back-to-back birdies at 10 and 11. He’s -6, currently in a tie for fifth. Lowry’s birdie effort is always missing on the high side. Another par. His upward momentum has slowed. But there are worse places to tread water than two clear at the top of the famous yellow Open scoreboard. He remains at -10. Grace converts his birdie chance, though, deserved reward for his wonderful tee shot.Branden Grace is this close to becoming the second player, after Emiliano Grillo yesterday, to make a hole-in-one at 13. But instead of bounding straight into the cup, it takes a little kick off to the left. He’s left with a three-footer for birdie. His effort makes Shane Lowry’s most acceptable tee shot, landed softly 12 feet from the flag, look completely average by comparison. Birdie chance coming up, though!A nice steady start for the 2016 champion Henrik Stenson. He follows up birdie at 3 with another at the par-five 7th. He’s -3 and will be revving up for a leaderboard charge, weather permitting. It’s still a little drizzly, but the wind’s not a huge factor, so all’s well at the moment. Time to reflect on the big picture.Lowry’s putt teases the gallery, briefly looking like it’s heading straight in. But it soon slides off to the left. A tap-in for par, and at -10 he remains two clear of the clubhouse leader JB Holmes. But this is statistically the easiest hole on the course today - it’s offered up three eagles and 51 birdies so far - and that’s an opportunity to extend his lead passed by. The approach to blame.Lowry does extremely well to fire a bump-and-run out of the thicket, up and onto the green. The ball even bites a little as it threatens to roll hysterically past the hole. He’ll have a look at birdie from 15 feet coming back. Back on 4, McIlroy lands his second 12 feet behind the hole, but his putt, a left-to-right curler, simply refuses to take the last turn. He remains at +7.A little bit of trouble for the leader at 12. Lowry’s drive was perfect, in the middle of the fairway, but he’s pulled his second into some mutant curly kale down the left. Par should be eminently makeable from there, as he’s got plenty of green to play with, though much will depend on the lie.As Lowry tees it up on the par-five 12th, Andrew Putnam shows the leader what to do up on the green. He creams his approach to six feet, then strokes in for an eagle. Throw in birdies at 1 and 10, and the 30-year-old from Washington state is going along very nicely at -5. Meanwhile his compatriot Kevin Streelman shot a miserable six-over 77 yesterday. So he’s responded today with a six-under 65, matching Justin Harding’s best round of the week. He’s level par going into the weekend. Something for Rory to chew on, then ... and he responds by holing a tramliner across 3 for a rare birdie. He’s +7 and won’t be giving up the ghost quite yet, despite it all.Branden Grace had amused the crowd on 10 when he theatrically milked some applause for a birdie, knowing full well the gallery is only really concerned with the antics of Shane Lowry. All in good humour. He doesn’t hit a 15-footer on 11, though, spurning the chance of back-to-back birdies. He remains at -2. His partner Lowry was a little tentative with his longer birdie effort, as well, though he tidies up for par without too much drama. He’s still two clear at -10.Lowry’s wedge into 11 briefly threatens to bound into the thick rough behind the green, but bites hard on its second bounce and spins back onto the fringe. He’ll putt from there, and will have half a chance of birdie. That’s the currency McIlroy needs to deal in, if he’s to somehow save himself in one of the great feats of golfing escapology. So par on the relatively easy par-five 2nd doesn’t go down so well. A grim look on his face. The super-fast start he’ll have desired has eluded him.The weather’s improving. The wind’s dropped again, and while it’s still raining, it’s not quite as heavy as it was. Lowry whistles a fine drive down the left of the 11th fairway, clearly not of a mood to take his foot off the gas. Elsewhere, Matthew Fitzpatrick has hit the turn in a blemish-free 33 strokes, after making birdies at 2, 4 and 7. He’s -3 and 2013’s low amateur is on the rise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0e0a68e76296f736fa3566c31686204c17aafb5/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f02827d83726bc67d2429dc7edea804","title":"tour de france 2019 individual time trial on stage 13 and la course live","story":"The French maillot jaune increased his lead with a victory in the Inidual Time Trial that was as emphatic as it was surprisingHere’s today’s report on what could prove to be a crucial stage. Jeremy Whittle’s report with follow later. Wout van Aert update: It was a very bad day indeed for the young Belgian, who won a sprint finish earlier this week. He suffered a sickening crash into a barrier after misjudging a turn and has been taken to hospital. “According to French TV, Van Aert has a deep cut on his leg but no fractures,” writes Matt Cast. There was late heartbreak for Thomas De Gendt on a day when Julian Alaphilippe stoke the show. Geraint Thomas, Steven Kruijswijk, Enric Mas and Egan Bernal all had good days. For Dan Martin, Nairo Quintana and Jakob Fugslang, it was an afternoon of frustration.Julian Alaphilippe increases his lead. On a day many thought Julian Philippe might lose the yellow jersey or at least a considerable chunk of his lead, he has increased his lead on General Classification ahead of tomorrow’s jaunt up the Tourmalet. The Frenchman is roared home by the locals of Pau and wins the stage by a scarcely credible 14 seconds. What! A! Performance! Geraint Thomas: The Welshman takes the lead, finishing the course 21 seconds quicker than Thomas De Gendt. Egan Bernal: The Colombian Ineos rider finishes over a minute in arrears. Julian Alaphilippe: The Frenchman in the yellow jersey is doing the garment proud on this, the day of it’s 100th anniversary. He’s five seconds quicker than Geraint Thomas at the third split.Steven Kruijswijk: A fine ride from the Dutchman, who is nine seconds slower than our clubhouse leader. That could move him up to third on GC.  Geraint Thomas: The Welshman is quickest at the third split, the 21.9km mark, stopping the clock at 28min 40sec. That’s 21 seconds faster than TDG, who must be shifting nervously in his stage leader’s throne. Enrique Mas: Alaphilippe’s team-mate puts in a good shift, finishing 22 seconds off the pace. Adam Yates: The Mitchelton Scott team leader finishes the course, 1min 32sec down on the leader. Nairo Quintana: The Movistar rider finishes the course 1min 15sec down on Thomas De Gendt. Julian Alaphilippe: The maillot jaune hits the second split and it’s an incredible team from Julian Alaphilippe. He gets there six seconds quicker than Thomas. His time: 21min 48sec. Geraint Thomas: The defending champion obliterates Kruijswijk’s time at the 15.5km mark, taking 13 seconds out of the Dutchman. He stops the clock at 21min 54sec. Steven Kruijswijk: The Dutchman is quickest at the second split: 22min 07sec. That’s five seconds quicker than De Gendt. Thibaut Pinot: The Frenchman, in 10th place on GC, hits the final ramp and is going to post a good time. The clock goes from green to red and Pinot finishes 13 seconds off the pace set by De Gendt. That’s a good effort. Rigoberto Uran: Thomas De Gendt is seen grimacing nervously in the Big Chair, as Rigoberto Uran crosses the finish line. He’s not quite quick enough, but less than one third of a second slower than the stage leader. Julian Alaphilippe: Taking adsvantage of the superpowers he appears to glean from the yellow jersey, Julian Alaphilippe is quickest past the first check point: 11min 17sec. Chapeau. Steven Kruijswijk: The Jumbo-Visma rider clocks the fastest time at the first check point: 11min 22sec. Geraint Thomas takes a second longer to get there.Nairo Quintana: At the same point, Nairo Quintana is 40 seconds down. Team Ineos rider Egan Bernal hits the 7.7km check point 12 seconds down on De Gendt.Dan Martin is struggling. In ninth place on GC this morning, the UAE Team Emirates rider has lost over a minute at the 15.5km time check. Thibaut Pinot is rocking and rolling. At the second time check, he clocks 22min 25sec. De Gendt got there 13 seconds quicker. Thomas De Gendt leads the stage. Richie Porte has just muscled his way into second position, while Kasper Asgreen is in third. The time to beat is 35min 36sec.

We talk to five Sri Lankans, whose livelihoods depend on visitors, about hardship, recovery and hopeMay and June are the low season in Sri Lanka, but this year, following the Easter Sunday bombings, tourism ground to a halt. Hotels were empty, beaches were deserted and popular attractions that had been starting to suffer from overtourism were eerily quiet. The UK Foreign Office’s warning against all but essential travel was issued on April 25, effectively forcing UK holidaymakers to either cancel or postpone bookings.“We had four yoga groups in May and June – they all had to cancel,” says Kevin Abbott, owner of Jim’s Farm Villas in central Sri Lanka. “We effectively closed the hotel. Last weekend we had our first guests since the attack.”In some ways people employed by hotels have been more fortunate than many other Sri Lankans who rely on tourism for their livelihoods. Most luxury hotels kept their staff on, albeit on lower wages. “Instead of laying associates off, we decided to speak to all of them immediately after the attack, and instructed all the managers to focus on training and developing their skills in order to prepare for the regular flow of tourists in time to come,” says Hashan Cooray, marketing director of Jetwing Hotels.But thousands tuktuk drivers, guides, souvenir and food sellers who are dependent on tourist spending saw their income disappear overnight.Now, says Sennema, bookings are “improving much faster than expected” and the company has been able to give drivers an interest-free loan to get their vehicles back. This week in London, the Sri Lanka Tourism Alliance, a group of over 160 hoteliers and tour operators, launched a campaign to revive tourism to the country. So far much of the publicity has focused on deals and the fact that tourists will have some of the country’s biggest sights to themselves. But, for Sam Clark, founder of Experience Travel Group and a co-founder of the Sri Lanka Tourism Alliance, the greatest benefit to travellers going now is the knowledge that their trip will have a direct and significant impact on local lives.“By returning to Sri Lanka and experiencing the country, it is ordinary Sri Lankans that you are helping most: your spending money goes much further, much faster than you might imagine. Just your presence in the country is taken as an endorsement of their efforts to recover,” says Clark.Our local writer spoke to five Sri Lankans about their experience in the past three months and their hopes for the coming months.Isabel ChoatAnjula has worked as a freelance chauffeur-guide for the last seven years. It can be a good career: in the past, during the high season from Christmas to April, he would take home 300,000 Sri Lankan rupees a month (£1,370-£1,600). Most chauffeur-guides maintain their own vehicles, though many have staggeringly high monthly loans to repay, meaning they have to work a set number of days just to break even. For Anjula, this equates to £92 a month: manageable when work is good, as it has been for the last few years, but a problem when work dries up. Other drivers are dogged by much bigger loans, someover £460 a month, showing a blind determination to succeed in an industry that has grown exponentially over the last decade, since the end of the 26-year civil war in 2009.Anjula usually prepares for the quieter season (May to October) by keeping money aside to tide him over, but with no idea when bookings will pick up again, he has decided to sell his car.“I’m considering going to work in Dubai for a year or two, until tourism picks up again here,” he says. “I got married last year and we’ve decided to wait until things are settled before having children.” It’s a common theme, and local travel companies reliant on their drivers are keen to keep them. A knowledgable and amiable chauffeur-guide can help make a holiday. .Despite everything, Anjula considers himself lucky. He lives less than a mile from St Sebastian’s Church in Negombo, where he usually attends mass – and where more than 100 people died in the worst of the Easter Sunday terror attacks. He overslept that morning. Had he not, he and his wife would probably have been among the casualties.For those passionate about wildlife, Sri Lanka is a place of great ersity, where leopard, sloth bears and elephants reside within 22 protected national parks. The attraction of higher-than-average earnings has lured some into safari-guiding, despite not having – nor, incredibly, needing – any formal wildlife training. But some parks are now oversubscribed, and the recent loss of business has left many in the industry reeling.Jeep driver Ruwan lives near Udawalawe national park, a southern reserve with a vast reservoir backed by the mist-laden mountains of the Hill Country. Elephants are part of life here: for some this is a blessing, as this is one of the best places in Sri Lanka to see them in the wild for others they are pests that stray into farmland and destroy or consume crops.More than 400 jeeps are registered with the park, so it helps that Ruwan has been the go-to driver for new safari lodge Camp Hasthi, which opened last year. He also helps in the camp, which has four permanent tents with attached toilets and solar power, plus gardens of vegetables and mangos. Community-orientated, the camp’s owners employ local villagers like Ruwan and source fish and fresh produce from local suppliers. As the sole breadwinner in the family –supporting his wife, three-month-old son, parents and mother-in-law – Ruwan was earning a “comfortable” average of £185 a month doing a job he loved.After the attacks, Ruwan started working as a labourer to make ends meet, and eventually, with Camp Hasthi’s help, purchased a plough. He was also fortunate to have his father’s four-acres of land to fall back on. Having neglected it in favour of jeep driving, it’s now newly ploughed and seeded, and he hopes it will earn a profit when it’s harvested next year. Ruwan has learned a valuable lesson, too, and vows to keep it going even when the tourists return.With Colombo the focus of the Easter attacks, stays in the capital were quickly scrapped from visitors’ itineraries. Parks and promenades, shopping centres and dining quarters fell silent in the weeks following. Colombo resident Mark Forbes (a Dutch Burgher), founder of Colombo City Walks, received many cancellations.He was also unable to honour the walk requests that did come in since access to the colonial-era Fort, focus of his most popular walks, was in an out-of-bounds high-security zone. Another of his key neighbourhoods, the Pettah, a multi-ethnic maze of streets selling wholesale items such as electronics and haberdashery to the entire country, had also fallen quiet.Security in Colombo has often been tight as a result of the civil war, however its renaissance since hostilities ceased has been astounding. Health-food cafes, rooftop bars, jogging tracks, restaurant districts, contemporary art galleries and high-rise condos and shopping centres have transformed it into a modern city.Visitors combine Mark’s three-hour morning or afternoon walks with shopping in Barefoot or Paradise Road, and a meal in the Ministry of Crab, a restaurant within the sensitively renovated Old Dutch Hospital in Fort. Offering twice-daily walks, including hosting groups from passing cruise ships, Mark’s team has grown to four.Since the beginning of July, Mark has noticed a dramatic increase in enquiries compared with May and June. Security is less tight around Fort and cordoned-off areas have reopened. Footfall is increasing in public areas and vendors working in the Pettah have mostly returned. Mark is feeling positive that resilient Colombo will soon return to form.For 30 years Ratnasiri has been strolling the curve of Unawatuna beach, not far from the former Dutch colonial city of Galle, on the south-west coast, selling souvenirs to tourists from a black holdall. With his hands clutching a hand-hewn elephant, a stilt fishermen and a cascade of garishly painted key tag masks – all common souvenirs – he tells me some of his most successful days as a vendor were during the civil war, when souvenir shops – which now line the road uninterrupted into Unawatuna – were few and far between.Ratnasiri used to carve many items by hand but now just makes the key tags and buys the rest from wholesalers.Ratnasiri lives with his wife in Galle, though he didn’t bother making the 15km round-trip to Unawatuna in the eight weeks following the attacks, as the beach was deserted. During the high-season, Ratnasiri might take home £12 to £14 a day, though the fall in visitor numbers means he’s earned very little in the past few months, and things are uncertain this year. Yet Ratnasiri remains upbeat.He tells me he survived the after-effects of the 2004 tsunami and has noticed more tourists in recent weeks. “It’s peaceful, isn’t it?” he asks, rhetorically, as his eyes dart around the formerly heaving beach seeking out the handful of potential customers wading in and out of an ocean that’s calm and vibrantly blue.At home in Sri Lanka’s hills, nature reserves and most-untouched regions, Sidantha (Sid) has been working in the tourist industry for more than 15 years. Finding the corporate world a bad fit for his adventurous spirit, Sid found refuge in Walpolamulla, a tiny hamlet only accessible on foot, deep within the Knuckles, a vast mountainous forest conservation area to the north-east of Kandy. Taken in by his “non-biological grandparents”, he found the solace and simplicity of life in this cut-off region so inspiring that when elephants finally forced them from their home, and down into the nearest village, he revived it as a homestay for his small eco-tourism, profit-sharing venture, Abode Tours.Unlike most village experiences in Sri Lanka, residents here live a self-sustaining life, devoid of TVs, 4G and wifi, and unaffected by outside events – so much so that tourism revenue is supplementary, rather than integral to their income. So as not to upset the balance of local life, Sid sends just a small number of “travel-hardened” guests there a year, combining the visits with other less-visited areas, such as Gal Oya national park and north-westerly Mannar, where Sid has another homestay, Hibernate, looked after by a Tamil-Hindu family in the fishing and toddy-tapping (palm wine) trades.While his beneficiaries aren’t reliant on tourism, Sid has had to contend with cancellations since the Easter attacks. He’s had to put off or cancel projects as there’s not much “in the kitty” to do the usual upgrades and repairs, though he worries about the suppliers he’s let down. Keen to focus his energies on Abode and Hibernate, he remains dedicated to promoting sustainable tourism in Sri Lanka.

The institute said the quake struck at 2.13pm local time, about 14 miles north of Athens.The quake caused limited power cuts and communication problems around the capital the fire brigade received calls about people trapped in lifts.The quake, which was caught live in the studios of the state broadcaster, ERT, caused damage to the bell tower of the Pantanassa church in Monastiraki Square in Athens.The Civil Protection Authority said there was no immediate word on injuries or damage.The most powerful quake to hit Athens in the past 20 years occurred in 1999, when a 6.0-magnitude temblor caused extensive damage and killed more than 140 people.Gerasimos Papadopoulos, a senior seismologist at the Geodynamics Institute, said Friday’s quake was felt across southern Greece. “It had a very shallow depth and that’s why it was felt so strongly,” he said.“It is too early to say whether this was the main earthquake, but there have been aftershocks of magnitude 3.5, 2.5 and 3.2 – and that is encouraging.

Ancient English woodland tumbles towards the broad river valley. The birds sing, the squirrels scurry.Then suddenly the mood changes as a bear ambles mightily into sight among the oak trees. Another clambers up a towering ash and seems to take in the view down to the River Severn and and across towards the Forest of Dean.Soon these Eurasian brown bears will be joined by a pack of Eurasian grey wolves and the two species will coexist – hopefully peacefully – in this corner of northern Europe for the first time in more than 1,000 years.This is not an ambitious rewilding scheme but a project run by the Bristol Zoological Society to offer a glimpse into what ancient British woodland was like before humans cleared the forests to make room for homes and farms and exterminated some of the spectacular creatures that lived there.The sight of bears and wolves together in one large enclosure will thrill visitors to Bear Wood within Bristol zoo’s Wild Place project but it is also designed to be thought-provoking – why did our ancestors think it acceptable to wipe out the bear and wolf and could we live with them again in the future?Dr Christoph Schwitzer, the chief zoological officer, is pleased that even before next week’s public opening, Bear Wood is provoking such debate. The zoo is proud of its conservation projects that range from trying to bolster gorilla populations in central Africa to reintroducing white-clawed crayfish to the UK.Schwitzer believes there is also a good argument for reintroducing larger creatures such as lynx to remote areas such as the Scottish highlands. “That may be worth trying. A population of 300 or 400 lynx might be viable,” he said.But bears and wolves in England? “That’s a lot more tricky. There are a lot of factors you need to consider, the first being that we are a heavily populated country.” And human behaviour has not changed over the centuries. “People would still go out and kill them,” he said.The opinion is not just theoretical. When a bear nicknamed Bruno wandered into German in 2006 he lasted only seven weeks before being shot by hunters. “People were so scared of it they couldn’t live with it,” said Schwitzer.All of which makes Bear Wood a bittersweet sort of place.As well as wolves and bears, wolverines and lynx are to be found in Bear Wood. They are in separate enclosures so will not come face to face with the larger animals, though they will smell and hear them.The wolverine is a member of the mustelid family that includes badgers, weasels and otters. It too once roamed British woodland before disappearing, presumably hunted for its fur and meat. A handful of wolverine bones have been found in Britain, more than half of them in south-west England and south Wales.Lynx vanished after the wolverine as woodland was chopped down, and next it was the turn of the bear to disappear. Quite when native British bears became extinct is not known. Bears were a familiar sight in Roman and medieval times but they may have been imported.Introducing the bears and wolves to each other will be a delicate process. “You have to observe rules,” said Schwitzer. “You can’t just throw them in together.”At first the five wolves will be brought into a separate enclosure next to the large one where the four bears are currently roaming so the two species can get used to one another.When the keepers judge the time is right the wolves will be allowed into the joint enclosure, though they will be able to retreat without the bears following them if they feel the need.“Conflict arises around prey or offspring,” said Schwitzer. So they will feed separately. The three male bears are to be castrated and the five wolves are all males so there will be no breeding and so no young to fight over.The fact that the bears and wolves have a 10,000 sq metre wooded paddock to share should help. They can keep away from each other if they want and interact if the mood takes them.Scientists will also be interested to find out what impact they have on the woodland. “We’ll be able to see how they change the flora and fauna,” said Schwitzer. The squirrels are likely to flee and the bears may clear vegetation, allowing more light-loving plants into the woods. Different invertebrates may move in.It will also be interesting to see how the bears and wolves operate as summer gives way to autumn and winter. It is not clear whether the bears will dig themselves into a den and hibernate.Across the Severn wild boar live wild in the Forest of Dean after accidental and deliberate releases from farms, and a year ago beavers were released into a large pen in the forest as part of a project to alleviate flooding. Wild beavers have also returned to a river in Devon. They are unlikely to be joined any time soon by bears or wolves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9032bd9bcd652a22b6c655ae7f13aa3a5d3003ab/0_160_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7084848b3416a101998c898479ffb0ba","title":"could camdens climate assembly help fix democracy too","story":"At meeting of randomly selected Londoners there are differing views but a respectful toneIn an airless library in north London, 56 people are trying to help fix not one global crisis but two. There are students and builders, a civil servant, an entrepreneur, a restaurateur, a support worker. There are immigrants and retirees and even a retired immigrant.This is Britain’s first climate assembly, a randomly selected panel of local people convened by the London borough of Camden to consider what can be done to confront the climate emergency. The jurors have been assembled to listen to briefings, pose questions, assess facts, debate and discuss, and then ultimately recommend action to Camden council. The big question before them is what action the district can take to limit global heating and its impact.The hope is that the series of deliberations this summer will have a bearing not just on the climate crisis but on the crisis in democracy too. A national climate assembly is planned for Westminster this autumn and Camden is being closely watched for the dos and don’ts of this relatively new form of public engagement.“I am interested in the idea of citizens assemblies and not just for climate change,” said the local MP Keir Starmer, a Labour frontbencher. “I think they might turn out to be a way to have a different kind of political dialogue to avoid the shouty tribalism of the last few years.” Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThings take a while to get going. The opening session, something of a factfinding exercise, is held on a muggy summer night in the semi-basement rotunda of Swiss Cottage public library. The room swelters, as if to make a point. A woman wafts a fan. Facilitators urge brevity, inquiry, civility. One helpful juror draws a smiley face on a paper cup to keep a restless child amused.Climate experts such as Prof Mark Maslin, of University College London, set out the indisputable science of the climate emergency. Participants have yellow and red cards to slow him down or stop him if they get lost. (“It’s the first time I’ve ever been red-carded during a presentation,” he says later.)Not everyone finds it easy. One young woman is on the verge of walking out because progress is slow. For others it’s all a bit fast. And one juror, Neil Chappell, who works in construction, wonders who chose the experts and how they chose the facts. “The people they had talking were good at getting their agenda over but didn’t give us enough information to make informed decisions,” he said.A gulf in knowledge between jurors is exposed when they are invited to pose questions. One wondered: “How many people in Camden die from air pollution each year?”. Another asked: “Can wind farms change the direction of the wind?”But council officials are enthusiastic about the process and adamant they will act on its recommendations in a new environmental plan to be drawn up for 2020.Georgia Gould, the council leader, said she hoped the outcome would be “some concrete action that we can take forward as a council. That’s the idea of it being an open process – you are letting go of that control. There has been a complete breakdown in trust in our political system, we need to create new democratic mechanisms to break through that and this is it.”After an initial fact-finding phase, the 56 panellists get into the nitty-gritty. What is to be done? What works?A pair of local trailblazers talk through their own personal carbon “hygiene” measures: an electric car for their horticultural business rail travel for holidays meat as a treat, not a staple double glazing, solar panels, and – perhaps less convincingly – “warm” wallpaper.They even approach idling cars on the street and tell drivers to switch off their engines. “Most people respond politely,” Stephen Evans tells the audience.Campaigners and experts lay out the pros and cons of certain measures. Refitting all Camden’s buildings with greener heating such as air source heat pumps and insulation would cost at least £1.3bn. Is that a bargain or a burden? Who would pay?What about pedestrianising streets, a zero-emissions motoring zone, greening driveways, grasscrete – would that make enough of a difference? And is there any space to plant more trees? (Answer: not really.)“I think it’s very interesting but I’ve been wondering quite a bit about where it’s going to lead,” said Chris Dunham, the director of Carbon Descent, an eco-consultancy, who spoke as an expert at the sessions. “My concerns are that in the age of austerity it’s a real challenge for councils which don’t have the money or power to do the things that are needed to complete the piece.” Citizens’ assemblies have been rising to prominence since an Irish experiment in 2016 to convene randomly selected laypeople to thrash out the abortion issue broke the deadlock and paved the way for a national referendum in 2018.Camden has debated social care and its 2025 borough plan. Its climate assembly will be followed by similar exercises in Cambridge, Oxford, Sheffield, Lambeth, Devon and Hertfordshire this autumn, and a national climate assembly is also scheduled to take place. Scotland will debate its future in a citizens assembly.“In the last six months the interest in the idea has risen exponentially,” said Tim Hughes, who helped to facilitate the Camden exercise. As the director of Involve, a public participation charity, Hughes has worked on a range of assemblies. What makes them work well?“You want a good range of expertise, time and space for assembly members to reflect and reach recommendations,” he said. “You are not looking for complete consensus because that could be false consensus. You also want a good sense of where people disagree.”Debate at the six tables in the library rotunda produces plenty of disagreement but participants say it is good-natured. Rupert Cruise, who is originally from Johannesburg and has lived in Camden since 2001, said: “I think it’s fantastic. The only surprise we’ve had is that there are no climate change deniers. There are differing views on where we should focus but it’s done in a respectful tone.”Some have suggested participation in such assemblies could be made mandatory in the same way that jury service is. Simon Burall, an expert in public participation who also helped to facilitate the Camden assembly, said that may be some way off.“There is significant distrust in government already, and if you force people to be here and don’t listen to them you will alienate them even further,” he said. “If you tell them they have to come to learn how to be better citizens, they’ll feel patronised.”Still, the scope for more citizens assemblies on isive issues seems broad enough. Indeed, a rigorously instituted panel to discuss the pros and cons of leaving the EU might have been useful in the run-up to the 2016 referendum.Perhaps it might still be useful as a tool to elevate debate, restore the primacy of indisputable fact and return civility and respect to political dialogue.“For the past few years we have had two or more groups of people talking past each other, whether on Brexit or climate change,” said Starmer. “I’m supportive of the idea.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

What can this unique relationship teach us? It is difficult to describe the weight of eiderdown in a language in which the epitome of lightness is a feather. Unlike a feather’s ordered barbs arranged around a solid shaft, under a microscope, eiderdown offers a portrait of chaos: hundreds of soft threads branch out from a single point, twisting around one another. Upon each thread are countless small hooks, which allow the down to cling to itself, trapping pockets of air and warmth.When I returned from Iceland, I asked my wife to close her eyes and put her hands out. After placing a duck-size clump of down in her hands, I asked her what she felt. “Heat,” she said. She opened her eyes to find the down, a ghostly grey form, hovering above her palms, and pulled it apart. It crackled as if electrified, emitting a mild smell that reminded me of burned hair. She scrunched her hands and the down disappeared in her fingers, compressed into a ball smaller than a duckling’s bill.Over centuries, eiderdown has been treasured by those who shared their lands with the eider. The Vikings apparently filled their bedding with it, while medieval tax collectors accepted it as a means of payment. Today, its buyers are the global super-rich. In Iceland, I heard stories about Gulf royals who sleep under eiderdown in the desert, and Russian politicians whose hearts can be warmed with the gift of an eiderdown duvet.The properties of eiderdown – extreme lightness and insulation – make sense when you consider the life of its owner. The eider is a fat seabird, more penguin than duck, and many of them spend most of their lives in the Arctic Circle. Visit the Icelandic coast and you will see hundreds bobbing gregariously in the sea. Brash creatures, their boldness inspires admiration in the Icelanders. “The eider is an unsung hero, far braver than any bird of prey, which it is known to attack to protect its offspring,” one local told me.The usual story of how feathers come to fill our bedding is anything but comforting. According to trade bodies, most feathers are a byproduct of the meat industry. Less fortunate birds may have their plumage ripped out while they are still alive, a practice known as live-plucking.As I held a clump of eiderdown in my hand, however, one Icelander told me something that seemed to offer an alternative to this unsettling relationship between humans and birds. He said that the eider it once belonged to is probably still alive. Not in some dark barn, or even in an open-air enclosure, but in the wilds of the Arctic Circle.In a cafe in Ísafjörður, the pastor explained how he harvests eiderdown. As part of his parish duties, he runs a small farm, a throwback to earlier times when pastors in remote areas would survive off the land. Every June, he said, about 500 ducks arrive from the sea and waddle to his farm. Eiders do not naturally nest in such large colonies, but will congregate close to human settlements to seek shelter and protection. The ducks nest anywhere: in tyres, doorways and even houses. “I always take a lot of flags with me and I put a flag beside each nest so I will be able to find it again. Because they are incredibly camouflaged, these ducks. You can almost step on them,” he said.At night, the pastor guards the flock of eiders from their predators: seagulls, foxes and mink. “I was quite lucky in that I got interested in guns when I was just a little over 20,” he said. “It was before I started studying theology.” If he were to fall asleep, a fox would have a feast of sitting ducks. “It’s more than a financial loss, it’s also like they are depending on me. So I don’t want to let them down. I used to be a night watchman, so I have a little bit of experience staying awake.”In the middle ages, pelicans were thought to pierce their own breast to draw blood to feed their young. The mythical act was known as vulning, a Christ-like act of self-sacrifice. On the pastor’s land, the eider, too, makes herself vulnerable for her offspring, although it is down, not blood, that she draws from her breast. From this down she builds a nest for her eggs her own bare skin, freshly revealed, covers them with warmth. She sits on her eggs for some 28 days, during which she may lose a third of her body weight some mothers starve to death.The scene described by the pastor has been a common sight in Iceland for centuries. Down has been collected here probably since the arrival of Norse settlers in the ninth century. The sight of thousands of tame eiders close to human settlements astounded early European travellers in Iceland. CW Shepherd, an Englishman who visited the island of Vigur in the Westfjords in 1862, described a farm besieged by eiders: “On the ground, the house was fringed with ducks. On the turf slopes of the roof, we could see ducks and a duck sat on the door-scraper … A windmill was infested and so were all the outhouses, mounds, rocks and crevices. The ducks were everywhere.”Environmentalists, economists and ornithologists have all fallen in love with Icelandic harvesting. There is an irresistible simplicity to the relationship between the harvesters and the eiders. If a harvester cares for the ducks, more and more will come to nest, increasing the amount of down that can be gathered.In myths, fables and hagiographies, one often reads of the ability of iniduals to tame wild creatures. It is said that St Cuthbert, the seventh-century missionary who settled on the Farne Islands off the Northumbrian coast, protected and tamed eiders. (Today in Northumberland, the eider is sometimes called St Cuthbert’s or Cuddy duck.) Many of these stories were built upon embellishment or pure fantasy, but in Iceland, travellers’ accounts repeatedly confirmed the existence of this strange relationship between Icelanders and the ducks.I wanted to know how this relationship worked, how it was possible for a wild bird to behave as if it were domesticated. How did this strange tradition come about? How was it that the relationship had been preserved despite the arrival of the market? Could eiderdown harvesting teach us about our relationship with other species?Back in Ísafjörður, the pastor told me about a Japanese film crew who had made a documentary about him. For several weeks, they followed him around his farm, recording him collecting down with his children, while sidestepping nesting eiders. He appeared bemused by their attention, just as he was by mine. After all, he said, the down was only some brauð, a slice of his daily bread.The pastor’s parish lay a short drive from Ísafjörður in another fjord, Önundarfjörður. It was once reached via a winding mountain road but, since 1996, the two fjords have been connected by a vast tunnel that bores directly through the hillside. One morning, I emerged from its confines, blinded by the subarctic light, and headed to the pastor’s church to take a tour of his nesting area.Like many Lutheran parishes, the pastor’s land is among the most prized in the Westfjords. In the shadow of a steep glacial wall, his family home and church overlook a floodplain that leads to the shoreline. It was hard to conceive of a more peaceful spot for a family, yet there was an air of abandonment to the pastor’s home. Children’s toys lay scattered around on the floor and a layer of dust covered the work surfaces. The previous winter, he explained, the weather had got so bad that he and his family had to leave the parish and take an apartment in Ísafjörður. He now rarely spends any time in the house. “We were trapped here for 36 hours with no electricity, no phone,” he said. “I can’t be responsible for that.”I was late for the eiderdown season, but the pastor offered to lead me around the land and re-enact his summer ritual as he had done for the Japanese film crew. Dressed in an old Polish military uniform, he headed off across the flat plain towards the beach, hunting for any nests that he had missed. It was a still day, the silence broken only by the call of an oystercatcher, alarmed by our presence.Walking on this flat land, I felt as if I had missed out on a great gathering. All around us were hundreds of small piles of crushed mussel shells, the remnants of the eiders’ feasting, ground up by their powerful gizzards. Quartz-like, these remains had an understated beauty, glinting in the light. “In the later part, everything is going crazy,” the pastor said. “Birds and chicks running around. Arctic terns attacking all the time. It’s good to have a broomstick.”Later, as we made our way back to the church, the pastor let out a cry and pointed to a nest that he had missed during the previous gathering. Covered in moss, grass and broken eggs, it looked like a furry grey omelette or pancake. He wedged his stick under the down, easing it gently from the grass, and picked it up. Laden with seaweed, twigs and dirt, it reminded me of the contents of a vacuum cleaner, half fluff, half debris. Unlike the clean down my wife had held, it had a pungent, mouldy aroma, suggestive of the sitting duck from which it came. Looking closely, I saw the remains of several eggs caught up in the down. Rendered rubbery by rainfall, their fragments were proof of what the pastor had said he always allowed the ducklings to hatch before collecting their bedding. “Take it as a gift,” he said.Some 50 years before I visited Iceland, the Scottish writer Gavin Maxwell became momentarily possessed by Icelandic harvesting while living in Sandaig, a bay in remote western Scotland. He began to read about it and even travelled to Iceland on a research trip. Maxwell is best known for for his memoir Ring of Bright Water, which recounts his domestic life with several otters, but he also adored eiders. “Perhaps,” he mused, “it is their peculiarly uneven voices, or the way their massive bills ascend in a straight line to the top of their skulls without any ‘scoop’ in between. Or perhaps it is their curious and very inidual smell, which seems as if it could have nothing to do with a bird.”Unlike previous travel writers who described eiderdown, he dreamed of recreating the success of the Icelanders. From his cottage, he had noticed eiders nesting on a small island close to his home he counted only 30 pairs in total, but he imagined that he might turn it into a magnet for ducks. Inspired by Icelandic methods, he proposed erecting flags, wind propellers, scarecrows, artificial nesting sites, wind shelters and decoy drake eiders to attract the ducks. He concocted plans to feed the ducks with mussels and – apparently – even to entertain them with music.Maxwell wrote of harvesting in utopian terms, describing how early settlers had lured eiders with “an elaboration of fluttering flags, little wind-driven clacking propellers, and reeded wind instruments that would sigh, groan or trumpet, according to the strength of the breeze”. The Icelanders, he believed, had some sort of special ability to understand ducks that verged on the mystical. While he took copious notes on Icelandic techniques in an attempt to understand their success, he allowed that there was “a certain mystique” about the practice. “Some men,” he wrote, “seem to have ‘green fingers’ with Eiders.”When I visited the pastor, I was infused with Maxwell’s own vision of down, a contrast to stories of degradation and exploitation. Patient and sensitive, the pastor seemed to fit perfectly Maxwell’s vision, heroically guarding the ducks, never taking the down too early. And yet something didn’t feel quite right. In the 19th century, British, French, Scandinavian and American travellers, many of them scientists, started visiting Iceland, which was then a Danish colony. Wandering through its volcanic landscape, admiring the frames of its miniature horses and its colossal populations of eiders, or listening to the Icelandic tongue, they described Iceland in magical terms. Fed up with their descriptions of “scenes of thrilling horror, of majestic grandeur, and of heavenly beauty”, the explorer Richard Burton wrote of a condition called “Iceland on the brain”. I feared that I was falling into a similar trap, failing to write about another character in the drama.The Arctic fox – Vulpes lagopus – is the only mammal in Iceland whose presence predates the island’s settlement. Much smaller than its red cousin, the Arctic fox has miniature soft paws that are entirely covered in fur (hence its species name, which means “rabbit foot” in Latin). Perfectly adapted to the country’s varying seasons, the foxes can roam thousands of kilometres, their winter coats transforming from white to brown or even blue in the summer months.When settlers arrived with domestic animals, it was inevitable that they would clash with the Arctic fox. Fearful of the threat to livestock, farmers clubbed, trapped and later poisoned and shot them. Such was the fear of the foxes among Icelanders that a myth emerged that they had been sent by the king of Norway to punish settlers for their abandonment of their motherland. Legislation to encourage their extermination dates back to 1295, and even today each community in Iceland is obliged to hire a fox killer to visit all known dens in the area to exterminate their occupants.As I drove back from the pastor’s farm to Ísafjörður, it struck me as unlikely that the pastor, this kind man who refused to disturb an eider, was a true fox killer. Despite the military uniform, glasses and talk of guns, he never actually described killing a fox. I later asked his friend and neighbour, a long-time eider farmer, who really kills the foxes in the fjord. “I do,” he said with a smile. “The priest has never shot a single fox.”I wondered whether I had not experienced a sanitised version of down harvesting, one primed for the Japanese market. I asked around in the Westfjords, searching for the name of an effective fox killer. Again and again the same name popped up: Valdimar Gíslason. Famed throughout the Westfjords for his cunning and ruthlessness, he had raised a private army, a band of killers to protect their capital of eider ducks. Eider farmers spoke of him in hushed tones, revering him for his dedication to fox extermination.Gíslason lived in Dýrafjörður, the fjord beyond the pastor. The following week I visited him at his home, a sparsely furnished farmhouse that overlooked the fjord. His Danish wife, Edda, welcomed me in, the sound of choir music blending with the roar of an eiderdown dryer in a barn outside. A retired maths teacher, Gíslason has lived in the fjord for seven decades. Since his boyhood, he has gathered eiderdown from his land and pursued the foxes that wish to dine on his ducks. “Sixty-five years, 50 nights every spring,” he said, as if considering a mathematical problem. After so many nights of shooting, his hearing had begun to fade.The practice of poisoning or sedating eiders’ predators was once widespread in Iceland, carried out by farmers and government officials alike. Such techniques may have saved the lives of countless ducks, but they have historically proved highly destructive to the island’s ecosystem. In the early 1980s, for example, more than 4,000 ravens were killed per year under the country’s pest control programme. Worse, the disappearance of Iceland’s white-tailed eagle, which almost went extinct in the 1960s, has been attributed partly to the activities of eiderdown farmers. Although eagle numbers have now recovered, their torrid history speaks of what Andri Snær Magnason, himself an eiderdown farmer, calls the “dark side” of the eiderdown trade: however virtuous harvesters may be, they have a strong incentive to kill any species that threatens the prized bird.But there was another reason that explained Gíslason’s fondness for foxes, one I appreciated only once he brought out his notebook. Bound in red leather, it recorded the number of ducks that had come to his farm over five decades. In the early 1960s, it recorded more than 6,000 ducks, but gradually the figure began to decline. Today, Gíslason said, there are only 1,500 nests. I guessed that the foxes were to blame, but he replied that the fox was innocent it was his neighbours, his fellow hunters, who had reduced his take of eiderdown.When settlers first came to Iceland from Norway, fleeing political turmoil, they were confronted with a harsh subarctic landscape, devoid of large animals. As well as bringing their own domesticated animals and crops, settlers foraged along the island’s coastline for driftwood, molluscs, edible plants, eiderdown and beached whales. Such a windfall offered opportunities, but also potential for great conflict. Indeed, much of early Icelandic law deals specifically with harvesting rights for these scarce resources in order to avoid violence.The sagas piled on Gíslason’s shelf, those bloody tales of Iceland’s settlement period, recount how huge disputes would erupt between settlers over driftage rights, particularly over beached whales. Like the beached whale, the ducks in Gíslason’s fjord were a finite and highly valued resource any gain by a farmer in eiderdown would be offset by another’s loss. Yet it was impossible to conceive of any conflict over their down, to conjure a scene in which they ran towards the nests, turning their rifles on each other or making missiles of eider eggs. The fox had masked the competitive logic of the harvest, uniting the farmers in common cause, their quest to avert a duck massacre.I did not sense any cruelty in any of the harvesters I met, merely the simple, unsentimental coldness of a people who lived off the land, who killed or starved. All this said, part of me still preferred Maxwell’s version, his image of Icelanders with “green fingers”. Walking through the Hornstrandir reserve, the most remote area of the Westfjords, I would often see Arctic foxes patrolling the banks of rivers or the coastline, looking for birds and eggs. At night, I would listen to their high-pitched calls from my tent, my dreams populated with images of small children at play. Like the birch trees that once covered Iceland, the foxes were a reminder of what this island was like before the arrival of human settlers. To kill them was to assert a certain logic that felt at odds with the promise of eiderdown, its essential balance, and I began to hunt for places in the Westfjords that might fit Maxwell’s image.In writings on eiderdown, Æðey, a tiny island in the Westfjords peninsula, has assumed an almost pre-eminent status among nesting sites because of the vast size of its eider population. In the summer months, thousands upon thousands of eiders besiege the island, coating its grassland in brown and white hues, the sound of cooing drakes almost deafening the visitor.It took me some five hours by car to reach the pick-up point to Æðey. A mere 15 miles (24km) of water separates it from Ísafjörður, but the coastal roads of the Westfjords wind like furled ribbons, tracing the outlines of the fjords’ fingers. Driving along them, you seem to brush your destination, only to fold back on yourself, and repeat the process.From the pick-up point, I stepped on to a small boat belonging to Alexíus Jónasson, one of Æðey’s owners. In his mid-30s, Alexíus spoke perfect English, honed from years of reading Tolkien, Clancy and the instruction manuals for fish-processing machinery from his workplace in Ísafjörður. The sixth of seven generations who have lived on Æðey, he gathers down together with his two brothers, Jonás and Magnús. But Alexíus told me that it is their mother, Katrín, who is really in charge of the down harvest, a reminder of the key role that women and family matriarchs have traditionally played in the trade, from nest to bedding.Handling the boat with expert care, Alexíus guided us across the narrow stretch of water, scattering the seabirds on its surface. As we approached the island, I could hear the cries of his children playing in the water under the gaze of his mother. “It’s nice for them to be free,” Alexíus said, before we heard a high-pitched wail. “We get the occasional argument.”I followed Alexíus as he wandered across the island. We headed onwards to the island’s lighthouse, studiously avoiding puffin nests in the fissures that riddle the island. At the island’s tip we sat down on a rock, admiring the spouts of several humpbacks, there to feed in Iceland’s rich waters after journeying from their breeding grounds in the Gulf of Mexico.Watching the whales’ spouts rise and dissolve in the distance, it was easy to believe this place a rural utopia, a place where eiders could nest in peace and children roamed alongside geese, rabbits, puffins and horses. Around us life exploded from the water, the skies and the crevices in the rocks. All one had to do was to observe it, wait patiently and gather eiderdown. But then we were met by Tása, the family dog, whose job it was to catch any mink that swim over from the mainland. “She’s a gentle family dog,” Alexíus said, “but when she meets the mink she goes apeshit. It’s quite messy when she gets it. She starts one end and breaks every bone.”The recent history of the Westfjords is really the story of rural depopulation, of a vanishing culture next to the Arctic Circle. Over the past decade, countless farmers have packed up and left the region, tired of the weather, isolation and poor roads. The region’s tunnels and bridges, intended to increase mobility, have served as escape routes, emptying the fjords of Icelanders. “The government is always making it harder for people,” Magnús said. “There’s so little money in it, being a farmer, it’s becoming a lifestyle choice.”Unlike many livestock farms in the Westfjords, eider farms are still populated, their down a source of stable income. Faced with rising costs and falling profits, the brothers stopped sheep-farming in 1990. Instead, they chose to specialise in eiderdown. “It’s like a family thing,” Alexíus said. “Everybody helps out.”While the Icelanders manage the eiders, drawing them to their dwellings with the promise of protection, the ducks had also bound the farmers to these remote corners. “It’s like the ducks are keeping us here,” Magnús told me. “We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for them.”Yet there was another presence, one that silently haunted the harvesters’ imaginations, fed by novels or television: the men and women of ambition who wore the jackets or slept under the duvets. Unlike Icelandic wool sweaters, yoghurt or finance, eiderdown has, for much of its history, been an international commodity, first traded by the Danes, then – after Iceland’s independence – bought by middlemen in Europe and Japan. Far from isolated, Iceland’s 350 eider farms are connected to distant metropolises, with an invisible thread running between the ducks, the harvesters and the buyers, much of whose wealth, no doubt, is built on a form of resource extraction that is far removed from the gentle rhythms of down-gathering.In many remote communities, cut off from urban centres by the harsh contours of landscape, stretches of water or walls of rock, encountering the global market has been a source of trauma, leading to a collapse in the old ways of living and seeing. But I felt no quake on Æðey or indeed on any of the other eider farms I visited. Every season, the ducks came, and their down was harvested and shipped off to the middlemen for a stable price, much as has been done for centuries. And yet there were signs, too, that things might be changing, as Iceland continues to be shaken by the effects of the financial crisis, the influx of millions of tourists and rural depopulation. Like the sheep farmers, the eiderdown harvesters were getting fed up with the harsh weather and isolation. Many eiderdown farms, said Jón Sveinsson, another harvester, are merely summer houses, places of recreation for city dwellers. “The new owners are not interested in the pittance a few kilograms of eiderdown give. After all, they have come to the countryside to have a beer on the porch, fire up the grill and relax on the weekend, not to run around harvesting foul-smelling, flea-ridden eiderdown.”I tried to imagine what the Westfjords might look like in 50 years or so, as old ways of life faded away. “It’s not sad,” Sveinsson told me, “just different. The world is getting smaller.” But I did feel sad, thinking that this tradition might disappear. When I returned to the UK, I made a habit of checking in department stores to see if they had eiderdown quilts or pillows. Finding them in a shop window, I always felt reassured that the traffic in down continued, that this tradition still had a place in our own century of synthetics and factory farming. Nestled in silk covers, the down was always hidden from view, its rich history condensed into a short description on the label. Tempted by an act of mischief, I almost wanted to rip them apart, allowing the down and its stories to expand and escape outward.Adapted from Harvest: The Hidden Histories of Seven Natural Objects by Edward Posnett, published by The Bodley Head on 8 August and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a46a67c2b617e0d4430ce9c5dd0f807c90fcff/207_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e3e063578c32e818ed9fce6fb8833f5","title":"guatemala fenix nickel mine consultation solway group","story":"Campaigners say full consultation was not carried out before 2014 reopening of European-owned Fenix siteGuatemala’s constitutional court has upheld a request from indigenous campaigners to suspend operations at one of the largest nickel mines in Central America, in a battle over the facility’s environmental impact.The court found in favour of an appeal brought by campaigners who claim the ministry of energy and mines failed to carry out a full consultation with local people when it decided, in 2016, to extend the licence for the Fenix mine.Fenix, which is owned by a company headquartered in Switzerland and with large operations in Russia and Ukraine, had lain dormant for decades before being reopened in 2014.The shock court ruling comes one month after the  joined a group of 35 media organisations in 30 countries to investigate Fenix as part of the Green Blood project, a series about the dangers faced by journalists reporting on the environment.It is understood that the court will shortly issue a written order demanding an immediate halt to further activity at the opencast mine and refinery.Fenix is near the town of El Estor, on the shores of Lake Izabal, Guatemala’s largest expanse of fresh water. The lake is an important breeding ground for wildlife including crocodiles and manatees, a freshwater mammal suffering population declines across the region. The lake’s fish are a source of food and income for local people.In the hills above Izabal, there are about 20 Mayan villages, some of which do not appear on official maps, within the 250,000 sq km area covered by the Fenix licence. Those nearest the mine have complained of water shortages and crop failures.The mine’s owner, Solway Group, says it carries out impact studies before digging, that it obeys all applicable environmental laws, and that there is no scientific evidence of harm to the local environment.Responding to the ruling, the Swiss group said: “Solway’s operational activities are always performed in accordance with the law. We will certainly follow the constitutional court’s decision. However, as an employer responsible for the lives of over 2,000 staff members and their families, we will take all possible measures not to halt our operations to the extent that this is possible within the legal framework.”An appeal against a decision by the Guatemalan ministry of energy and mines to extend the Fenix licence, in 2016, was brought by members of the fishermen’s union, who began protesting against the mine in 2017. The appeal was upheld in February this year.In a statement on Friday, the constitutional court said it had decided to uphold a further demand from campaigners to temporarily halt operations until the conclusion of the legal battle over consultation.Solway, based in the Swiss town of Zug, is appealing against the ruling that it should consult the community. A hearing on the issue is scheduled for 25 July.In the interim, the court said its intention was to “grant provisional relief in favour of the applicants temporarily suspending, pending the processing of the appeal, the licence of the mining exploitation right called Fenix”.Judges cited Guatemala’s commitment to the 1989 Central American Commission on Environment and Development, which committed the country to the “rational” use of natural resources, pollution control and restoration of ecological balance.The disputes between Solway and local communities began in May 2017 after the waters of Lake Izabal turned red for a period of weeks. Government studies blamed an algae bloom caused by sewage, and denied any link to the mine. But campaigners remained concerned and continued to take direct action, erecting blockades near the gates of the mine and barricading the families of workers inside a residential compound."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a84fe5c28acbd3a033aab23987787ed7532461/0_12_3456_2075/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa35e684100a3a7680a7227390c1bdf8","title":"israeli spraying of herbicide near gaza harming palestinian crops","story":"Israel sprays buffer zone to deprive potential ‘terror elements’ of cover, but farmers in Gaza say crops and livelihoods are damagedIsraeli aircraft spraying herbicide beside the buffer zone along the Gaza strip is directly affecting the livelihoods of Palestinians in violation of international standards, a new report claims.The study tracked the drift of the herbicides on to the Gazan side and concluded it was killing agricultural crops and causing “unpredictable and uncontrollable damage”, according to the report’s main researcher.The report also concluded the spray is reaching more than 300 metres (980ft) into Gaza.The work was undertaken by Forensic Architecture, a research agency based at Goldsmiths, University of London, which spent 16 months investigating the potential effects of the spraying.The report’s lead researcher said that in the last five years Israeli planes have sprayed herbicide more than 30 times on the Israeli side of the buffer zone with Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, designated a terror group by the European Union.The Israeli Ministry of Defense told the  the spraying is necessary for security reasons, is “conducted only over the territory of the State of Israel” and is supervised by certified professionals.Farmers living and working in these areas, however, have long claimed that their crops and livelihoods suffer as a result.Using a video taken by Gisha, a Tel Aviv-based freedom of movement NGO, Forensic Architecture reconstructed the drift of the herbicide from a plane with the help of a fluid dynamics expert.It also analysed leaf samples, interviewed farmers and used satellite imagery to map the effects of the spraying. The resulting video report will be presented on Sunday, 21 July in Ramallah.It says harmful concentrations of the spray that surpass EU standards landed in areas where farmers had recorded damage in the past.“You see that there’s a protracted and continuous loss of greenness along the border that has over time flattened it and that isn’t recovering. It’s a piece of land that through bombings and the bulldozings and twice-a-year herbicidal spraying is becoming a barren and scorched dead zone.”Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2007 when Hamas seized control of the coastal enclave and Israel and Egypt imposed a land and sea blockade.Previous reports by the Israeli website +972 and Haaretz newspaper, along with freedom of information requests from Gisha, have unearthed similar findings about damage to the land on the Gazan side.The Forensic Architecture report provides further confirmation that the herbicide spraying has caused “unpredictable and uncontrollable damage” on the Gaza side, according to their researcher.Gisha, along with Adalah, a Palestinian rights group based in Haifa, and Al Mezan , a Gaza-based human rights group, have petitioned the Israeli military for compensation for farmers in Gaza who say they have lost crops due to the spraying.Israeli authorities have rejected the petition.However, they did provide compensation to an Israeli agricultural town, Nahal Oz, near the buffer zone in 2015, after farmers sued because they lost crops after a spraying.The Israeli Ministry of Defense did not respond to a specific question regarding wind direction, but said that the spraying is certified by professionals.“It is carried out by companies specialised in the field, in accordance with the law,” the ministry said in a statement.“The materials have been approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, and are used in agricultural fields across Israel, as well as by other countries. The process is conducted and supervised by certified professionals.”This spring was the first time in five years that Israeli Defense Forces did not spray the border area and farmers in the affected areas reported better farming conditions, according to human rights groups.Gisha, along with Adalah and Al Mezan, said that if and when the next spraying occurs, they will use Forensic Architecture’s findings to petition Israel to stop the practice or to mitigate the damage, such as providing compensation or advance notice so that farmers can cover their crops."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55bfb50f088dfcae9d939f81d834ab3f271a1410/0_76_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6ba937c27335075d8678ca872ebfb21","title":"jacob zuma refuses to testify before major corruption inquiry","story":"Former South African president claims he was treated unfairly during cross-examination The former South African president Jacob Zuma has refused to testify before a major corruption inquiry, claiming he was being questioned unfairly.Zuma was scheduled to give evidence throughout the week. But when the court reconvened on Friday morning after a 48-hour adjournment at his request, the 77-year-old’s politician’s lawyer, Muzi Sikhakhane, said he would take no further part in proceedings.Sikhakhane said Zuma had been subjected to “relentless cross-examination” in a process that had become “political”.Late on Friday his legal team said a compromise had been reached and the former president had agreed to submit statements to the inquiry in response to specific questions.The inquiry is mandated to investigate allegations of “state capture” in South Africa during Zuma’s presidency, which ended last year when he was ousted amid graft allegations.It was set up after an ombudsman’s report uncovered apparent evidence of improper contact between three wealthy businessmen brothers, Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta, and senior officials in Zuma’s administration.The report, which stopped short of asserting criminal behaviour had taken place, called for an investigation into whether Zuma, some of his cabinet members and some state companies had acted improperly.In testimony on Monday, Zuma said he had been smeared and that he was the victim of a conspiracy organised by foreign intelligence agencies. On Tuesday, he appeared increasingly uncomfortable as he was questioned by Raymond Zondo, the senior judge who chairs the inquiry.There were concerns Zuma might use the hearings as a platform to attack his successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, who led the ruling African National Congress (ANC) to a convincing election victory in May but has so far been unable to fully assert his authority over the party. But such fears have so far proved unfounded.The ANC is deeply ided between factions loyal to Zuma and reformists who support Ramaphosa.Zuma appointed loyalists to hundreds of top positions in the police, tax revenue service, intelligence agencies and other public bodies.Ramaphosa, a labour activist and tycoon who served as Zuma’s vice-president, faces attacks from another state anti-graft agency over donations he received for his campaign to lead the ANC in 2017.Busisiwe Mkhwebane, an ombudsman constitutionally charged to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by state officials, told reporters on Friday that Ramaphosa had “deliberately misled” parliament about a 500,000 rand (£28,700) donation and violated the constitution.Questioned by opposition politicians, Ramaphosa first said the donation had been a consultancy fee paid to his son Andile by a company implicated in corruption of government officials. The president revised his answer in November to say that the money had in fact been a donation to his campaign fund. Mkhwebane accepted that the mistake had been made “in good faith” but said the president should “have allowed himself sufficient time to research … a well-informed response”. This amounted to deliberate deception and was thus unethical and unconstitutional, she said, a charge that Ramaphosa’s allies said was contradictory and would be challenged in court.Ramaphosa has repeatedly said he would be prepared to appear before the commission.The charge against the president will undermine his efforts to purge the ANC of Zuma’s supporters and distract attention from the Zondo inquiry.The ombudsman, known as the public protector, is appointed by the president on the recommendation of a parliamentary panel.This year, Mkhwebane’s report into a scandal involving huge government grants to a dairy farm was declared invalid by a court because of investigative shortcomings, particularly a failure to examine the role of senior ANC officials close to Zuma.Mkhwebane has also claimed that the public enterprises minister, Pravin Gordhan, a close ally of Ramaphosa, abused his powers during a stint as finance minister. Gordhan has denied the charge, which is seen as an indirect attack on the president.The mutual accusations of graft have underlined the depth of isions within the ANC and will further disillusion voters. A quarter of a century after the end of the apartheid system, South Africa remains one of the most unequal societies in the world, with soaring unemployment, a flagging economy and high levels of violent crime.On Thursday troops were deployed in poor neighbourhoods close to the western city of Cape Town after a spate of gang-related killings. Earlier this year South Africans endured rolling electricity cuts.Zuma faces a separate corruption investigation involving 16 charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to a deal to buy European military hardware to upgrade South Africa’s armed forces in 1994. He denies the charges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dc3bdc8b925e2073f9a4527cdf2931f2020698/455_294_2774_1665/master/2774.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79931418e092bda34ff70d65fa421eb0","title":"kosovo pm resigns before questioning at the hague","story":"Ramush Haradinaj agrees to appear at Serbia war crimes inquiry but not as leaderKosovo’s prime minister has resigned after being invited for questioning by a Hague-based court investigating crimes against ethnic Serbs during and after the 1998-99 war.Ramush Haradinaj said he had agreed to be interviewed at the Kosovo Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor’s Office next week and did not want to appear there as prime minister.“I considered that I cannot go to the questioning as head of the government,” he said during a news conference on Friday.Haradinaj, who took office in September 2017, said he would “respect the legal request” although he thought the summons was politically bad for Kosovo. “I will go there,” he said. “I will defend myself as a fighter of my country.”He urged Kosovo’s president to call an early parliamentary election.The Kosovo Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor’s Office is a court that was established in 2017 at the EU’s urging. It started questioning former Kosovo fighters this year.In 2011 the Council of Europe, a human rights body, had catalogued allegations of widespread war crimes committed by the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).Haradinaj was one of the top KLA commanders during the war. A UN tribunal cleared him three times of war crimes charges.At the time of the war Kosovo was a Serbian province and most KLA members were ethnic Albanians. A bloody Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists and civilians led Nato to intervene by bombing Serbia in the spring of 1999.Kosovo made a unilateral declaration of independence in 2008 and it is recognized by the US and most of the west, but not by Serbia and its allies Russia and China."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3961638.1563549060!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"first college green traffic free plaza trial to begin on sunday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLast November An Bord Pleanála refused permission for Dublin City Council’s €10 million plaza scheme due to concerns about the ‘significantly negative impacts’ it would have on bus transport, and traffic in the city.

Cars and taxis will also be banned from the junction of George’s Street to College Green.The board last November refused permission for Dublin City Council’s €10 million plaza scheme due to concerns about the “significantly negative impacts” it would have on bus transport, and traffic in the city. The plaza plan would have seen a ban on all traffic, including buses and taxis, from accessing Dame Street through College Green.The council plans to submit a fresh application to the board later this year, but has decided to close College Green to all traffic for the next three Sundays between 7am and 7pm, to test out the popularity of the plaza and iron out any logistical difficulties.Southbound buses which normally traverse College Green to head west on Dame Street will be erted down Westmoreland Street and onto the south quays. Northbound buses will be erted through the Christchurch area and down Winetavern Street to the north quays, a plan which Dublin Bus had described at “socially regressive” when the council made its last application for the plaza.Motorists heading east on Dame Street towards College Green, will be directed to take a right turn onto George’s Street, a manoeuvre which has been illegal for many years. Some buses will also use this right hand turn to reach the south of the city.The taxi ranks at Foster’s Place and at College Green will be closed, but a temporary extended taxi rank will be available on D’Olier Street. The Luas will operate normally.A temporary two-way cycle lane will be in operation on the southern side of College Green for the day. This cycle lane was part of the council’s plans for the plaza when it applied to the board in May 2017.Art classesThe council’s head of traffic management Brendan O’Brien has said the council is not planning to redesign the plaza when it make its new submission to the board, but will instead provide more information on the traffic and transport implications of the scheme, particularly in relation to buses.This Sunday artists from the gallery will hold sketching and drawing classes in College Green at noon, 1pm, 2pm and 3pm with no booking required and all material supplied. The event will also feature interactive street art, 3D pavement illusions and face-painters.On July 28th, the area will play host to a science-based event called Explore and Create including a range of science and technology attractions from the past, present and potential future with the opportunity to participate in interactive workshops.The first week of August is International Clown Week and to celebrate, the final event on August 4th will be a “city carnival”. In addition to performances from a number of inidual artists and groups, there will be an antique carousel, while face-painters, stilt-walkers, jugglers and mime artists will host workshops to give families the chance to try out some basic circus skills.Business group Dublin Chamber has welcomed the plaza trial. “We put the idea out to our members and about three quarter thought the trial was a good idea,” head of communications Graeme McQueen said. “It’s a good move and hopefully it will educate the process and educate the next stage of the plaza.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Fota Wildlife Park have told garda\u0026iacute that the animal captured in video is a wallabyIGB says Roses have been targeted in a \u0026lsquomalicious\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquounacceptable\u0026rsquo campaignHospital asks public to limit visits to \u0026lsquogenuine\u0026rsquo emergenciesDundalk woman and daughter being held in Al-Hawl displacement camp in SyriaAhmed Majeed (25) accused of engaging in violent disorder at Lost Lane off Grafton Street\u0026lsquoThey have allowed their greed, lies and deceit to desecrate our late parents good name\u0026rsquo say two siblingsCars, buses, taxis to be banned from junction of George\u0026rsquos Street to College GreenSpouses of Irish citizens based in North will not be able to leave jurisdiction for a yearAdonis describes Boris Johnson as \u0026lsquonaked opportunist who doesn\u0026rsquot believe in Brexit\u0026rsquoJohn McGowan\u0026rsquos renal failure, pneumonia allegedly not treated for eight days after admissionMan named only as Bill addresses deceased parents in small adMale victim (45) died in North Strand incident early this morningWorst offenders include processed meats, bread products, ready-made soupsLack of dedicated police unit for buses and trains criticisedListening to music has similar effects to sedative offered to deal with nerves - studyIarnr\u0026oacuted \u0026Eacuteireann closing both centre stations to allow for repairs on Pearse Street roofCustoms officers find 35kgs of cocaine and arrest man in his 40sPhotograph of \u0026lsquoAngela Merkel Thinks We\u0026rsquore at Work\u0026rsquo flag went viralHurling and uilleann piping also included in list of cultural activities unique to Ireland"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3961525.1563541150!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i love you ma and i miss you a 90 year old s message to his ma and da","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe message appeared on page 25 of Friday’s print edition of The A 90-year-old man has sent his love to his deceased parents on the Bulletin Page of The .

File photograph: Brian LawlessPAThe Government is engaging with “international actors” to help bring Dundalk woman Lisa Smith and her two-year-old daughter back to Ireland, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan has confirmed.Ms Smith (37), who travelled to Islamic State in Syria, is being held in the Al-Hawl displacement camp in Syria for the wives and children of Islamic State fighters.She moved to Syria, via Tunisia, in 2015 shortly after leaving the Air Corps where she worked as a flight attendant on the Government jet and as a driver to senior officers. She served for a time with the Army as part of the 27th Infantry Battalion.Speaking on the sidelines of an EU meeting of justice ministers in Helsinki, Finland, Mr Flanagan said the Government is unlikely to send any Irish personnel to Syria to bring Ms Smith back due to the dangers they might face.“I am most reluctant to comment on any inidual consular case. But what I will say is that there are unique circumstances attached to this particular case insofar as the terrain is concerned,” Mr Flanagan said.“It’s a real challenge for Irish officials or people acting on behalf of the Irish state to enter one of the most challenging areas of conflict in the world.”The Minister said Ireland is “engaging with international actors in order to offer assistance” but declined to give more detail.It is the first official confirmation the Government is relying on external parties to help bring Ms Smith and her child to Ireland.The Government previously rejected a plan from the Defence Forces to bring her home from Syria two months ago through co-operation with foreign intelligence agencies.The plan, which was drawn up by the Directorate of Military Intelligence, also known as J2, was presented to Minister of State for Defence Paul Kehoe in late April. It would have involved her being removed from the camp and sent south to the Jordanian border and to safety.It has also previously been reported that the Government has asked for assistance from the International Red Cross in bringing Ms Smith and her daughter from Syria to Turkey where she would be met by Irish officials.Although declining to comment on inidual cases, Mr Flanagan indicated Ms Smith will be interviewed by gardaí immediately on her arrival in Ireland and may have to undergo a deradicalisation process.“With people coming from that region to Ireland, arriving in Ireland, it’s important there are be interviews, welfare arrangements and also a process of deradicalisation if appropriate.”He insisted no new legislation is needed to specifically prevent people from travelling to Syria or Iraq to join extremist groups.This week, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and several politicians from Ms Smith’s home county of Louth said she should be allowed return with her child.In her latest media interview at the Al Hawl refugee camp near the Turkish border where she is being detained, Ms Smith said she does not think she will be allowed to return to Ireland.Mr Varadkar told RTÉ’s Today with Seán O’Rourke radio programme he wanted to see Ms Smith and her two-year-old child, an Irish citizen, return to Ireland. “I want her child to be able to come home. I would never separate a mother and child,” he said.Asked about difficulties associated with returning Ms Smith to Ireland, Mr Varadkar declined to comment on “military operations” but said the Government did not want to put any personnel at risk."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3961644.1563549730!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"merkel calls for fresh thinking to negate need for border backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerman chancellor Angela Merkel at her summer press conference in Berlin on Friday. Photograph:John MacDougallGetty ImagesChancellor Angela Merkel has called for fresh, creative thinking on the UK’s future relationship with the European Union after Brexit to “square the circle” on the Irish border and obviate the need for a backstop.Before heading off on her summer holidays, the German leader flagged the prospect of more time for London but insisted that the UK-EU withdrawal agreement is not up for negotiation.Reviving the circular logic of “Brexit means Brexit”, about to be joined in political retirement by its British originator, Dr Merkel told the Berlin press on Friday: “The withdrawal agreement is the withdrawal agreement.”But she suggested that the solution to the present EU-UK standoff over the backstop lay less in the present than in the future.Building on signals in recent months, Dr Merkel proposed calming British fears of being trapped in a post-Brexit limbo by sketching out in greater detail the possibilities of a future relationship. Her pre-holiday homework to Dublin, London and Brussels: devise new supplementary proposals on the medium-term future to prevent a no-deal Brexit in the immediate future, on October 31.“The task is to draft future relations that way and perhaps to draft them more specifically and better and more succinctly than we have managed to date,” she said.Opposition to the backstop, she pointed out, lay behind Westminster’s triple rejection of Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement deal – forcing her resignation.She refused to speculate on working with Boris Johnson, should he succeed Mrs May, nor would she be drawn on whether she favours another British referendum on EU membership.“I trust very firmly that Britain will find its way,” she said. “It is a proud, great nation and it will remain our partner even if Britain is no longer a member of the European Union.”HealthThe German leader heads off on her summer break after a particularly gruelling year and speculation about her health, following three recent trembling spells in public.Quizzed by journalists, she said she understood questions about her health – but offered no answers apart from insisting she was “able to fulfil my function”.“As a person I have a great interest in my health,” she said, adding that she hoped for “a further life” after she leaves politics – 2021 at the latest.Batting off questions with the effortless skill of a tennis professional, Dr Merkel said the character traits most essential to her since entering in the chancellery in 2005 were “optimistic realism . . . joy . . . openness to judge new situations”.Was President Donald Trump one such situation?“These characteristics withhold various situations,” she said drily.She distanced herself from Mr Trump’s suggestion that four women politicians of colour, three born in the United States, should “go back” to their homeland.With characteristic modesty, she described her last working week as “eventful”: waving her defence minister off into the European Commission presidency to replace her in Berlin with a close political confidante, Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, thereby boosting her succession chances.Despite inner-coalition conflicts, and an existential crisis in her Social Democratic Party (SPD) partner, Dr Merkel insisted her fourth term government was working well, promising important decisions on climate change in September.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

When they enter shallow waters, most of them have a tendency to become disoriented. They use echolocation for orientation, for finding one another, estimating the depth, and so on.But a sloping, sandy bottom appears to increase their disorientation. There are numerous examples of them having beached where there is such a sandy, sloping bottom.”She added that pilot whales tend to swim in close-knit groups, which increases the risk of a large number being beached at once.It comes after 145 pilot whales were found stranded on an island in New Zealand, of which half were already dead. The other half had to be put down.  The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

And it remains so unbelievable in part because it was also the end of the most significant part of the space race, with space travel soon after never ascending to such heights or levels of interest again.Here is the facts about that Apollo 11 Moon landing, including when and how humanity managed such an accomplishment – as well as why.The three astronauts in Apollo 11 set off on 16 July, 1969. After flying for three days, they entered lunar orbit, and on 20 July, Neil Armstrong stepped out of the lander and became the first person to ever walk on the Moon.After more than eight days in space, they dropped down on Earth and were hailed as heroes.Created with Sketch.

No human has ventured there – or even outside of low-Earth orbit – since.With great difficulty. Which in turn was overcome by hard work and ingenuity, as part of\u0026nbspthe culmination of thousands of years of human curiosity.Why some people still believe that we never went to the MoonThe Moon is, obviously, a long way away: about 250,000 miles. And getting there also means leaving Earth’s powerful gravity, which is just as difficult, pulling anything down and requiring vast power.That power came in the form of the Saturn V rocket, the biggest and most powerful rocket ever made, and arguably the most mighty piece of machinery that humanity has ever put together.On top sat the three astronauts, in a much smaller capsule. The rocket carried the astronauts up into space, but it was this capsule that would carry them to the Moon and back, once they had managed to escape Earth.That capsule, known as the command service module, was actually made up of three parts: the command module, that served as the astronauts’\u0026nbsphome through the mission, the service module that contained the bits that powered them through space and kept them alive, and the lunar module.It was only that latter part that ever made its way to the Moon’s surface, after detaching from the rest and touching down on the ground. After Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had explored the Moon, they climbed back into the ascent stage part of that lunar module and used it to fly back up and attach to the main craft, which was being piloted by their colleague Michael Collins.They would then gradually float back to Earth, crashing down to land and completing their mission successfully.There was never any one justification for heading to the Moon. And many people thought we should head there for no reason at all – just because we can, and therefore should.But there was another pressing reason: because other people could. The Moon landing was the crescendo of the Space Race, which had seen the US battle with the Soviet space programme to get to a range of different milestones.Apollo 11 launch video shows immense power of Saturn V rocketLast remaining moon landing video tapes up for auctionWhy some people still believe that we never went to the MoonThat didn’t start with the Moon. Both countries – embroiled at the same time in the Cold War – flung rockets, satellites, animals and people into space to demonstrate their power, and putting a man on the Moon became the inevitable conclusion of that work.All of those various aims and desires came wrapped together in a speech given by John F Kennedy in 1961, which helped launch the race for the Moon and set down the reasons for doing so.“I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth,” he said.\u0026nbsp”No single space project in this period will be more exciting, or more impressive, or more important for the long-range exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.”Getting there helped improve science in myriad ways. A variety of breakthroughs came as a result of the work done to get humanity to the Moon, and when the astronauts touched down they also helped with scientific work in unprecedented ways – they gathered up Moon rocks, left behind sensors, and even the ways that their bodies responded to the stress and strangeness of space was studied to give information that is still being studied to this day.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also wants new powers to allow him to introduce a temporary cap on rents while the commission is doing its work to establish a longer-term system.Polls suggest that around two-thirds of Londoners favour rent controls which are in place in cities such as Berlin and New York.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed.

That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The proportion of people renting from private landlords in the capital has risen from 11 per cent in 1990 to 26 per cent last year.Research published last week by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that private rents are now unaffordable for workers on the median wage in London, the southeast, southwest and east of England, effectively pricing out many key workers such as nurses and primary school teachers.The problem is particularly acute in London where rents take up 42 per cent of the average pre-tax wage. Separate research by housing charity Shelter found that rents in several London boroughs are among the least affordable anywhere in the UK.\u0026nbspKensington and Chelsea is the least affordable borough, with average rents equivalent to 127 per cent of a low-earning family’s\u0026nbsppay, followed by Westminster at 111 per cent and Camden at 92 per cent.\u0026nbspLower-income working families in two-thirds\u0026nbspof England need to spend more than 30 per cent of their income to rent a two-bed home.Housing crisis: Nurses and teachers priced out of UK regions by risingThe mayor’s plans require a new bill to be approved by parliament handing him extra powers. Any new legislation is likely to come up against stiff resistance from the government which has previously stated its opposition to rent controls.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the government had already taken “unprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants who live in rented accommodation”.Rent controls are controversial with some studies showing that in certain\u0026nbspforms they can benefit particular\u0026nbspgroups over others.A 2017 paper by researchers at Stanford University found that rent controls introduced in San Francisco led to some landlords converting\u0026nbsptheir properties into expensive apartments because these were classed as new builds which were exempt from the rules.The study found that the amount saved by people in rent-controlled properties was roughly cancelled out by more expensive rents for tenants in non-rent-controlled homes.Mr Khan’s report proposes additional measures, some of which the government has already said it wants to introduce, including introducing open-ended tenancies, and ending no-fault evictions. The mayor also says he wants to scrap break clauses and\u0026nbspimprove dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And you’d have this incredible shot of green plants against a red background,” he said.SpaceX could land on the moon by 2021, Elon Musk claims (SpaceX)“My goal was simply to get the public excited, which would then get Congress excited so that they would appropriate more money and increase Nasa’s budget.”With the increasing success of SpaceX, Mr Musk has since extended his ambitions for the firm.

How many years between sequel and original? SevenIt wasn\u0027t until the arrival of Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me that Mike Myers\u0027s comic creations were fully wedged into the hearts of film lovers. If the original was the perfect introduction to Austin\u0027s groovy world, the follow-up was an altogether funnier, bigger and more quotable affair. How many years between sequel and original? TwoCapping off not only your own franchise but a decade-long series consisting of 22 films is no mean feat – and yet Avengers: Endgame balanced all the playing pieces to do so with gargantuan success. How many years between sequel and original? Seven437 Back to the Future Part II (1989)The first sequel to Robert Zemeckis\u0027s Back to the Future is an amusing adventure that sees Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travel... well, back to the future, to prevent his own son from sabotaging the family legacy. How many years between sequel and original? FourIt was the addition of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito – as Catwoman and the Penguin, respectively – that made Tim Burton\u0027s sequel Batman Returns an even more memorable watch than the original. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeEach instalment of Richard Linklater\u0027s Before trilogy is as good as the last. But, if there is a peak, it surely arrives with number two – Before Sunset – which reunites would-be lovers Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) nine years after they first met in Before Sunrise (1995). How many years between sequel and original? NineThere\u0027s a blistering chase sequence midway through The Bourne Ultimatum involving Matt Damon\u0027s amnesiac spy and journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine). It\u0027s adeptly directed by Paul Greengrass – here at the top of his game – and is all the proof you need that the original trilogy improved with each new film. How many years between sequel and original? Five837 Bride of Frankenstein (1935)Depicting Mary Shelley\u0027s classic creature as a pleasant guy just looking for a companion, Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest monster movies, let alone sequels, in cinema history. How many years between sequel and original? FourBatman Begins may have been the perfect origin story for the caped crusader, but nothing could have prepared film fans for the classic its sequel would become. Christopher Nolan intelligently crafted The Dark Knight into one of the greatest follow-ups ever made, with several standout action sequences and an untouchable performance from Heath Ledger as the Joker. One for the ages. How many years between sequel and original? Three1037 Dawn of the Dead (1978)George A Romero ditched the entire cast of Night of the Living Dead for its first sequel, Dawn of the Dead, which showed the effects of the zombie apocalypse on a much larger scale than depicted in the black-and-white original. One of the most entertaining horror films ever made.  How many years between sequel and original? 10The glory you feel watching Hellboy II: The Golden Army comes from the knowledge that you\u0027re watching a studio allow Guillermo del Toro to do whatever the hell he wants. A scintillating oddity of a follow-up that surpasses the 2004 original within minutes. How many years between sequel and original? FourNot so much an improvement on the first as one that rips up its rule book completely: Sam Raimi took the character of Ash (Bruce Campbell), who viewers first met in influential 1981 horror The Evil Dead,\u0026nbspand placed him in the heart of what is essentially a slapstick comedy. How many years between sequel and original? SixAfter the lacklustre fourth instalment, Fast \u0026amp Furious 5 was the reinvention the series desperately needed. Bringing in Dwayne Johnson as the bad guy was a genius stroke and the final set-piece – a car dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio – remains as entertaining as anything the long-running series has ever done. How many years between sequel and original? 10The Godfather Part II set the highest benchmark for what sequels should be, but so rarely are – a crucial chapter in a saga. The film won Robert De Niro an Oscar for his efforts, playing the same role Marlon Brando won an Oscar for two years before. This, alongside another film on this list, is one of two sequels to ever win Best Picture (keep scrolling to find out the other one). How many years between sequel and original? Two1537 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)The fact that Sergio Leone had barely any money to make The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – the third film in his Man With no Name trilogy – fortuitously led to the casting of the relatively unknown Clint Eastwood. Leone\u0027s film, beautifully soundtracked by Ennio Morricone, is a masterwork that proves less is more: its most classic dialogue-free scenes derived from the fact that Leone had no time to shoot dialogue. How many years between sequel and original? Two1637 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)Gone was the warm glow of Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s adaptation of the JK Rowling novel proved the franchise could win widespread acclaim, as well as ticket receipts, if put in the hands of interesting directors. How many years between sequel and original? Three1737 How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)Could How to Train Your Dragon endure as one of the most beloved yet underrated franchises of all time? Quite possibly – and its first sequel, which features breathless flight sequences and animation to marvel at, is solid evidence of this. How many years between sequel and original? FourDespite essentially rehashing the plot of the first film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a bolder, more exciting and, yes, deadlier outing for Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s heroine Katniss Everdeen. How many years between sequel and original? One1937 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)If Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade isn\u0027t better than series opener Raiders of the Lost Ark, it\u0027s certainly as good. This is thanks to the addition of Sean Connery\u0027s Henry Jones Sr – the father of Harrison Ford\u0027s whip-cracking archaeologist. How many years between sequel and original? EightPerhaps it was down to relief that Iron Man 3 was so revered by critics (lest we forget Iron Man 2 is one of Marvel\u0027s biggest duds). But, Robert Downey Jr\u0027s third solo outing as Tony Starl boasts enough laughs and thrills, not to mention a doozy of a twist, that earns its placement on this list. How many years between sequel and original? FiveLethal Weapon 2 takes what made the original so fun – the wit and twist-filled action – and amps it up as far as it can possibly go. That it throws in Joe Pesci for good measure just makes the results even more sizzling. How many years between sequel and original? TwoLogan rectified the mistakes of Wolverine\u0027s earlier standalone films thanks to James Mangold\u0027s decision to place the character in a far grittier film than he was used to (it was rated 15 in the UK). The result remains a perfect send-off to one of X-Men\u0027s greatest characters, who first played the role in 2000.How many years between sequel and original? 17Gareth Evans\u0027s sequel to The Raid is more of the glorious same, only – somehow – more ambitious. Two hours and 30 minutes of breathlessly-paced fight sequences that\u0027s unlike anything caught on film before. How many years between sequel and original? Three2437 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)The second sequel to ever win Best Picture is all about the payoff. While each film in Peter Jackson\u0027s Lord of the Rings trilogy delivers in what it needs to, this final chapter balances all the plates to dish out an epic conclusion that surely would have been everything JRR Tolkien wanted from an adaptation of his classic novels. How many years between sequel and original? TwoNobody could have predicted quite how breathlessly entertaining Mad Max: Fury Road would be. George Miller\u0027s dystopian chase film refuses to relent from the very first second and is just as entertaining with every watch – and far superior to the Mel Gibson original, which was released in 1979. How many years between sequel and original? 36There has never been a bad Mission: Impossible film. However, since Christopher McQuarrie stepped into the fold as director, the series has taken just as many audacious leaps as its lead star, the stunt-loving Tom Cruise. Fallout is a multi-layered, twisty action film that will undoubtedly go down as a franchise classic. How many years between sequel and original? 22All it took was the spirit of Christmas for the Griswolds to get the film they deserved. Chevy Chase heads up this one liner-filled festive treat that\u0027s probably the only Vacation film worth your time. How many years between sequel and original? FourOne critic described Paddington 2 as the Godfather Part II of Peruvian Bear movies and they were not wrong. The sequel somehow manages to convey more charm than the original – which in itself is extremely charming – and has the benefit of starring Hugh Grant as a villainous actor named Phoenix Buchanan. A delight. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeAll eyes were on Shrek 2 thanks to the unprecedented success of the fantastic original, which was released in 2001. What people didn\u0027t expect, though, was that the follow-up would be just as hilarious and even more enchanting. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeSam Raimi managed to outdo himself with Spider-Man 2 (the first one remains a superhero standout) with help from Alfred Molina\u0027s Doctor Octopus and some nightmarish scenes in which the Evil Dead filmmaker delves into his bursting bag of horror movie tricks. How many years between sequel and original? Two3137 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)By placing the emphasis on character as opposed to action, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan righted the wrongs of the classic TV show\u0027s first big screen adventure, a dud that was released in 1979. The result is a staggeringly improved follow-up. How many years between sequel and original? thREEThe Empire Strikes Back would make this list for its twist alone, which ranks as one of the greatest in cinema history, but the film also represents so much more. Episode V established the Star Wars franchise\u0027s staying power by proving A New Hope was no fluke. How many years between sequel and original? Three3337 War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)With War for the Planet of the Apes, Fox\u0027s closing chapter of the rebooted trilogy, Matt Reeves delivered a near-faultless arthouse film parading as a mo-cap monkey-filled blockbuster. How many years between sequel and original?  SixIt would have been easy to chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane\u0027s acclaim to the fact it was a secret up until a month before it was released. The fact remains, though, that this spiritual successor to 2008 found-footage thriller Cloverfield is a gruellingly tense chamber piece that\u0027s even more nail-biting than the first. How many years between sequel and original? EightThose who believed you couldn\u0027t get a more groundbreaking film than The Terminator likely burst a vessel after watching Judgement Day, a sequel that reshaped what people wanted from their action movies forevermore. It did so while subverting expectation in the most simplest of ways – by turning Arnie\u0027s killing machine, the terrifying villain in the first, into a cuddly force for good. How many years between sequel and original? SevenWhen Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok. The finished product is Asgards apart from the first of the hero\u0027s two adventures, starring Chris Hemsworth, that were released in 2011 and 2013. How many years between sequel and original? SixSure, the third and fourth instalments might have the emotional payoffs, but –\u0026nbspthanks to a series of standout scenes (the traffic cone pileup, anyone?) – it\u0027s Toy Story 2 that stands tall as the best of Pixar\u0027s sequels. How many years between sequel and original? FourRidley Scott\u0027s Alien may be an acclaimed horror film, but sequel Aliens – directed by James Cameron – is a stone cold action classic.

After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.1062 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1162 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth.1262 Tommy convinces himself he made an omeletteEncouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.) Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1362 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1562 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1662 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1962 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2162 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2262 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2362 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa. Tommy put his boxing training into practice as he dodged her kisses, while a jealous Mollie Mae watched on from behind a potted plant.2562 Jordan and Tom enter the villaAfter being the only two girls not picked for recoupling, Anna and Maura got to go on a date with the new boys: 29-year-old Tom and 24-year-old Jordan.2662 Joe and Elma leave the villaThe islanders voted for the couple they thought was least compatible, leaving the Joe-Lucie and Anton-Elma couples vulnerable.

Amy was not happy, storming off followed by an apologetic Curtis.Arabella stirred the pot when she accused Yewande of being overly-possessive of Danny, telling her a few uncomplimentary remarks Danny had made about her to boot. A devastated Yewande soon realised that her fledgling romance was in serious jeopardy.3262 Maura is livid at TomMaura’s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3362 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton. She was devastated to leave best mates Amber and Anna, but Danny was left with a scathing parting shot: “What goes around comes around.” Ouch.3462 Danny faces the wrath of AmberAmber was furious after watching Danny kiss Arabella the same night that Yewande left the villa. She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation.3562 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate momentAfter declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season’s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the £50k?During a challenge which saw the islanders read the public’s tweets, some couples were left seriously shaken. Amy was called out for making Curtis feel “in the wrong,” Lucie and Tommy were named as a good potential couple and Mollie Mae was accused of faking her relationship with Tommy for the prize money.3762 Mollie Mae worries about LucieThe Twitter challenge made Mollie Mae re-examine Tommy’s close friendship with Lucie. After a chat with Mollie Mae, the boxer told Lucie they should stop being so affectionate with each other. A disgruntled Lucie complained about the new “rules” imposed on her, while also refusing to rule out a potential relationship with Tommy during a chat with the girls.Maura wasn’t happy to hear that Tom had called her “attention-seeking” and “cringey” behind her back. She stormed over and confronted him, later making it clear he had blown his second chance.3962 Arabella and Tom get dumped from the islandAfter four couples were left vulnerable following a public vote, the three safe couples decided that Arabella and Tom should be the pair to leave the villa. Maura comforted a devastated Danny, but didn’t appear to be that heartbroken about losing Tom.4062 Lucie confesses her feelings for Tommy Encouraged by Anton, Lucie revealed to Tommy that she would be interested in rekindling their romance. Tommy told her he was happy with Mollie Mae, and later told Mollie about Lucie’s confession, leading Mollie to brand the Cornish surfer “muggy” for not coming to her first.4162 The girls take a holiday to Casa AmorSix new boys entered the game when the girls took a trip to Casa Amor. A thrilled Maura took an instant liking to Dennon, while 6ft 7in basketball player Ovie immediately cracked on with Anna, leaving her relationship with Jordan in jeopardy. 4262 Six new girls cause the boys to have doubtsBack at the villa, heads were also turning at the arrival of six new girls. Jordan flirted with Jourdan, Anton shared a bed with Belle and Danny seemed ready to move on from his Arabella heartbreak. Michael and Curtis began to question their own seemingly-solid partnerships, thanks to pretty newcomer Joanna. Anton remained hopeful about his odds of finally finding love: “I’ve got six new chances to not get pied.”4362 Curtis tells Jourdan he wants to recouple with herCurtis took a risk and laid it all out to Jourdan, telling her he would choose to recouple with her over Amy.

Michael recoupled with Joanna, leaving Amber single – and absolutely fuming. Poor Jordan saw Anna return with basketball player Ovie, although she was more apologetic about it than Michael. Mollie Mae collapsed into relieved tears when she saw Tommy waiting for her, holding her favourite stuffed elephant toy Ellie-Belly. Anton finally found himself in a romantic couple with Belle, Lucie coupled with new blonde bombshell George and Maura seemed keen on sensitive Marvin.4862 Michael and Curtis catch some serious heatAfter seeing Amber in tears, Anna went straight for Michael’s jugular, accusing him of leading Amber on by not communicating his doubts about their relationship earlier. Michael went on the defensive, calling Anna and Amber “childish.” Meanwhile a tearful Amy gave Curtis a dressing down for making moves on Jourdan: “Do you know how worthless this makes me feel?”4962 Maura serves some cold, hard truthWhile Amy was discussing her drama with Curtis to Maura and Lucie, she seemed on the verge of forgiveness: “I love him,” she said. A doubtful Lucie interjected: “But does he love you?” A furious Maura took a less subtle approach: “Why are you asking her that? He doesn’t!” 5062 Lucie tells Tommy she has feelings for him – againAfter Tommy took Lucie aside to check they were still friends, she confessed she’s still attracted to him, wishes she had chosen him over Joe and was thinking about him the whole time she was in Casa Amor. Once again, Tommy brushed her off saying he was still smitten with Mollie Mae – perhaps third time lucky, Lucie?5162 Tommy and Mollie Mae get seriousAfter the latest declaration from Lucie, Tommy reassured Mollie Mae by telling her how much he liked her. Mollie Mae confessed she could see herself falling in love with him, before Tommy admitted he was already falling.5262 Anna and Jordan rekindle their romanceWhen Anna returned to the villa and saw Jordan was still single, she seemed to question her new romance with Ovie.

George and Marvin were sat down and pied together, with Marvin reacting with outrage and George barely keeping a straight face. Ovie may have seemed like her perfect man in Casa Amor, but Jordan caught Anna’s eye once again when she returned to the villa. Anna sat down for a chat with the laid-back basketball player, but things got heated quickly. Ovie stormed off before Anna headed up for a sneaky balcony snog with Jordan. 5762 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposalTommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn’t Tommy’s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.Not long after Danny coupled up with Yewande and Arabella the two girls were sent packing, leading presenter Iain Sterling to nickname Danny ‘the travel agent’ for his talent in sending girls to the airport. New partner Jourdan was the final girl to fall under Danny’s curse as the pair received the least votes, although this time Danny was booted from the villa too.5962 Amy leaves on heartbreaking noteAs she prepared to leave the villa, Amy took her ex Curtis aside for a chat. Days after Curtis had ended their relationship, she told him: You turned my whole world around and turned it into some kind of craziness. All I\u0027ve ever wanted is for you to be happy. And you\u0027re not going to be able to be happy if I\u0027m still here. As Curtis broke down in tears, she continued: I want us to be best friends and I want us to both find someone... I\u0027m not going to be ready in the next three weeks to meet someone else.He might be coupled up with Joanna, but it was Michael’s ex Amber who got his pulse racing fastest during the dirty dancing challenge.

Ovie may have seemed like her perfect man in Casa Amor, but Jordan caught Anna’s eye once again when she returned to the villa. Anna sat down for a chat with the laid-back basketball player, but things got heated quickly. Ovie stormed off before Anna headed up for a sneaky balcony snog with Jordan. 5762 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposalTommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn’t Tommy’s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.Not long after Danny coupled up with Yewande and Arabella the two girls were sent packing, leading presenter Iain Sterling to nickname Danny ‘the travel agent’ for his talent in sending girls to the airport. New partner Jourdan was the final girl to fall under Danny’s curse as the pair received the least votes, although this time Danny was booted from the villa too.5962 Amy leaves on heartbreaking noteAs she prepared to leave the villa, Amy took her ex Curtis aside for a chat. Days after Curtis had ended their relationship, she told him: You turned my whole world around and turned it into some kind of craziness. All I\u0027ve ever wanted is for you to be happy. And you\u0027re not going to be able to be happy if I\u0027m still here. As Curtis broke down in tears, she continued: I want us to be best friends and I want us to both find someone... I\u0027m not going to be ready in the next three weeks to meet someone else.He might be coupled up with Joanna, but it was Michael’s ex Amber who got his pulse racing fastest during the dirty dancing challenge. Amber was glad to hear it, saying: “So now I\u0027ve at least got something, I can\u0027t just sit and mope around because I know I raised his heart rate the most!6162 Anton and Belle hit the rocksShe may have shaved his bum, but Belle reached breaking point after a series of slip-ups from Anton. She wasn’t happy that he kissed Anna in the Snog, Marry, Pie challenge, and a confrontation ended in a heated exchange at the nightclub6262 Joanna and Michael say an awkward goodbyeAfter it was revealed that Joanna and Michael couldn’t stay in the villa together, their fellow Islanders chose to send Joanna packing. She was less than impressed with Michael after it became clear he wouldn’t follow her out of the door, refusing a hug and labelling him a “snake” for staying.

He also wants new powers to allow him to introduce a temporary cap on rents while the commission is doing its work to establish a longer-term system.Polls suggest that around two-thirds of Londoners favour rent controls which are in place in cities such as Berlin and New York.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed. Londoners need fundamental change that is long overdue,”\u0026nbspMr Khan said.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK Housing Crisis: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of ‘generation rent’, as the younger generation is often known, are finding it far more difficult to get on the housing market than previous generationsThen chancellor George Osborne visits a Help to Buy housing development in Lewisham in 2014.

That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The proportion of people renting from private landlords in the capital has risen from 11 per cent in 1990 to 26 per cent last year.Research published last week by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that private rents are now unaffordable for workers on the median wage in London, the southeast, southwest and east of England, effectively pricing out many key workers such as nurses and primary school teachers.The problem is particularly acute in London where rents take up 42 per cent of the average pre-tax wage. Separate research by housing charity Shelter found that rents in several London boroughs are among the least affordable anywhere in the UK.\u0026nbspKensington and Chelsea is the least affordable borough, with average rents equivalent to 127 per cent of a low-earning family’s\u0026nbsppay, followed by Westminster at 111 per cent and Camden at 92 per cent.\u0026nbspLower-income working families in two-thirds\u0026nbspof England need to spend more than 30 per cent of their income to rent a two-bed home.Housing crisis: Nurses and teachers priced out of UK regions by risingThe mayor’s plans require a new bill to be approved by parliament handing him extra powers. Any new legislation is likely to come up against stiff resistance from the government which has previously stated its opposition to rent controls.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the government had already taken “unprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants who live in rented accommodation”.Rent controls are controversial with some studies showing that in certain\u0026nbspforms they can benefit particular\u0026nbspgroups over others.A 2017 paper by researchers at Stanford University found that rent controls introduced in San Francisco led to some landlords converting\u0026nbsptheir properties into expensive apartments because these were classed as new builds which were exempt from the rules.The study found that the amount saved by people in rent-controlled properties was roughly cancelled out by more expensive rents for tenants in non-rent-controlled homes.Mr Khan’s report proposes additional measures, some of which the government has already said it wants to introduce, including introducing open-ended tenancies, and ending no-fault evictions. The mayor also says he wants to scrap break clauses and\u0026nbspimprove dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Aside from Glastonbury, few other events spark so much excitement around the unveiling of their lineup. And while there are fewer “rock and roll” names on the billing this year, Primavera is leading the charge when it comes to proper representation of artists from different backgrounds, ethnicities and genders – without sacrificing anything in terms of quality. More than 50 per cent of the lineup is comprised of female-fronted acts, including Cardi B, FKA twigs, Christine and the Queens, Charli XCX, Robyn, Janelle Monae, Carly Rae Jepsen, Kate Tempest, Sigrid, Courtney Barnett, Yaeji, Peggy Gou and Helena Hauff. You’ve also got Interpol, Future, Nas, Mura Masa, Suede, Tame Impala, Kurt Vile and Mac deMarco. So it’s not as though guests will be short on options.Belgium’s biggest music festival often scores the most impressive lineup of any in Europe, and this year is no different. But don’t let the name mislead you: Rock Werchter’s lineup is always eclectic, and this year’s will include headline performances from Florence + the Machine, Muse and The Cure, plus Mumford and Sons, The 1975, Bring Me the Horizon, Kylie Minogue, Weezer, Brockhampton, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Mac DeMarco. The festival site is situated on a farm near the town of Leuven, which is just a half-hour train from Brussels so festival-goers can choose to stay in the city if they don’t feel like camping. Organisers take special care to ensure good accessibility for all, so there is a separate entrance for less physically abled guests, and plastic surfacing over the grounds for easier wheelchair use.Roskilde is the biggest festival in northern Europe, so you expect big names – and each year organisers deliver. This year it’s going big on “the power of pop” and its ability to bring people together, so you have avant-garde artists like Christine and the Queens plus goth-rock legends The Cure. Also on the billing are Jungle, Tears for Fears, Alma, Julia Holter, Parquet Courts, Travis Scott, Brockhampton and Flohio. You’ll be joined by more than 130,000 fellow music lovers, and situated right next to the Danish capital of Copenhagen with easy connections by train, bus and air.This has to be the best lineup of any festival this summer, plus it’s cheaper than Glastonbury and the weather will surely be better too. Artists performing include The Cure, Lauryn Hill, Vampire Weekend, The 1975, The National, Bon Iver, Robyn, Years \u0026amp Years, Mogwai, Sharon Van Etten, Iggy Pop, Gossip, Iggy Pop, Bonobo and Jorja Smith. The festival’s ferris wheel is the stuff of legend, providing guests with beautiful views of the festival site and beyond. Things don’t really kick off until around 6pm either, so there’s plenty of time to take in the surrounding art galleries, flea markets, parks and more fantastic restaurants, bars and shops than you could ever hope to visit in the space of one trip. Plus there’s a great indie disco that goes on until the early hours.There are so many reasons to try this festival in Portugal’s coastal capital. Let’s start with the music: each year Nos Alive manages to assemble a most erse yet cohesive lineup of artists, from pop and rock to electronic and heavy metal. This year its headliners are The Cure, Vampire Weekend, Gossip, The Smashing Pumpkins and Bon Iver. If that’s not impressive enough, you can also catch Jorja Smith, Hot Chip, H.E.R, Thom Yorke, Idles and Loyle Carner. The festival is set on the docks near two of Lisbon’s most breathtaking landmarks: the Jeronimos Monastery and the Belem tower. Due to the Portuguese culture of starting an evening out relatively late, there’s plenty of time to explore the city in the day, from the markets to the hundreds of fantastic restaurants, bars and shops.Slovakia’s biggest music festival also happens to be one of the most affordable in Europe. Its organisers understand modern music fans have eclectic taste and so they’ve invited everyone from Liam Gallagher, The 1975, Dream Wife, The Roots and Lykke Li to perform at the atmospheric Trenčín Airport.Melt’s creative director once described it as the “Berghain of German festivals”. Don’t let that scare you – by that he is more likely referring to the event’s vast scale and leaning towards electronic music, rather than the hedonism that takes place inside the notorious Berlin club. That said, the 20,000-capacity event still embraces themes of (cut) wild abandon, with house and techno acts playing non-stop (I’ve moved this) on the Sleepless Floor venue just outside the main grounds. Main stage attractions include Bon Iver, A$AP Rocky, Jorja Smith, Skepta, Four Tet, Bonobo and Yung Lean.This gem of a festival is ideally placed in one of Oslo’s biggest parks. It hosts a perfect mix of major British and US acts plus a wealth of Scandi artists placed right alongside them, to ensure homegrown talent isn’t overlooked. It’s one of the friendliest festivals in Europe: organisers are always around if you need help or questions answered, and there’s a collective good mood that continues regardless of the weather. Oya is also one of the greenest music events, and has relied on sustainable energy alone since 2009. Fifty per cent of the festival menu is meat-free, and organisers limit waste by using edible plates. You’ll likely spot Norwegian children picking up plastic cups dropped by guests – they earn a krone for each one they collect. This year’s lineup melds some of the best in hip hop, pop and rock, including The Cure, Robyn, Tame Impala, Sigrid, Erykah Badu, James Blake, Earl Sweatshirt, Karpe, and Christine and the Queens.There’s plenty to discover at this Hungarian festival, with its beach, themed parties and a week of music ning pop, indie, rock, folk, dance and reggae. This year organisers have managed to secure some of the biggest names in pop, including Ed Sheeran, Florence + the Machine, Post Malone, Twenty One Pilots and The 1975, plus Foo Fighters and dance music wunderkind Martin Garrix. Sziget is also passionate about looking after the environment, so guests can expect reusable cups, no straws unless requested,  recycling programmes, and an ecocamping programme.Location is the main draw for this hidden gem of a festival, which is set in the beautiful Sicilian town of Castelbuono – about an hour’s drive from the capital, Palermo. The main stage is placed at the foot of the castle – built during the Hohenstaufen rule in the Middle Ages – from which the town takes its name. There are few festival experiences like it: the stone bricks, which stay warm from the sun long after it has set, create gorgeous acoustics for whoever is performing. As is Italian tradition, things don’t really get going until the evening, so until then visitors can head to the beach or try some of the best food in Sicily, from pizza to granita, gelato and the famous Fiasconaro panettone. After that you can catch performances from the likes of The National, Spiritualized, Let’s Eat Grandma, Fontaines DC and Whitney, with more still to be announced. Most guests leave happy, tanned, and maybe a few pounds heavier than when they arrived.  Flow festival brings world-famous international acts to a Finnish demographic that is fiercely loyal to homegrown talent. Performing in Helsinki this year are Cardi B, Neneh Cherry, Tame Impala, Blood Orange, Yves Tumor, Earl Sweatshirt, Erykah Badu, Ibe Special, Makaya McCraven, Nitzer Ebb and many more. An infamous afterparty takes place on the skirts of a building site outside the festival walls, where DJs blast drum \u0026amp bass music and guests can take a dip in the sauna. Braver (drunker) souls occasionally make a bare-bottomed dash into the sea.  It’s been hailed as France’s answer to Glastonbury festival, and for good reason.

The other three countries have brought in varying degrees of restrictions on Huawei.Theresa May is reported to have pressed through the inclusion of Huawei in the UK telecoms infrastructure at a meeting of the National Security Council two months ago. Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, was subsequently sacked for allegedly leaking the decision to the media.However no formal announcement has been made on the decision.Created with Sketch.Inside Huawei\u0027s new campus for workers in China Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanAn employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanCommittee chairman Dominic Grieve said: “The debate over whether or not Huawei should be allowed to supply equipment to the UK 5G network has dragged on long enough and is damaging the UK’s international relationships. The new prime minister must take a decision as a matter of priority.”The Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) stated: “The UK is keen for a strong economic relationship with China. But this is not a ‘pro’ or ‘anti’ China debate. China will continue to be a key partner for the UK: one we respect greatly”.But, it continued: “The UK must not do anything that jeopardises the Five Eyes intelligence sharing relationship – the value of the partnership cannot be overstated.Trump reveals US companies will be allowed to sell to HuaweiNokia backs away from executive’s scathing attack on Huawei“Looking to the future, we must take action to reduce our over-reliance on a Chinese technology. We need to consider how we can create greater ersity in the market. This will require us to take a long-term view – but we need to start now.“In terms of the immediate issue, restricting those companies who may be involved in our 5G network will have consequences,\u0026nbspboth in terms of time and cost. And the government must weigh these, together with the security advice that any risk posed could be managed in a secure system, against the geostrategic issues outlined.“It is important to take the right decision, and take it we must: this debate has been unnecessarily protracted ... The new prime minister will no doubt have many issues to deal with in his first days in office. Nevertheless, this committee urges him to take a decision on which companies will be involved in our 5G network, so that all concerned can move forward.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But what, and where is Area  Deep in the Nevada desert is the highly secretive base known as Area , part of a detachment of the Edwards Air Force Base within the Nevada Test and Training Range.Located  miles north of Las Vegas in Nevada, it is classied as a US military installation.The patch of fenced off land, measuring six by ten miles, is tucked between a US Air Force base and an abandoned nuclear testing ground.How Stuff Works says that its location can be found via these coordinates:  degrees  minutes north latitude,  degrees  minutes west longitude.You can get a great view of it using Google Earth. Just type Area  into the fly to field and the map does the rest.After decades of government officials refusing to acknowledge Area , the CIA released declassied documents in  referring to the ,-sq minstallation by name and locating it on a map near the dry Groom Lake bed.It is a popular tourist destination.The base has been a testing ground for a host of top-secret aircraft, including the U- in the s and later the B- stealth bomber.For years the US government denied it even existed. But in  the CIA officially acknowledged its existence and its location was revealed.Declassied documents say it was originally an area for the Army Air Corp pilots to practise their aerial gunnery.During the Cold War, experimental aircraft, such as the high altitude U- spy plane, and weapons systems were tested there.Its current use is unknown and remains a top secret.More than one million people have responded to a satirical Facebook page saying they intend to storm Area  on September , .Organisers of the prank event - with their tongues firmly in their cheeks - created the page Storm Area , They Cant Stop All of Us, calling for people to storm the location between am and am on the day.The page adds: We can move faster then their bullets.Organisers of the storming joke they are planning to start a “Naruto run,” as they approach the site, a term which refers to a Japanese anime style of running with the arms thrust backward and the head stretched forward.The page, in deadpan style, says: Lets see them aliens.Although the identity of the person who made the original post has not been revealed, they wrote on the pinned post: Hello US government, this is a joke, and I do not actually intend to go ahead with this plan.I just thought it would be funny and get me some thumbsy uppies on the internet.Im not responsiblepeople decide to actually storm area .The US Air Force though has issued a strong warning to anyone actually thinking of trying to storm the site.Nellis Air Force Base said in a statement that the Air Force is aware of the Facebook posting and says any attempt to illegally access the area is highly discouraged.Air Force spokesperson Laura McAndrews has also released a warning to potential trespassers.She said: “[Area ] is an open training range for the US Air Force, and we would discourage anyone from trying to come into the area where we train American armed forces.“The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets.”It is officially known as Homey Airport, but gained its now famous name from CIA documents that referred to it by the codename Area .The exact purpose of the air base is not known publicly, and the area is heavily restricted.Trespassers can face huge fines and y prison sentences for setting foot in the zone.Purchased by the US government in , evidence suggests the site is used as a testing area for experimental aircraft and weapons.But the secrecy surrounding it has led conspiracy theorists to suggest the area is holding extra-terrestrial secrets.Theories suggest engineers examine crashed spacecrafts — and even hold meetings with aliens from across the galaxy.The crash of a weather balloon at Roswell, New Mexico in  sparked wild theories of an alien ship crash.Some have suggested Area  is still storing parts of the crashed ship — or even its alien inhabitants.The mysterious site is part of the vast Nevada Test and Training Range and has become the centre of UFO conspiracy theories.The so-called Roswell incident is one of the most discussed and controversial UFO theories in history.In July  the military sensationally announced in a press release it had found the remains of a crashed flying saucer in the desert.But the following day it retracted the statement, saying it was in fact a damaged US Air Force air balloon.Yet as reported, Sherf Jess Slaughter and Deputy Sherf Charles Fogus were on duty in a patrol car on the night of the alleged incident.Suddenly they heard reports of a crashed aircraft on their police radio.In the interview Mr Fogus claims he saw a flying saucer smash into the side of a river bed and that the flying object was “ft across”.Describing the scene, he said: “When we got there, the land was covered with soldiers. They were hauling a big, creature.“The bodies must have been  feet tall.“I saw the legs and feet on some of them. They looked like our feet.”As well as assessing alien technology it is often suggested that it is a place where meetings or joint undertakings with extraterrestrials occur.Other theories suggest it has served as a research site for a range of exotic weapons and technologies.This includes the development of time travel or teleportation technologyAnother theory is that the much rumoured Aurora stealth plane is being tested here.The most outlandish idea is that Area  is a base for a one world government.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His English was fairly limited and my Spanish went no further than: “Paella, mucho gracias.”So when, after several minutes of discussing the musical inspiration for his new single album , I went in for the killer question.“How many women have you slept with ”He shrugged.“ ” I ventured.He pulled an expression to suggest I had woefully misjudged his pulling power with the opposite sex. So I aimed higher.“, ”“Ooo knows ” he drawled with a lazy smile. “A gentleman  . . .  he never tell.”“Shall we go with , then ” I suggested, aswe were making a joint entry to one of those “guess how many sweets” attractions at the local fete. He shrugged again, a gesture I took as implicit confirmation. Well, he didn’t deny it.The interview appeared the following day and shortly afterwards the figure went global when the US-based National Enquirer ran with it.Julio, who is charm personied, made no complaint when his legendary Lothario-ism went stratospheric, though many years later he mitigated to another interviewer who broached the subject: “Me, I don’t have numbers. I respect women very much.”Like Mick Jagger, who is said to have bedded around , women, the Spanish crooner joined the ranks of Warren Beatty, Errol Flynn, Jack Nicholson and the notorious lover Casanova as one of history’s great seducers.Back then, such, ahem, swordsmanship was admired. The majority of women swooned at the mere thought of a sacred moment in their seductive gaze, while young men felt both inspired and intimidated by such a dizzyingly high number of sexual conquests.But now  Thanks to the #metoo and #timesup campaigns, men with more notches on their bedposts than the rest of us have had hot dinners are regarded with certain distaste. Last week, Julio’s tongue-in-cheek statistic popped up again, when a -year-old man finally won recognition as the star’s son — the product of a brief affair in the s.Suddenly, the legendary “,” was being viewed through the modern-day, more puritanical prism, where such behaviour might be regarded as “sex addiction”.Whatever the truth , he’s now been with we Miranda Rijnsburger for more than  years and they have five children.So it’s fair to say that his womanising days are long gone. Just as well, perhaps. Because,the Love Island men are anything to go by, old roues are now old hat and it’s romantic and wholly faithful young men like Tommy Fury who, quite rightly, earn the nation’s admiration. Long may it go on.Though it seems there are still some lotharios refusing to go quietly. Last year, Italian playboy Maurizio Zanfanti,  — dubbed the “Romeo of Rimini” after claiming to have slept with , women — died while having sex with a -year-old tourist in his car. It’s what he would have wanted.JOBLESS Daniel Eyers and his pregnant partner Lucrezia Worrell say they have been evicted from their Kent council house for spending their rent money on takeaways.The couple, who have four children, are now living with Daniel’s mum. Daniel, , says: “I can’t get a job as it would mean my children would miss out on school, as I have to drive them there every day.”Oh let me count the ways.A flexible, part-time job perhaps  How about your partner taking them to school, or asking other parents for a lt  Or perhaps desisting from having a fth childyou can’t afford to keep the other four Meanwhile, let us compare and contrast this “can’t do” attitude with that of this father in Vietnam who drags his son across a raging, muddy river in a plastic bag so he can get to school, before ing to his remote village to work.A couple of years ago, we cowered inside a friend’s French holiday home as hailstones the size of golf balls rained down outside.Oh how we laughed . . . until I remembered our hire car parked outside.It was peppered with more dents than a Swiss cheese and, because we hadn’t taken out the “full insurance”, left us with a bill that cost more than the actual holiday.A BRIEF chat in front of the assembled cameras at Wimbledon was all it took for the Duchesses of Cambridgeand Sussexto dispel the long-standing rumours of a spat.Several weeks ago, it was also reported that the Duchess of Cambridge had fallen out with Rose Hanbury, one of her closest friends in the “Norfolk set”.The story has been dismissed as “unsubstantiated rumours” by sources within the Palace but it flared up again when Rose attended the recent Trump banquet without her husbandand was seated in practically a separate postcode to her old chum. Of course, they could kill those rumours stone dead too by being photographed together while out shopping or having lunch.That it hasn’t happened perhaps speaks volumes.AMAL CLOONEY is a well-regarded human rights lawyer who, together with husband George, uses her  to highlight ious liberal causes.So I was rather perplexed to hear – via a -page leaked document – that in  she reportedly gave legal advice to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on how to potentially sabotage the British government’s bid to arrest him.Whether you think Assange’s role in leaking , classied US documents was espionage or heroism, it remains that he was also trying to avoid extradition to Sweden where he faced charges of sexual assault.How, pray tell, does that fit in with liberal values JENNIFER Lopez is  later this month and credits her youthfulness to daily “self-affirmations”.“I tell myself ‘I am youthful and timeless’ every day a few times a day,” she says. It sounds like cliched bull****, but it’s not. Age is all in your mind.”Hmmm. Quite frankly, I could chant her mantra on a loop and never look like this.One suspects that regular exercise, healthy eating and an expensive skincare regime have played their part too.A SMALL number of residents currently living in the swanky London area of Hampstead are up in arms at proposed boundary changes that would place their homes in nearby Gospel Oak.“By severing political ties, you’re disenfranchising many residents,” says one.What they actually mean is: The price of our houses will plummet.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The British boozer is in crisis.More than a quarter of all pubs have closed in the past two decades, from , in  to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics. We are losing three pubs a day. At this rate we will see the end of the British pub within our letime.So I got together with two friends who, like me, had never been in the licensed trade, to rescue this wonderful, warm, welcoming, Grade II listed building so everyone can continue to enjoy it. And I am not alone.I know of whole communities that have got together through crowd funding to save their local, with £.million being raised through internet donations for ious establishments last year.People are coming to realise that we can’t afford to lose these treasured spaces. There is no social network that can beat the pub, particularly in a world so insular where people have their noses in a mobile phone the whole time.It is so important people sit up and have a good chat, whether it is with a stranger at the bar or one of the staff. Workers come in after grafting and want to speak to the barmaid about what a hard day they’ve had, about the van breaking down or the tractor engine blowing up.Pubs often have football teams, darts, dominoes, quiz nights and are a venue where many great bands played their first gigs. In other places you will find a small shop at the local, because the village one has closed.At The Half Moon we sponsor the village cricket team, have Women’s Institute meetings with tea and cake in the morning, charity events and people come to celebrate weddings, birthdays and anniversaries.And no, nanny state meddlers, this isn’t about encouraging drinking, it’s about popping down to the local for a pint once or twice a week, which isn’t going to do any harm.The pub is now a place that families visit and I want everyone to treat it as their home.  My mum is in the garden, my dad helps out and my son Indio comes in to ask our head barman: “Can I have the usual please” — by which he means an apple juice and a packet of crisps.I had noticed pubs closing, but I hadn’t realised the reason until I became a landlady myself. Someone needs to give this industry a break. Landlords and land–ladies can only make tiny margins on the beer they sell, due to the high taxes they have to pay.That’s why I got involved with the Long Live The Local campaign last year to help pressure the Government into freezing beer duty. Everything is trying to kill this incredible part of British culture, whether it’s business rates, beer tax or sugar tax.Our rates are three times the European average and we pay almost  per cent of all beer duty across the EU, while drinking only  per cent of the beer. But the industry employs around , — many of them young people — and puts £BILLION into the economy.I can’t thank The Sun enough for its support in helping our campaign. I don’t think we would have received as many signatures without the help of you, the readers. Thankfully, the Chancellor listened to our case, agreeing in the last budget not to raise duty on beer.Sin taxes are high enough already and I hope the next Prime Minister will give us a break. It was an honour to be named  Beer Drinker Of The Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, which promotes the unique role of the pub in our society.Certainly there is hope that this great institution can survive by changing with the times and adapting to new tastes.  It is amazing seeing all the microbreweries and gin distilleries starting up, with a new generation enthusiastic about real ingredients.The gastro pub movement also offers customers the quality food they desire. We were proud that our restaurant received two AA rosettes for culinary excellence in the first six months.But there is also a need for a pub to be a pub, where customers can come in with their wellies or work boots. At The Half Moon we have good dining on one side and an old-fashioned fireplace that drinkers can gather round on the other.For the first year I was there all the time, but now it’s wiping its own nose, so I go in two or three times a week — it’s my other jobs that pay the mortgage. It’s a great place to wind down, particularly on a Sunday, and it brings me a lot of joy.When I got the lease for the pub, a friend advised me to make sure I stood back once in a while to peer through the windows to see people having a good time. That’s why Britain’s pubs have to be saved.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Acanthamoeba organisms do not generally cause harm to humans , but they can cause a serious eye diseasethey infect the cornea.Symptoms can include:To avoid Acanthamoeba keratitis, never wear your contact lenses when youre coming into contact with water.Never wash contacts with tap water and never swim, shower or use a hot tub while wearing them.Always clean your contacts in lens solution the moment you take them out, or use daily disposables rather than monthlies.Nick Humphreys, , from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, has had to have two operations and is now waiting to have a corneal transplant after contracting a parasite burrowed into his eye.And last week we reported how a mum-of-two from Sydney feared shed lose her eyesight after a parasite burrowed into her eye when she went swimming in her lenses.Meanwhile, a teenager from Cornwall, says she developed a form of chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis , after she contracted the parasitic infection.Skye Wheeler, , says she lives in constant fear that the bug - which is still sleeping in her eye - could cause her to go blind, or even kill her.In this recent case, the woman tested   in her left eye, making her “legally blind”.She was given medication to treat the infection but sadly never regained her vision due to her scarred cornea.The woman later underwent a partial corneal transplant, which improved her eyesight slightly and thre report says she is no longer in pain.The Acanthamoeba infection often travels through undistilled water, soil and even air.Those who use contacts put themselves at riskthey don’t take proper precautions — by removing the lenses before swimming and showering, or using tap water to clean them.According to a poll by YouGov for the sight charity,  per cent of contact lense wearers wear their contacts for longer than the recommended  hours a day, with  per cent saying theyd swum or showered in them.Meanwhile,  per cent said they had slept with contacts in, and  per cent said theyd put their contacts in their mouth to clean or lubricate them."},{"url":null,"title":"inside jeffrey epsteins lolita express private jet prince andrew","story":"New sordid details from le inside Epsteins informally known ‘Lolita Express’ have emerged as former guests recall the mid-air sex lair, complete with padded floors.Photos from Epstein’s long-time personal pilot Larry Visoski and the glossy pages of a sale brochure reveal the jets plush purpose-built interior.The luxury Boeing  aircraft boasts deluxe furnishings, a spacious galley, expansive cabin lounge and a master bedroom.The jets detailed sale prospectus, as seen by The Sun Online, describes the -passenger interior as tailored to enhance the experience during long range travel.Exactly what happened on the flights where Epstein courted his famous friends and underage girls alike, remains a closely guarded secret.But recently resurfaced accounts detail wild orgies and padded floors purposely designed for sex mid-flight.Lavish red velvet chairs and sofas offer the ultimate comfort as he flew between his million-dollar houses across the world.The luxury commercial jet also features a circular shaped lounge filled with sprawling beige chairs, leading to a spacious private bedroom.Inside the room lies a queen size bed, a sitting area, a small desk and study and a private en suite with integrated shower.Sealed inside the mahogany or teak walls are spacious mirrored wardrobes and drawers.A separate dining area comes complete with a galley kitchen for preparing food.Additional window treatments throughout the aircraft are fitted with custom shades behind tinted glass.Its alleged Epstein used his plane to fly underage girls between his residences in New York, Palm Beach, New Mexico and the Caribbean island of Little St James.The playboy billionaire and paedophile has since been accused of having group sex with young girls on the bed he had privately installed.She also alleged her sexually abusing her for years on his private jet as well as his ious homes.Roberts, now , claimed she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew by Epstein in London, New York and the Caribbean.The Duke of York was pictured with his arm around the then -year-olds waist at the home of Ghislane Maxwell -  a personal aide to the financier - in London in  but has strongly denied the claims.A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “It is categorically denied that The Duke of York received massages from unclothed women at any party given by Mr Epstein.”An additional statement read: “The Duke of York has not visited any home of Mr Epstein or met with him since December  when the photograph in Central Park was taken.”Many believe Epsteins pilot Visoski, who flew the financier for  years, knows more about what went on in the skies.In the past the captain has admitted he knew minors were on board, Mail Online reported.However, he said he never suspected Epstein of having sex with them.Regularly posting selfies in front of the jets to his Instagram page, the chief pilot manages the million fleet.Two women who were involved with Epstein in the early s spoke with Vanity Fair on Thursday.One, a former model who was at the time freshly out of college, told the publication of the time Epstein gave her and a group of older men a tour of his jet.She recalled the moment she realised the jets floors were padded, saying: Wow, rich people are weird.I was so stupid and naïve—Why are padded floors cool  I was too young to get it.She added that the other men winked and joked with each other, knowing the floors were designed so that Epstein could have sex on the floor at , feet.Epsteins wealthy friends often travelled with him on his private jet, dubbed the “Lolita Express” by the Press.On the plane, with bed aboard, Epstein is said to have hosted wild orgies as he flew to his houses in New York, Florida and New Mexico and to his own Caribbean island of Little St James.Flight logs reveal he flew former US president Bill Clinton, actor Kevin Spacey, model Naomi Campbell and Prince Andrew aboard the Boeing .A Clinton spokesman yesterday said he only took four flights and insisted he knew “nothing about the terrible crimes”.US President Donald Trump also hobnobbed with Epstein, saying in a  interview: “I’ve known Jeff for  years. Terric guy.“He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautul women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”Prosecutors allege Epstein amassed a “vast network” of girls as young as  who he would lure to his homes and sexually abuse.When officers raided his seven-storey townhouse in New York earlier this month, they found rooms stuffed with sex toys and thousands of pictures of naked women and girls.On Monday, a dishevelled Epstein, wearing a blue prison-issue unorm, appeared at a court in Manhattan and pleaded not guilty.His attorneys argued the case is a “do-over” of the  Florida case, which saw him serve  months in prison.Back then, police had launched an investigation after a -year-old girl told police an older man named “Jeff” had molested her at his home.A plea bargain saw him sign a non-prosecution agreement to dodge federal charges that might have sent him to prison for le.He ended up pleading guilty to minor state charges in Palm Beach and served  months in a private wing of a county jail, mostly on work release.The “sweetheart deal” has since been much criticised and was the subject of an investigation by the Miami Herald newspaper last year.It emerged that authorities had discovered a disturbing teen sex ring — with the same type of allegations that Epstein faces now.Victims told police how they would be led to Epstein’s bedroom to give him massages, before he told them to remove their clothing. It was alleged he would then sexually assault them, paying them up to £ per visit.But the state attorney’s office in Palm Beach declined to pursue the more serious charges, claiming the girls were not credible.Prosecutors feared they would lose at trial, in part due to Epstein’s lawyers dredging up dirt on the victims, including social media posts indicating drug use.Now, following pressure from alleged victims and the media in light of the #MeToo movement, prosecutors are looking again.Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, says his old non-prosecution deal is only binding with prosecutors in Florida.Courtney Wild and Michelle Licata — who were among Epstein’s accusers in the previous criminal case in Florida in  — sat in court for his hearing on Monday.Miss Wild previously revealed she was still a braces-wearing -year-old schoolgirl when Epstein allegedly forced her to perform sex acts.She says she went on to recruit other girls for him, adding: “He told me he wanted them as young as I could find them.“If I had a girl to bring him at breakfast, lunch and dinner, then that’s how many times I would go a day.“He wanted as many girls as I could get. It was never enough.”Lawyer David Boies, who represents a number of Epsteins accusers, said: “We hope that prosecutors will not stop with Mr Epstein.“There were many other people who participated with him and made the sex trafficking possible.”Epstein remains behind bars as his trial continues."},{"url":null,"title":"athens earthquake powerful tremor strikes greek capital sending people running into the streets","story":"Experts say that the earthquake had a . magnitude and caused communication systems to fail.All public buildings in Attica have been evacuated after the earthquake hit at midday today.The epicentre of the quake was  miles northwest of the city and had a focal depth of  kilometres.There are no reports of injuries or damage currently.This comes as ferocious storms ripped through a tourist region in Greece earlier this month, killing at least seven people.Around  others were reportedly injured after gale-force winds rain and freak hail storms struck the Halkidiki peninsula in northern Greece.More to follow...For the latest news on this story keep checking back at Sun Online.Thesun is your go to destination for the best celebrity news, football news, real-le stories, jaw-dropping pictures and must-see video.Download our fantastic, new and improved free App for the best ever Sun Online experience.

She was trying to figure outthere were any suspicious characters on board.”After  hours waiting in the jet on the tarmac the pair were bused to a temporary shelter in the tiny town of Gambo where they got talking.Nick said: “We didn’t know what was going to happen, it could have been the start of World War Three for all we knew.”They grew so close that locals thought they were a married couple, but Diane only realised Nick had feelings for her when the local geology teacher took them up to see a beauty spot and he insisted she stay in the scenic picture.On the bus journey back to their plane after five days on the North Atlantic island the couple shared their first kiss.Nick said: “Diane looked upset and I went to kiss her on the forehead, and she took command. We ended up canoodling so much on the plane, when the air hostess came round with hot towels she said to us ‘cold towel ’”Talking about the musical, Diane, , added: “Watching the kiss up on stage is like renewing our vows. It takes us back to a special time.”The title for the show is taken from the name Newfoundlanders give to visitors - Come From Away.Before jets had the capacity to cross the Atlantic without refuelling they would stop off in Gander, so it had an airstrip big enough to cope with a sudden deluge of Jumbos.It was a part of Operation Yellow Ribbon where nearly  jets were landed in  Canadian airports.The then Mayor of Gander Claude Elliott was faced with the mammoth task of feeding and housing , guests many of whom didn’t speak English.Claude, who has since retired from his post, said: “What we consider the most simple thing in le is to help people.”And they certainly did that.Nicotine gum was brought for smokers stuck on the planes, when locals were asked to donate toilet roll a year’s supply was delivered in a day and a massive birthday party was organised for  Make-A-Wish Foundation children who had been due to celebrate their own special day in Disneyland.For security reasons the passengers were not allowed to take their bags from the hold, so locals donated blankets, clothes, sanitary towels, nappies and tooth brushes.In order to keep the food supplies cool the local hockey rink was transformed into a massive refrigerator and BBQs were loaned for grill night.No matter how many times, the guests offered to pay for food or drink they were always refused.So after leaving  the passengers decided  to make a donation of £, to the town.Even when retired oil executive Nick and retired retail buyer Diane came back for their honeymoon in  a lavish banquet was put on in their honour.It was then that the press learned of their story - but the couple refused to speak to the journalists camped outside their door.Nick explained: “It took us so long to tell our story because we had survivors guilt.Over three thousand people died in the Towers, so over , families were devastated by what happened.“What happened to us  We found someone who made us so happy. We weren’t comfortable with that. Why us ”After Come From Away made its stage debut in  the couple slowly started to realise relatives of people affected by   had taken to this story of human kindness.Among them is Hannah O’Rourke, a passenger featured in the musical whose firefighter son Kevin died saving  lives in the World Trade Centre.In the show we see her being comforted by a local as she waits to learn of his fate.Nick, who has become friends with Hannah, said: “At one of the openings last year I was sat next to the daughter of Kevin O’Rourke, and when it got to the very sad part of the play I reached out to her and she held on to my hand until the end of the play.”Come From Away is now on at the Phoenix Theatre in London.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her legacy speech typied her time as Prime Minister: Empty, uninspiring, forgettable, plodding and meaningless. If she was leaving the Big Brother house and they had to show her ‘best bits’ there would be an embarrassed silence before going to the adverts. Her actual legacy is three years of stubborn dithering that left Britain in a worse state than when she took over. Or rather, left us with Boris Johnson. Which is a bit like leaving a floater in the toilet at No. When historians describe her premiership, they won’t need to list her failures, like the botched general ­election or the Brexit red-lines ­shambles.    They won’t need to mention the falling letters during a conference speech or the P from a prankster. All they’ll need to write is the name of the least competent minister in the history of politics, whom she refused to sack: Chris ­Grayling. That, alongside a photo of his gormless mug, will perfectly capture how Britain became the laughing stock of the world. Even his name, Failing Grayling, was an era-defining moniker. This was the man who delivered more limp ­disappointments than a crate of snide Viagra.And as the minister also known as Mr Bean II, The Phantom Ferry Man, or Frank Spencer With a Condom On His Head – as he has always appeared to me – leaves the front benches, we need topay tribute.Because as the Shadow Attorney General Karl Turner noted during Grayling’s final Transport Questions session on Thursday, he was “the gt that kept on giving”. The problem was most of what he gave away went to private firms. Labour produced figures that showed his errors cost British taxpayers £.billion. Say that slowly. Two billion, seven hundred million pounds. In cock-ups. Which could have built five state-of-the-art hospitals serving city-sized populations. His greatest mishits included wasting £bn on the collapsed Virgin Trains East Coast franchise, almost half a billion on a bungled probation service privatisation and £million on a contract to a ferry company that didn’t own any ferries.

There should be a new and sincere attempt to reach a consensus.    Hinting at the prospect of another referendum, he told Le Monde and Suddeutsche Zeitung: If we do not find a solution with the members, we may have to ask the British to give their opinion again, in one form or another.

At another visit by housing association officials, she said her father had been taken to Scotland by a carer but refused to say where. In  she feigned dementia and claimed a care package from Halton Borough Council. Hannah Bazley, , the girlfriend of McGill’s son Anthony, pretended to be her carer.

The -year-old, who is dubbed tightapos by her pals also s full-price items as soon as they go into the sales and then buys them again at the reduced price. Virtual assistant Lucy said: My mates say that I’m tight, but I say I’m just thrty. I’m obsessed with making savings – it takes over your le. I do spend a lot of time on my phone. I would say about two to three hours a day looking for offers. My husband tells me off quite a bit for it.    I’ve always been a bit of a bargain hunter and started trying to save money when I was in my early s. My sister used to sell a lot of stuff on eBay, so I started doing that, then it went on from there. But itaposs only in the last few years that Lucy, who is married to Chris, , and mum to Abbey, six, and Owen, nine, has come into her own as a coupon fan and bargain hunter. She said: I’ve been taking it more seriously for the last couple of years. I discovered you could save quite a lot of money by using coupons.With Facebook you can join all these dferent money saving groups, with people looking for bargains or saving tips, she said.Years ago I would cut supermarket coupons out of magazines and now you can find them online and from using dferent apps on your phone. There are receipt scanning apps, where you enter your receipt and get so many points then they send you vouchers. I’ve had Amazon vouchers which I’ll end up saving for Christmas.  I search ‘latest freebies’ and you can get all sorts – food, make-up, toys, as well as skincare samples. I will sign up to do product testing. By doing that, St Tropez sent me a full-size fake tan bottle worth £. And one of Lucyaposs top tips is to join groups which alert thrt shoppers to bargains. She regularly uses Try It, which tells users when emails are going out offering freebies, the Ashleigh Money Saver websites, which informs members about sales or deals offered by retailers and Reward Me Now app – which lets you buy a code to get discounts of up to  per cent – which can be used alongside other offers. Lucy was thrilled when she saved £ just by using the vouchers to buy dinner and drinks in her local pub. She said: I get such a buzz when I see a bargain. Last Christmas I got some dressing gowns for £ each and they reduced the price two days later, so I took them back and got a refund, then bought them again for £.. Most of my friends say, ‘Oh I wouldn’t dare to do that,’ but I’m saving money, so why wouldn’t I  It was £. to spend on something .    I willthings evenbuying them again in the sale only means saving a couple of pounds, because I would rather have that money back. I’ve ordered things online before, then realised two days later they have reduced the price, so Iaposve ordered them again at the cheaper amount and sent the originals back to get a full price refund. Lucy has even managed to get her weekly shop down to £ for a family of four, which works out at just under £ a day. She uses offers and the Feed your Family for Around £ a Week Facebook page and with careful meal planning, saving more than £, a year. Lucy said: Some people say they don’t have time to do it, but it doesn’t have to take a long timeyou plan carefully. Before I go shopping I will check online for offers, check the apps and then decide what supermarket to go to. I’m thinking about what I’m going to do for the kids’ tea throughout the week and how many meals I can make from something. Nothing is wasted. I cook stuff like Bolognese from scratch, working out how much we will eat and freezing the rest. If we have a chicken we will use everything – we’ll even use the carcass for stock for a soup. You can also buy fresh vegetables for just as little. You can find them for p.    I go to the local butcher who often has offers on, too, and stock up, putting items in the freezer. It’s great, as I’m saving money and the kids are eating healthily. It’s just about being organised and being savvy. I used to spend about £ a week and I’ve managed to reduce that by £ which really adds up over a year. And it isnapost just the food shop where Lucy saves a fortune - sheaposs also the queen of booking cheap holidays.  She said: We shop around for the cheapest deal. We managed to get a holiday this summer for four people for £, – flights and accommodation in Benidorm and that’s during the school holidays, when things are at their most expensive. I was speaking to someone at the school gates who was spending £, to £, on their familyaposs summer holiday, so we’ve saved lots of money. We book flights separately using dferent websites to look for cheaper ones and self-catering accommodation in quieter, more residential areas. We then budget to spend  euros a day. We donapost eat every meal out and buy food from the local supermarket, which saves a lot of money.  I’ll book activities online before we go, too. My husband found you could go on one site and book activities in advance, paying  euros instead of  euros at the resort. When it comes to having the perfect family Christmas, Lucy is already organised by July - including wrapping all her presents. She said: I do most of my Christmas shopping in the January sales. I’ve got an airing cupboard full of stuff all wrapped up, which is a bit of a nightmare. I also get birthday presents, sothe kids end up going to a party they have a gt already. I make a note of all the things I’ve bought so I don’t forget. Friends will spend £ to £ per child at Christmas, while I don’t really have a budget, but I try and keep it below £. Having things bought and wrapped takes so much of the stress out of it. Friends will go out on Christmas Eve to get presents and I can’t think of anything worse than doing that. I’ll also collect make-up samples, which make great little gts, and looking out for free items you get with magazines. Quite often you’ll pay £ for the magazine and get a mascara worth £, so I’ll go to dferent shops to buy the same magazine but with a dferent gt. I am bargain crazy andI see a shop closing down I’ll have a really good look for stuff. I want to seeI can get stuff for as cheap as possible.  I will pay full price occasionally, but very rarely, andI can I will get it discounted. I have no idea how much I save, but I think it must be thousands of pounds, especially when you take into account the savings on holidays. I get stuck with the label of being tight, butI can save money that will go into my savings - meaning we can take the kids on a nice holiday, so it’s worth doing.” Lucy’s top five tips: . Use coupons and cashback websites . Plan your meals for the week . Do not be afraid to take items back. That’s money in your pocket rather than in the retaileraposs till. . Double up by using vouchers and discount codes together. .to get freebies in the post. Lucy said: “Sometimes I won’t remember I’ve signed up to something and then it will turn up on the doorstep.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum traumatised after getting mastectomy","story":"NewsMum, , had chemotherapy and mastectomy only to be told she did not have cancerSarah Boyle, , also underwent chemotherapy and reconstructive surgery before being told she didnt even have breast cancerShareByEd Chatterton:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsRoyal Stoke Hospital Trust has apologised to mum-of-two Sarah Boyle,  \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hospital trust has apologised to a mum who was underwent chemotherapy, a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery - only to be told she never had cancer in the first place. Sarah Boyle, , was left traumatised after bungling doctors misdiagnosed her with triple negative breast cancer at the end of . The hospital only realised their error several months later - after which point Sarah had already received extensive treatment and surgery. The mum-of-two had undergone several rounds of gruelling chemotherapy treatment, a bilateral mastectomy and breast implants at Royal Stoke University Hospital.    In an added blow, she has since learnt her reconstructive surgery may now potentially put her at risk of developing cancer in the future. She has also suffered psychological trauma as a result of her ordeal and also continues to endure ongoing symptoms caused by her treatment. The mum, a call centre worker, made headlines in  after telling how she believed her baby son had saved her le by repeatedly rejecting her left breast during feeding, leading her to suspect breast cancer. She said at the time: If I offered him that booby he would completely freak out, heaposd become extremely distressed and would scream the house down.    He just wasnapost having it. I had no problems with my left breast but every time I tried with my right he would start screaming and get very upset. He wouldnapost go near it. She told how she first noticed a lump in her breast in  but a GP told her it was cyst and nothing to worry about. She had it scanned five times over the course of four years before having Teddy. When he was six months old he rejected her right breast altogether, and she took her fears to the hospital, which scanned her and diagnosed grade  triple negative cancer - a rare, non-hormonal form of the disease. Sarah was also initially told that her cancer treatment may lead to fertility issues, but fortunately she went on to have a second child, Louis, who is now seven-months-old. However, she was unable to breastfeed him due to her treatment. Sarah, who lives in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., with husband Steven, , and her two children Teddy and Louis, said: “The past few years have been incredibly dficult for me and my family.    Being told I had cancer was awful, but then to go through all of the treatment and surgery to then be told it was unnecessary was traumatising. “And while I was delighted when I gave birth to Louis, it was really heartbreaking when I couldn’t breastfeed him. “Asthat wasn’t bad enough, I am now worried about the possibility of actually developing cancer in the future because of the type of implants I have and I am also worried about complications that I may face because of my chemotherapy. “While nothing will change what I’ve been through, I really need some answers on what is being done to make sure nobody  suffers in the same way I have.”  Sarah was aged  when she was misdiagnosed by blundering doctors following the birth of her youngest child. She was later informed by her treating doctor, Mr Narayanan, that her biopsy had been incorrectly reported and it was confirmed that she did not have cancer. Her legal team from Irwin Mitchell says a histopathologist misreported the cells as cancerous when they weren’t.    Sarah instructed specialist medical negligence lawyers to investigate the case Awho have now secured an admission of liability from University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust. Sarah Sharples, a legal expert at Irwin Mitchell solicitors who is representing Sarah, said: “This is a truly shocking case in which a young mother has faced heartbreaking news and a gruelling period of extensive treatment, only to be told that it was not necessary. “The entire experience has had a huge impact on Sarah in many ways. While we welcome that the NHS Trust has admitted to the clear failings, we are yet to hearany improvements have been put in place to prevent something like this happening again.

Crash investigators have released shocking cockpit footage showing the final seconds before the plane ed head first into the the ocean off the coast of Papau New Guinea in September last year.The Air Niugini Boeing - aircraft was preparing to land in stormy weather but missed the runway by ,ft, sending the aircraft heading straight for the Pacic Ocean.One male passenger died while nine others were injured in the crash. Dozens of other survivors paddled to safety.  Moments before the plan sunk into the waters, the co-pilot was heard shouting to the captain: Too low! Weaposre too low! Weaposre too low! Seconds later, the footage cuts off as the plane appears to have ed several feet into the Pacic Ocean. Crash investigators noted the pilots had ignored many pull up warning signs and warning lights as they prepared to land, according to a Papua New Guinea Accident Investigation Commission .  The report stated: The crew were fixated on the task of landing the aircraft and did not notice the visual PULL UP caution alert at the bottom of their PFD. Therefore, theydid not take any positive action to arrest the high rate of descent and avoid landing in the lagoon. In fact, neither of the pilots were aware of the rapidly unfolding unsafe situation. The investigation found that the crew had received similar aural alerts on previous approaches in visual conditions where the aircraft was safely landed. This would have contributed to the perception that the alerts during the accident approach were nuisance alerts, and therefore disregarded them.

Tega Agberhiere, , suffered severe burns to his face in April when he was targeted while out with friends in Waterford, Ireland. The former Tottenham and Crystal Palace academy star was left blinded initially, while also suffering severe burns to his face and thighs. Since the ordeal, he has undergone a number of skin grafts, involving skin from his leg being transplanted to his face, reports Irish Mirror. But he has a haze over his right eye that will probably be there forever.  “I’m recovering and it’s been tough, he said. I’m taking every day as it comes. Tega had been out with two of his friends when the attack happened. The trio were all rushed to University Hospital Waterford before Tega was transferred to Cork. The teenager, an Ireland underage football player, says he is now focusing on recovery and back to doing light training. He hopes to play football in the forthcoming season.    Speaking previously about the agony he endured, Tega said: “I can’t describe it. When I got here I thought I’d never be able to see again. “I % thought I’d never be able to see another thing in my le.” Surgeons are so far happy with how the skin grafts have worked, but Tega has been told the eyesight in this right eye will probably never recover fully. He is trying to be as upbeat as possible, but the pain has been so bad he was forced to miss his accountancy Leaving Cert exam last month.    Tega’s mother, Christy Agberhiere, said that the family were just taking things “moment by moment”. They have thanked all the people who had supported the family through what has been a very, very dficult period. “We are not just taking it day by day, we are taking it moment by moment,” she said. Meanwhile, Arsenal fan Tega was also stunned when he received a signed photo of the squad.

She desperately fled the Kaziranga National Park in north-eastern India, as floods took hold. At least  animals from the park have died in recent days, so when she rushed into a family home and flopped on to a bed to sleep, she was left alone. Home owner Motilal and his family spotted the tiger at around .am and quickly raced outside. The animal got comfy on a bed, resting its head on a pillow and slept for most of the day.    According to the Wildle Trust of India , the animal was first spotted next to a road on Thursday morning, just  metres away from the national park. It is thought she was scared of the traffic and sought refuge in the quiet home. Rathin Barman, who led the rescue operation, spoke to the BBC and said: She was very exhausted and had a nice day-long nap. The great thing was that nobody disturbed her so she could rest. Thereaposs a lot of respect for wildle in this region. The trust hatched a plan to allow the animal to leave the house again safely.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events. I know they were in touch with the community council earlier this year before the event, hopefully theyrsquoll keep up this close relationshipthey come back.Meanwhile, Allan Graham who has lived in the town all of his le said without events such as Transcend, the Innerleithen community has nothing.He added: ldquoThe mills have all gone and what we have is biking, walkers etc. Letrsquos embrace whatrsquos coming to us and make the most of it.Jamie Birks echoed this sentiment adding: ldquoThe town has a real and deserved opportunity to be a national hub for outdoor events such as this. So much talent and experience from so many organisations, coupled with truly amazing natural resources that could make such a positive impact on the town ndashwe all want it.Innerleithen Community Council has promised to pass on the complaints raised at the meeting to event organisers, Scottish Borders Council and Police Scotland.But Chairman Marshall Douglas said the community council ldquostrongly supports the Transcend Bike Festival and will continue to work closely with event organisers to ensure the future success of the event."},{"url":null,"title":"cops-ask-help-catch-boy-racers-galashiels","story":"POLICE in Galashiels have called on a local supermarket to help them catch boy racers.For months there have been reports made about young drivers gathering at the Tesco car park.And now officers have asked the firm to take down registration details to help them track down the culprits.PC James Harrison said: ldquoWe are still receiving calls about boy racers in the car park at Tesco on a Saturday night.ldquoIt seemed to get better for a while, but the problem is still there.

The beds are trimmed neatly with green paths of grass and only the odd weed or two can be seen to peer through the burgeoning beetroot and beans.Often yoursquoll also come across one of the volunteers, the gardener oryoursquore very lucky, one or more of the children who help to tend the plants.The Edible Garden is a community garden nestled in the beautul Tweed Valley at Innerleithen and run by a steering group and volunteers.Its aim is to inspire, motivate and build confidence in adults and children of all ages and abilities to learn how to grow their own food to promote a healthy lestyle, to encourage the community to prevent food waste, reuse recycle to reduce landfill and to reduce their carbon footprint.The St Ronanites are horticulturists turned eco warriors, providing a range of workshops for the community in how to grow, harvest and recycle.Lessons include guidance on composting, propagating, soil preparation, solar power for growing, food preservation, seasonal planting, and bugs pests in the garden, carbon footprint and food waste recycling.The vibrant goings-on have recently stepped up a gear with the efforts of the steering group of Shirley Spence, Lisa Kurowski Leslie and Alex Smithson to win a share of the Tweeddale Localities Bid funding.This has secured the future of the garden for years to come and means that the sht of responsibility from the climate change group lsquoYou Can Cookrsquo to the independent body known as lsquoThe Edible Gardenrsquo is now complete.Shirley Spence said the support of the public and the staff and children of St Ronanrsquos Primary School have been crucial to this success.ldquoIt will allow the steering group to provide a part-time gardener, Alex Smithson, serve the schoolrsquos Eco Group with practical experience of environmental issues and fund the supply of equipment, compost and building materials for the foreseeable future.However, for those of you who have yet to find the garden, perhaps it would be helpful to whet your appetite with some details of what the project has accomplished so far.Firstly, as well as offering expert gardening advice to the supporters, Alex plans and prepares the crops and liaises with school staff to provide classes for the children to teach them about their environment and carbon footprint.The classes look at areas from recycling and horticulture to microbes and ecology. This educational programme and the informal weekly gardening clubs allow both adults and children to experience a connection to nature in a supported environment and take home some of the produce theyrsquove grown too.Shirley explained: ldquoAll of the children at the school benefit from the fruit and vegetables grown in the enclosed garden but also from the orchard and the fruit bushes at the schools entrance. They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though.

They have agreed to continue to sponsor the Edible Garden to ensure that it thrives in the future.bull The Allotment ndash The Edible Garden, Innerleithen, will now be working with The Allotment, Innerleithen, who are sponsors.

ldquoWe are delighted that the National Museum of Scotland has been able to lend us items that were either once personal belongings of Scott or things admired by him, allowing us to showcase these stories for local people to enjoy.ldquoScott had loved stories of shipwreck and survival since he was a child and he seized upon the opportunity to visit the birthplace of Alexander Selkirk, the real castaway who inspired Daniel Defoersquos Robinson Crusoe.ldquoHe was shown some of the items salvaged from Selkirkrsquos time on the island, including the coconut cup we have on display.ldquoScott was so impressed that he arranged for the coconut cuprsquos rim to be banded with silver, and for the addition of the rosewood stand.ldquoOther items, such as the pony bridle and Scottrsquos pipe are more personal to Scott and give us a glimpse into his le.ldquoThe funeral invitation also highlights how revered Scott was in his day, with locks of his hair kept as sentimental relics.ldquoWilliam Paterson, one of the builders of Abbotsford and recipient of the invitation, appears to have acquired a generous amount!ldquoAs part of our working relationship with the National Museum of Scotland, we have loaned the Museum items for its new exhibition Wild and Majestic: Romantic Visions of Scotland, which shows the pivotal role Scott had in popularising the defining images of the

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal.

A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

councillor noted that a number of businesses were very quiet during the tournament but acknowledged that the success of the competition could leave a positive long-term impact.She said: ldquoYou have to look at both sides and that is definitely my stance.ldquoIn the shorter term, people have bills and rent to pay and are running businesses.ldquoIt is alright for tourism and economic development to

I think it was a very good thing for the area.ldquoI think it would be fair to say it did not have a major impact on the village of Dirleton itself but, speaking as a community council for the other

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abour how Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10154213.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

Not that it would have made much dference. Unlike the French player who had sobbed uncontrollably after conceding the menrsquos doubles final, the Swiss maestro is made of sterner stuff. Of course being worsted must have been hard. The ferocity of the game spoke to how much each player wanted to win. As the football pundits like to say, this pair left nothing in the changing room, throwing their hearts and souls into combat, and playing through a level of exhaustion only marathon runners can fully comprehend.In a previous age, a duel of this signicance would have resulted in one contestant being carried, mortally wounded, off the field. From that perspective, Federerrsquos defeat ndash a silver salver and a substantial cheque ndash is still victory of a sort. In a gracious speech, he acknowledged Djokovicrsquos brilliance.

Tanera is the only Scottish island to operate a year-round private postal service.A letter posted on Tanera must therefore bear two stamps: a Summer Isles stamp to carry it from Tanera to the mainland post office in Achiltibuie, and a Royal Mail stamp for the rest ofits journey.Tanera Mor was the location that provided inspiration for Frank Fraser Darlingrsquos book Island Farm. The pagan-cult island of Summerisle featured in the film The Wicker Man is thought by some film critics to be set in the archipelago, although the movie itself was filmed in Galloway and Plockton.The island is home to ious protected species including the European otter, and it has flora unusual for the area because there are no sheep, rabbits or deer to feed on it.Tanera Mor was bought in  by English hedge fund tycoon Ian Wace for pound,, ndash far less than the pound. million asking price when it was originally put on the market in .Mr Wace, who has a reported net worth of poundm, is overseeing a four-year programme of improvements on Tanera Mor which could see it become an idyllic retreat capable of hosting up to  paying guests.On the mainland, young eco warriors have been cleaning up their area ina bid to eradicate plastic and other waste from the sea.

Donald Trumprsquos racism is about as subtle as his quf and always has been. But increasingly we are seeing Republicans delight in his racist tirades: his approval ratings among party members rose by five per cent in the wake of the tweets. A president whorsquoll boot political correctness to kingdom come  They couldnrsquot get enough of him.In three years, Mr Trump has transformed the Republicans from the big tent party of Reagan and Bush, into a suspicious, mistrustful, angry sect. He has torn off the veneer and revealed the seething resentment underneath. He has revelled in it and is now seeking to use it to propel himself all the way back to the White House.And he has done this almost entirely with words. Simplistic, inaccurate, often downright absurd words. Petulant words. Self-pitying words. Words that, in their very inarticulacy, resonate deeply with voters alienated by the high-flown oratory of Barack Obama. Words that respect no boundaries. If Mr Trump is an iconoclast, then political correctness is lying smashed at his feet.Will it be mourned  Well, it certainly should, because without it, we are sliding back to the s. In the UK too, where the Prime Minister-in-waiting Boris Johnson has bated Muslims just to endear himself to an increasingly radicalised Tory Party membership, considered speech can no longer be taken for granted, even at the highest levels of politics in its place is polemic and sneering derision.It is tempting to argue that the PC police had gone too far, that nursing hurt feelings had become a full-time occupation for some and that public officials were taking matters too far. Perhaps. Banning all religious references in childrenrsquos ldquoChristmas plays is one example. But snagging on these passing headlines is to miss the bigger picture and the real signicance of this phenomenon: language is one of the only weapons against hate that we have. If we abandon kind and respectful language, then vicious words and deeds will surely follow. Itrsquos already happening.In the st century, political correctness has been co-opted as a term of abuse to dismiss anyone, particularly those advocating for women, the disabled, ethnic minorities, transgender people or other traditionally marginalised groups, who suggest that we should exercise some thought about the words that spew from our lips. As such, it is a source of the most volcanic irritation for many people. Yoursquove heard the sort of thing. They donrsquot see why they shouldnrsquot be allowed to say what they want Britain is a free country isnrsquot it  Frankly they wouldnrsquot be at all surprisedthere was an EU regulation outlawing the habit of calling waitresses ldquolove. And in fairness, like many of us, they are afraid of inadvertently falling foul of the rules and being branded a bigot for getting the terminology wrong. But at its heart, political correctness upsets people because examining the words we use and the assumptions we make about others forces us to confront our knee jerk beliefs about them. And those might not be quite as kindly as wersquod like to think.That is why it matters. Anyone can incubate prejudice without meaning to after all many of us, to some extent, live in a bubble, whether racial or social or economic. It does no harm to examine our beliefs from time to time.We just need to relax about it. After all, most of us exercise political correctness in our personal lives every single day.Because what is being PC except editing the thoughts that spring to your mind before they exit your mouth, so as not to cause unnecessary hurt  Itrsquos just showing consideration by another name. We all do it all the time. Most of us, seeing a friend in the street, would resist the temptation to comment on her expanding girth. Mothers and fathers donrsquot usually tell their kids that their singing is a bit rubbish. Wersquove all received gts that have made our hearts sink but only a truly malevolent soul would drop the china unicorn into the bin right in front of Auntie Sue. We exercise self-control to protect other peoplersquos sense of self-worth. And extending that courtesy to strangers helps to protect them in the same way in an increasingly hostile world.Some see all this as a veneer, arguing that kind words donrsquot necessarily denote kind thoughts.Undeniably. But kindness and consideration in our language, when all public figures adhere to the same rules, provide a sort of herd immunity by making it socially unacceptable to voice your darkest impulses in public. When this consensus is abandoned by the likes of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, the prejudice lurking beneath is validated and the bigotry normalised.Mr Trump and Mr Johnson, who both spin themselves as honest and open, are in truth cynical and manipulative. Mr Trump knows that endorsing racial prejudice will galvanise his supporters and might win over some Democrats in marginal states, and Mr Johnson has been playing a Tory membership that believes overwhelmingly that parts of the UK are under Sharia law.The invasion of the public space with racist, misogynist, anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTI views ndash views that some of us had dared believe were in terminal decline in supposedly advanced democracies like Britain and the US ndash is a reminder that progress is not linear.The property mogul from New York has gloried in abandoning the consensus around measured, respectful language. He canrsquot be allowed drag us all with him.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmA community choir group of all abilities gathered, this morning, in front of St Magnus Cathedral to launch OIC#s new Learning Disabilities Strategy.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The rebels fear this will happenthe new Prime Minister – ie Boris Johnson – is unable to muster enough votes from MPs to allow a no-deal Brexit, which is what will happen unless there is a breakthrough in the EU talks or a further delay.That’s the same no deal which, according to the Government’s own advisors, the Office for Budget Responsibility, will push the UK into a recession and force the Government to almost double public borrowing next year to £ billion, with an even bigger debt mountain to follow in -.: Brexit: MPs vote to block suspension of parliament to force through no-dealThe rebels don’t want Parliament to be suspended because this would mean they would be unable to bring down the Government, forcing a general election at which the people of Britain would be able to vote for candidates who support or oppose a monumentally foolish no-deal Brexit. A Government suspending democracy to avoid losing a vote in the Commons and a vote by the country, so that it can force through a policy that will trash the UK economy  Pardon  This rebellion was odd only because it was necessary.But Jeremy Hunt, the other candidate in the one-horse race to be next Conservative leader, managed to add an extra touch of the surreal when he accidentally failed to vote – while stressing he would have voted with the Government because it would be wrong, he claimed, for Parliament to “restrict the hand of an incoming Government in this way”. Just to be clear, his stated position is that it would be wrong to suspend Parliament and he wouldn’t do thatelected leader. So Hunt would have voted to allow something he doesn’t approve of, but didn’t.Four other Cabinet ministers, including the Chancellor Philip Hammond, also didn’t vote, but appear to have not done so deliberately, helping the rebels to win a vote that blocks suspension of Parliament – although only while there is no devolved government in Northern Ireland.Meanwhile, Johnson waved a kipper about to make a probably inaccurate point about EU regulations.

It’s a definite maybe from the First Minister!Notwithstanding his attempt to eat his words, he had been caught off guard, and had said what a growing number of people believe to be true: independence is a question of when, not .Since the European referendum in , people across Wales have seen the Westminster parties tie themselves in knots over what version of Brexit they want to push through.: Gordon Brown launches think tank with warning Boris Johnson could end Union: Benelux could be model for Scotland, Wales and England after independence, says Plaid Cymru leaderThis chaos has been a plague on the houses of both Labour and the Tories, and more and more people are looking on in horror, questioning whether this really is as good as it gets.But of course, the truth is this didn’t start in June . It started long before then, with a depressing democratic deficit which sees the interests of both Wales and Scotland side-lined.That the interests of the peoples of our two nations, and indeed the wills of our respective parliaments, can be ignored in favour of Westminster’s own interests is no new phenomenon.It is, sadly, a part of le in this United Kingdom.Indeed, it was the democratic deficit itself which drove Brexit itself. The result of the first European referendum was, in my view, the wrong answer to the right question. The question being: why are our voices not being heard by the powers that be What the past three years have shown is that the land of milk and honey promised by the leaders of the Leave campaign was never possible. Indeed, any version of Brexit would wreak unimaginable damage on Wales and Scotland, risking thousands of jobs and crucial investment in our communities.That risk increases exponentially when the next British Prime Minister takes office next week. If, as expected, Boris Johnson does indeed become Prime Minister, the occupant of  Downing Street will be a man who relishes the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.He is a man who has talked openly about cutting Scottish spending and seizing control of regional economic policy – rather than allowing spending decisions affecting Wales and Scotland to be made in our respective countries.Let us be in no doubt that these are very serious times which require all of us to think very seriously and soberly about the kind of future we want for our nations.The choice we face has rarely been starker. On the one hand, the insular, narrow nationalism of the British establishment and its obsession with delivering a nightmare Brexit come hell or high water. And on the other, a bright, prosperous future as independent nations at the heart of Europe.I know what I would prefer.More and more people are realising the sad truth that the current set up of the United Kingdom is incapable of serving either of our nations well.One such person is, of course, the de facto Deputy Prime Minister David Lidington, who penned a memo which said that Wales feels “failed” by Westminster. Indeed, he said that “we cannot be complacent about Wales’s attitude to the Union and independence”.His answer  To improve the “branding” on the few projects in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland that are funded by the UK Government.He sees that Westminster has failed us. He sees the series of infrastructure projects cancelled. He sees the fiscal gap. And yet he fails to do anything to remedy the situation.His shallow response exposes the contempt in which the British establishment holds our two nations. ‘Slap a union flag on it,’ he might as well have said, ‘that’ll pacy them’.Post-independence, our closest friends and allies will always be the other nations of the former UK, but let us not be fooled into thinking that the UK as it stands is a partnership of equals. It isn’t.In a speech in Edinburgh a couple of weeks ago, I proposed that the independent nations of Wales, Scotland and England adopt a model of cooperation based on the Benelux countries.That would be a kind of post-independence union – a voluntary association of sovereign nations, sitting above each independent nation. It could include shared institutions such as a parliament, council of ministers, and court, all in addition to the respective national institutions.Such a model would foster a more equal and congenial partnership between our nations than could ever be possible within the United Kingdom.When Wales and Scotland do choose an independent future – and it is only a matter of when – I also happen to believe England would benefit from an equal partnership as much as our two countries.This ongoing Brexit psychodrama has put the UK on hold: standing still, rudderless, without effective government. It is fraying, not just at the edges, but right through its body politic. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is moving on.This won’t go on much longer. People can only take so much before they choose a dferent, better path. For both our countries, that path can only lead to one future: independence.

For the le of the planet no amount of money can compare to what mother nature gives us.Earth#s nemesis is our banking systems and what they represent.As the Bibles says Timothy ,  # For the Love of Money is the root of all kinds of evil #.I#d very much like to read the rest of Johan Adamson#s comment but can#t find it here.Involving children in the spread of propaganda mirrors the ways of Chairman Mao and his #cultural revolution#. It is an increasing trend in UK and one we should surely reject.So, instead we should indoctrinate them in the ways of continued, pointless consumerism that is managing to waste resources and destroy the environment  Why is this behaviour any more #normal#  These are intelligent young people who know their own minds, ones who can be bothered to get up and make their voices heard.I didn#t advocate consumerism though. Children should not be pushed into anything, including consumption.The reason the older generation are skeptical, they#ve seen it all before.You#ve been reading the Mail again, Ali!For goodness sake, Brian, learn some basic simple science and stop the socialist dogma. Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point.

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations. The company had plans to sustainably grow their fish production levels over the next few years by #expanding into new high-energy farming areas located further offshore#.Bill Whyte, convener of the Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board, said he welcomed Mowi#s recognition of the wild salmonid habitats and added: #We will expect further clarity about the process of biomass relocation. However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

Of course theres expectation and pressure but everyones here to wish me well. Its not like an intimidating atmosphere - people want me to perform and do my best - so Ill try and use that energy. Its a bit like the Ryder Cup in many ways, in that people are pulling for you. I got on that first tee on Tuesday and it felt like that there was , people there. I was nervous then so I can only imagine what itll be like on Thursday. And the -year-old hinted that he would like to see more traditional north coast weather to really test the worlds best golfers. We need a little something, he said. Four days of weather like weve had to date and this place will get torn apart like any links course would. Theyre built for the wind and the weather. The th at The Open championship is my favourite walk in the world - to do it at Portrush late on Sunday, thered be nothing like it. Ill have to play well and well see what happens.

I think the middle of last season I had that conversation with myself, admitted the Rathmore club man. I said, hey,you continue to play the way youre playing this game is going to be gone a hell of a lot quicker that you thought. Whats that going to feel like  I think coming to that realisation helped me because it made me start to embrace the challenge a little bit more, enjoy the time I have left out here.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry. George was educated at Campbell College in Belfast and began a career in banking after emigrating. He enlisted in the th Canadian Battalion at the rank of Liuetenant on November ,  and later transferred to the th Canadian Battalion.  He saw action at the Somme in July,  and in April,  at Vimy Ridge where he was wounded and suffered injuries to his left femur and left foot. He was demobilised in July,  and ed to Canada where he became a farmer.CAPTION: The Reverend Robert William Ross."},{"url":null,"title":"derry university group says opportunity lifetime north west must seized","story":"The Derry University Group say that civic society has a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity to build a new, dedicated university in the North West.A spokesperson for the group told the Derry News: “This is the opportunity of a letime. There is currently, after years of campaigning, a genuine momentum of support building in Dublin and in London for a new university here.“We need to harness this carefully and creatively, to deliver a standalone Higher Education institution for our city region.“There is a real chance to redress  years of isolation and alienation and to build hope and prosperity for future generations in northwest Ireland.“We must be careful not to be side-tracked into short-term fixes as we have been before. We have an opportunity here to create a legacy that will endure for centuries.”The spokesperson added that the North West must immediately begin revising its current ‘tenuous’ development plans so as to accommodate a new university.“It is a matter of great concern that so much of this region’s future planning centres on promises made by Ulster University, an institution controlled in Belfast and Coleraine, which has consistently failed Derry and northwest Ireland – and has broken promise after promise to this city - over the past six decades.“As regards the long-term planning of the region, it is not acceptable that we do build and deliver our own alternative. Derry and the North West have the capability, the determination and the vision to deliver a better future for ourselves.“It is reckless and perilous to remain entirely dependent on outside institutions that will always, by necessity, serve their own interests and those of their friends first. Why should we continue to acquiesce to those who have failed us, misled us and ultimately alienated us over six dferent decades ”The spokesperson added that a new Derry-centred institution, with a cross-border element under the auspices of the National University of Ireland, could help militate against the impact of Brexit.“Derry Strabane Council needs, as its first priority, to re-draft its City Deal to ensure that it can include a new independent university as its new anchor partner.“Council also needs to engage pro-actively with the Dublin and London governments to enact supporting legislation, and to secure resources, funding other support and accreditation for this new dedicated institution for the North West.“The positive momentum is there. This is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. We have a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity and build a new, dedicated university in the North West.”The Derry University Group, which is based at Ráth Mór, was established in  by Conal McFeely, Diane Greer and Garbhan Downey.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"eamonn mccann derry treated contempt nationalist leadership","story":"By Eamonn McCanngoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe neglect of Derry on both university education and rail links has been blamed for  years on sectarian unionism.There is a great deal of truth in this - but it’s not the whole truth.The same neglect has continued under politicians wearing green jerseys.It is half a century since unionism held sway in these parts.

The committee was headed by Lockwood, who was an English academic. He produced a report on a second university for Northern Ireland he recommended not Londonderry but Coleraine.“Runner-up to Coleraine was the city of Armagh. It was not a sectarian decision it was made by an impartial English academic. It is slanderous to suggest that he was sectarian.”However, alluding to successive decades of underinvestment Mr Adonis yesterday told the Derry News: “No matter what the motives behind these decisions were, the result is that Derry has unfairly lost out and its young people deserve better.“The past should not govern the future. Yet the situation is getting worse not better.”Figures gathered by the Derry News under Freedom of Information legislation, and published last month, show that student numbers in the city actually fell from , in   to , in  .This comes at the same time UU created a new and much larger campus in Belfast city centre at a cost of £-m. The university has attributed a reduction in student numbers and “expansion challenges” in Derry to higher education budget cuts.At Monday’s debate, Baroness OLoan defended Ulster University’s position insisting that the building infrastructure at Jordanstown was not capable of being sustained leaving it with no option but to relocate.UU’s decisionWhile, Lord Empey, a former leader of the UUP, and Minister responsible for further and higher education who dealt with Ulster University at somesaid he supported the proposition of a medical school in Derry.However, he added that the decision of where to invest was down to the university alone and UU “made very clear to us what it wanted to do. It said: we want to rebuild our Jordanstown campus and put it in the centre of Belfast. Will you support us or not “It was not a question of Londonderry versus Belfast—that option was not open. It had made its decision.”Meaningful change can be brought about as a result of this report which, Mr Adonis says, is a signicant first step towards increasing student numbers in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a new university with its principal campus in Derry - \"I hope action will follow,” he added.“It is realistic to believe that Derry can have a standalone university since it is the norm for cities the size of Derry across the UK to have universities of their own. Derry is unusual only in being so acutely disadvantaged. It is scandalous that this issue was not addressed years ago.”Askedhe will continue to advocate on Derry’s behalf, he added: “Absolutely! I will follow the government’s report in September closely and continue to push for Derry to have a university with its principal campus in the city.

But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wN1xcXC8xOTE1NTE1N1xcXC9PZmZsZWFkLTEtcGljLTEwMjR4NzY4LnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjMyN2UwOTU4ZjdmMDJhNzUzYmRkMDJmYWZiY2ZiZTRjNDY2ZjhmZjUifQ==/offlead-1-pic-1024x768.png","title":"rare breed star cahir launches annual agricultural show","story":"A young boy from Dungiven has helped to launch this weekend’s Co Londonderry and Limavady Agricultural Show.Young Cahir McGilligan, who found fame on the recent series of UTV’s Rare Breed, was on hand to launch the show which takes place tomorrow, Saturday, July .Avid farmer Cahir was delighted to be able to help out and is looking forward to participating himself.The annual show, which will be held at Aghanloo, Limavady, will see a number of events taking place throughout the day.These include horse and pony showing and jumping working hunter classes.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshLivestock showingand a fencing competition will also take place.Other attractions include home industries, crafts, vegetables and flowers, fun and games and numerous trade stands and young farmers tug of war.Updates can be found on their Facebook page.Cahir McGilligan is pictured above with the Chairman Mr Alwyn McFarlane and Mr Stanley Warnock who want to encourage everyone to attend the show for a great family day out.  "},{"url":null,"title":"springtown camp monument officially unveiled next month","story":"A monument commemorating the Springtown Camp in Derry will be officially unveiled next month at a ceremony near the entrance to the former site it has been announced.The unveiling will take place on Thursday, August  adjacent to the North West Regional College Training Centre at  noon and will be followed by a Civic reception at the Guildhall at pm.The art installation will take the form of a Nissan hut in which the inhabitants of the camp were forced to live in deplorable conditions because of a policy of housing discrimination in operation at the time against the Catholic community.Springtown Camp was originally a Second World War United States military installation which was vacated after the end of the conflict in the mid-s. Over  families once inhabited Springtown Camp and occupied it around  because of over-crowded living conditions in Derry.The decision to squat in the former military huts, despite the fact there was no electricity, running water or means of heating, came after many families evaluated that these conditions were actually better than they were enduring.The camp became a focal point of the early civil rights agitation in Derry.Willie Deery, who grew up in the camp, said: “This monument is vital because the camp symbolises the precursor to the civil rights marches.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It’s also somewhat ironic because  years after our mother’s were evicted from the Guildhall for protesting against the conditions at the camp there will now be a civic reception for us there.“This will be a recognition for our parents who had to raise their children in shocking circumstances.

Ballynahinch is used as a gateway by visitors to Newcastle and the wider Mournes area in particular and we need to see work on the bypass starting as soon as possible, he said.Cllr Walker argued that the current congestion is hampering new retail and commercial investment in Ballynahinch and believes the provision of the new bypass represents a ldquowin win for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down close in on last four  ","story":"DOWN camogs took another step towards qualication for the semi-finals when they blitzed Carlow at Pairc Esler on Saturday afternoon.The home side started in a hurry and stormed into a - to - interval lead, Carlowrsquos only scores coming from two pointed frees.Down were strong in all departments, but they had the star of the show in Portaferryrsquos Niamh Mallon, who helped herself to -, with only three points coming from frees.Mallon received great support from Castlewellanrsquos Sorcha McCartan who helped set Down on their way with a cracking goal in the th minute to put her side - to - clear.Mallon grabbed Downrsquos second goal just after the break and a double from Catherine McGourty was the icing on the cake as the Downmanagement team emptied their bench.The only negative on the day came when Sara Louise Carr had to leave the action in the first half with what appeared to be a calf injury and she must now be a serious doubt for the big game with Derrry on July .Down sit top of their group alongside Tipperary with Derry only a point behind and a win against their Ulster rivals would surely secure a place in the last four.Down -Carlow -ALL-IRELAND ICC.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C July 17%2C 1979  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN mdash Stormont officials were keeping tight-lipped this week about the prospect of finding new employment for  workers who have been dramatically paid off at two textile factories in the Castlewellan area.Redundancy notices went sent out last week to employees of the Moss Lane Spinning Company in Castlewellan and Standard Mills of Annsborough mdash but there is a chance they may be re-employedmoves to attract a new company to the vacated premises are successful.The official receiver, Mr Noel Stewart, who is the man heading the search for a new owner, said the two factories mdash operating as a joint company mdash had been plagued by ldquocatastrophic losses during the last  months.He stressed that he was optimistic that a new owner will be found and said the Department of Commerce had indicated that it will give every assistance to get the factories open again.A spokesman for the Department would only say that efforts were being made to get factories re-opened, but would not state the level of success.ldquoWe are trying to get another company to move into the premises at Castlewellan and Annsborough, but I am not prepared to say more than that at the moment, he said.Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill, slammed the decision to close the factories and said it was a disaster for the area.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted immediate action to cope with the grim unemployment problem facing the people of Castlewellan and Annsborough.ldquoThe overall situation was poor before this dramatic turn of affairs, but the close of these two factories makes the situation disastrous, he said.ldquoThere is now no worthwhile employment opportunity on any reasonable scale in the area.

I still have so much to learn and improve on, which makes it exciting, she enthused.ldquoOver the next few months I will have to chat with coaches and make a decision on the event I want to focus on the most.I will continue training all five events, but I think my main aim will be the Triathle Worlds in October in Florida.Suzie now feels that the time is right to put her toes into local waters so that she can improve her swimming discipline.ldquoNow Irsquove had a taste of open water swimming, its time to brave the Northern Ireland waters, so I can perfect my technique and become more efficient at sighting and swimming round buoys, she continued.ldquoI will also be back in the gym building on my strength again. Itrsquos an important part of my training which I have to not over do during competition.ldquoI cannot wait for World Championships in Florida, she beamed,ldquoThe competition level will be fierce, so Irsquoll be going with no expectations. My parents couldnrsquot make it out to Madeira, but- luckily it was all streamed live so they could watch it from home.ldquoHowever, they are going to come out to Florida with me. In, fact I think a number of my family and friends will come. Not to see me of course, any excuse for a trip to Florida.ldquoI have only been to New York for a couple of days before so Irsquom excited to see more of America.The competition is in Tampa Bay, which I found out is only a few hours drive from Orlando. I think Irsquom mostly excited about that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Thousands attend Twelfth in Crossgar  ","story":"THOUSANDS of Orangemen, bandsmen and their families travelled to Crossgar for last Fridayrsquos Twelfth of July demonstration when two local politicians were praised for their work in the community.Brethren from host district Lecale were joined by others from Castlewellan, Saintfield, Comber and Ballynahinch and sisters from the Womenrsquos Loyal Orange Lodges and supporting bands for the annual Battle of the Boyne commemoration.During his address at the demonstration field, Grand Chaplain of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, the Rev Dr Stanley Gamble, highlighted the efforts of Rowallane SDLP councillor Terry Andrews and his DUP colleague Billy Walker.Cllr Andrews, who is Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos vice-chairman, attended the parade as a spectator and was delighted to catch up with the Dr Gamble.During his address, the principal speaker asked Orangemen and women to be ldquoactive in their respective communities.

But to be honest people have been remarkably responsible with their litter,” he said. “I think the RA’s initiative of having refillable cups and water points dotted around the course rather than plastic water bottles has made a big dference.”Richard, a member of Royal Portrush for  years, is delighted the biggest tournament in golf is back in his home town.“You just look around and you really have to pinch yourself. You walk around and see Rickie Fowler, Bubba Watson, Jordan Speith, Tiger and guys you only ever see on TV who would normally never be here, it is just phenomenal. There is just a massive feeling of pride in what everybody’s done to bring it here,” he said.“This is massive for Portrush. You just have to look at the town and the money that has been spent sprucing it up, the new train station, even the pavements. The economic benefits are going to be huge.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans.

It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.
