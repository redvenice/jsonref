The stunning venue has attracted a list guests like Jack Nicholson and Michael DouglasAckergill Tower is believed to date from 1475 and over its 500-year history it was often besieged during feuds between Scottish clans.It was extended in the mid-19th century by Scottish architect David Bryce and was restored in the 1980s to its former grandeur.   Businessman Mike Clare, who founded bed retailer Dreams, bought and converted it in 2009 but he is now selling the impressive property.The property currently operates as a country house hotel but has also been an exclusive wedding, party and conference venue in the past.The five-storey tower is steeped in history but has had 21st century luxuries added and has 32 bedrooms, 31 bathrooms and ten reception rooms including the impressive wood-panelled Great Hall.There is plenty of additional accommodation in the 30 acres of grounds, including the converted stables which sleep ten people and Europe\u0027s largest treehouse, which sleeps two.The treehouse is in a 150-year-old Sycamore tree and has a 7ft round bed and a large circular bath, as well as 360-degree views of the surrounding woodland and a \u0027twilight ceiling\u0027 so guests can gaze up at the stars through the tree\u0027s branches.          Private parties and weddings have been held in the wood panelled dining room. The stunning property is near John O\u0027Groats in Caithness, the most northerly point in Scotland          The tower, complete with a huge tree house and 32 rooms, guest houses and seaside cottages is near John O\u0027Groats in Caithness          The tower has classic, executive and deluxe rooms which guests have been enjoying for decades. The castle itself was built 600 years ago           The striking 15th century Scottish castle stands on the shoreline at Sinclair Bay on the northernmost tip of ScotlandThere is also the Smugglers Inn pub, a beautiful Victorian walled garden, a Bothy and a boathouse.It also has a lease of shooting and fishing rights over a neighbouring 3,000 acres.Michael Jones from Knight Frank said: \u0027It\u0027s a totally unique property, the tower is spectacular in itself and the location is also spectacular right on the sea.\u0027It\u0027s currently running as a hotel but for some wealthy people it would be a great place to have a private residence as well - you could certainly do a fair bit of entertaining.\u0027You could use the main castle as your home and use the other properties on the site as guest accommodation when you need it or as holiday rentals.          The tower has attracted some world famous guests including entrepreneur Richard Bransom, Jack Nicholson and Michael Douglas          A treehouse has been built around a 150 year old sycamore tree in the grounds of the luxury tower. The treehouse features a large circular bath, 7ft round bed and use of a microwave and fridge          Fine dining and events have been held at the castle for decades. Weddings and functions are also held at the £3.9m venue            The Ackergill Tower Estate has its own pub called the ‘Smugglers Inn\u0027 which features a log fire and a fully stocked bar for guests to relax in \u0027There\u0027s a whole variety of possible uses and we\u0027ve had a real mix of interest from the commercial sector and private owners.\u0027It looks a long way north, it is at the top of Scotland but there\u0027s an airport nearby and helicopters can land at the castle itself.\u0027It\u0027s got stunning views across the water and it\u0027s a spectacular position on the clifftop.\u0027This is a very rare opportunity. There are one or two Scottish castles that come on the market every year but something in this condition, of this magnitude and location is pretty much a one-off.\u0027I think the last time there were was a property of this calibre on the market was when this was sold ten years ago.\u0027          There is room for ten in the tastefully designed \u0027Smiddy\u0027 with mezzanine level combines traditional architecture with modern equestrian style décor          Ackergill Tower says: \u0027All bedrooms have their own bespoke design and unique character with period details, sumptuous furnishings and all the modern luxuries you need to make the most of your Highland escape\u0027          The tower has numerous bedrooms and self-contained cottages for guests to say in.

Then the Prime Minister swept in wearing a purple dress trimmed in green. ‘The colour of the suffragettes,’ observed one minister who thought it ‘very significant’ in the 100th anniversary of the first women securing the vote. The topic for discussion was a 120-page document on the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) which most had received only the afternoon before. Questions went back and forth rapidly.Someone asked for clarification of some of the figures and Chancellor Philip Hammond answered. Ten minutes later he was still talking, at which point he was cut off by the PM who chided that it wasn’t the time for speeches.As the temperature steadily rose – there is no air conditioning at Chequers, the weekend retreat of every prime minister since the end of the First World War – most people took off their jackets.Even Britain’s bearded ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow, in his trademark three piece suit, stripped down to his waistcoat.Brexiteers blast \u0027snake in the grass\u0027 Gove for backing May\u0027s...Furious Brexiteer Tory MPs demand a vote of no confidence in...Share this articleThen Mrs May asked Julian Smith, the Chief Whip, to speak.‘Oh God,’ said Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary. Quick as a flash, the PM retorted: ‘He’ll like that as an introduction.’ Smith’s assessment was crucial to May’s subsequent victory, because he bluntly warned that without the FCA compromise the Government would certainly lose a Commons vote on July 16 and be forced to stay in the Customs Union. His remarks had a sobering effect. They broke for a buffet lunch, on the sun-drenched patio, of barbecue chicken thighs with a selection of salads made using produce from the Chequers estate. For dessert there were scones and cream and sticky tea loaf.Boris Johnson, a Cabinet heavyweight in more ways than one, was seen prodding the loaf with a fork but resisted taking a bite.At 2pm, they reassembled in the Grand Parlour as the thermometer on the wall hit 27.3C. Windows were thrown open and the Chequers team ferried in chilled Diet Coke and elderflower cordial.For those who needed more of a sugar rush, a bag of Haribo sweets also went round, with Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt photographed ing in, although nothing passed his lips apparently. ‘He’s thinking about his public image all the time,’ observed one source drily.The Prime Minister then spoke for six minutes looking down only occasionally at her notes.‘There was a touch of Elizabeth I about her. Haughty, almost regal, she was confident and assured,’ one minister said admiringly.David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy PM, went next. A former Europe minister, arch Remainer, and fully paid-up cheerleader for May, he banged the drum for the FCA. No surprise there.    The most telling intervention came just after 3pm from Michael Gove (pictured), who said: ‘I feel we should all back the PM and support her in her efforts to make this work’All eyes, however, were on David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, whom May then called to speak. It was a pivotal moment. Davis had little to do with the FCA, which was drawn up by civil servants who now appear to be leading the negotiations. He made clear he disagreed with the plan and warned the EU would come back for ‘even more concessions’. But it was clear that he would accept the majority view.One senior source said: ‘He is a realist who knows we are leaving the EU albeit not exactly on the terms he wanted, and he also relishes his Cabinet role.’ Boris Johnson appeared surprised to be called next. In a six-minute ‘rant’ or ‘whinge’, depending who you spoke to, he despaired that the customs plan had ‘emerged zombie-like from the coffin’.The most telling intervention came just after 3pm from Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary. Stressing that the FCA was not his preferred option and arguing they must make more plans for ‘no deal’, he said: ‘I feel we should all back the PM and support her in her efforts to make this work.’The words had the desired effect. ‘It changed everything,’ said another source. There was a rumble of supportive noises and suddenly the little bubble of rebellion had burst – although critics were determined to have their say.

Get so far in then either kicks you off as your about to pay or just keeps saying there’s been an error.“Be nice to hear of success stories.”Roger Ball said: “Same here. fifa really are a bunch of a*holes for having such a rubbish website especially as they have had plenty of time and money to get it right.“Have spent best part of my Sunday trying to get a ticket off their site.

Any idea what I’m doing wrong or are they just selling before I have change to buy?”Richard Boggis posted: “Same here. I almost got one lunchtime but I had the problem selecting collection now it just says something went wrong even if I try to select medium availability for Tuesday game.“Don’t know if I’m wasting my time. Any advice much needed.”          Manager Gareth Southgate roared with jubilation as the referee signalled full time   England have booked their place in the semi-finals of the Russia World Cup after defeating Sweden 2-0 in SamaraAlthough flights and match tickets will be expensive, fans can still grab themselves a bargain when it comes to accommodation.Single rooms within a few miles of the city centre are available online for less than £20 a night via Trivago with more central options starting at £60 - but some four and five-star Moscow rooms will cost at least £1,000-per night.Match tickets are limited via the FIFA website but are being offered on resale sites.This is because Russians were offered thousands of tickets are face value before the tournament, which they can then sell on.Fans from countries like Germany, Brazil, and Spain, who expected to be in the semi-finals instead of England, are also selling off the tickets they no longer need.    If England fans get a ticket they\u0027ll need to apply for a visa by tomorrow to ensure they can enter Russia in time for the game.  Fans wishing to travel this week will either need a valid visa or a FIFA FAN ID, which acts as a visa for people visiting Russia for the World Cup.Although it\u0027s possible to fast-track a visa application, the shortest time-frame offered online is 72 hours, making it impossible to obtain one before you\u0027d need to fly to Moscow for the Croatia game.You can, however, apply for a FAN ID here, providing you have a ticket number for an upcoming game or one that has already been played.Applications take about 10 minutes and should be approved within 24 hours. You can then either print your FAN ID or collect it in Russia. The document - which includes a unique number and passport-style photo - is also used to enter stadiums and to book free rail travel.              For the very richest people can charter a private jet for at least £22,000 for a one-way tripSaturday’s 2-0 victory over Sweden secured a place in the semi-final in the Russian capital on Wednesday evening.It also guarantees England will play twice more, in that game and hopefully in Sunday afternoon’s final against either France or Belgium, which will also be in Moscow.But even defeat to Croatia in Wednesday’s semi-final would mean playing in the third-place match, which takes place in St Petersburg on Saturday afternoon.  BBC football pundits in Moscow joined in the raucous celebrations. After analysing the match – which was played 500 miles away in Samara– from their studio in Red Square, Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Lineker posted videos of themselves belting out songs in a bar.Egged on by former Germany star Jurgen Klinsmann, Shearer sang Lionel Richie’s All Night Long, using breadsticks as a pretend microphone. Earlier he and his colleagues sang along to the Three Lions anthem. Shearer told fans: ‘It’s coming home. A little bit of a party going on.’The Football Supporters’ Federation predicts that more than 10,000 fans will make the pilgrimage to Moscow for Wednesday’s clash, the first time in 28 years that England have reached a World Cup semi-final. However, many will face problems finding flights, accommodation and – more importantly – match tickets.Some England fans already have tickets for Wednesday’s game as the FA sold an allocation of 2,180 back in January. Thousands more were sold to England fans through world governing body Fifa. A Fifa spokesman said yesterday: ‘Tickets which become available for the remaining matches are sold via fifa.com and it is a dynamic process. It depends on the numbers which are resold by fans who have bought them but no longer want to attend matches.‘We advise fans of availability through a traffic light system of colours. For France v Belgium there were still some available. Those not being used come up for sale automatically.‘There were some in the red zone for England v Croatia meaning they were available but they are now in grey which means they have been purchased. You must have a fan ID issued by the Russian authorities to get a visa to get into Russia.’ Supporters’ chiefs predict the rush for Wednesday’s semi-final will match the last-minute dash to Italy for the 1990 World Cup semi-final against West Germany in Turin. That match ended in tears for England – and star midfielder Paul Gascoigne – with defeat in penalty shoot-out.The only other occasion England reached the semi-finals was on home soil in 1966, on the way to lifting the trophy.England manager Gareth Southgate said yesterday that winning the World Cup in Russia would be an even bigger triumph.‘We’ve talked, touched briefly, on the team which won. How they’re still held and revered,’ he said. ‘Perhaps in the modern era that would be even crazier, social media and everything else, the global thing is so much bigger.’ Captain Harry Kane said: ‘We are not finished yet.

Get so far in then either kicks you off as your about to pay or just keeps saying there’s been an error.“Be nice to hear of success stories.”Roger Ball said: “Same here. fifa really are a bunch of a*holes for having such a rubbish website especially as they have had plenty of time and money to get it right.“Have spent best part of my Sunday trying to get a ticket off their site. Am at the point of giving up. FIFA  hopeless.”Francis Fowles posted: “Tickets are appearing on the FiFA website but I always get a ‘Something’s Gone Wrong’ message after I’ve put the code in.“It’s also asking me to verify the ticket choice. Any idea what I’m doing wrong or are they just selling before I have change to buy?”Richard Boggis posted: “Same here. I almost got one lunchtime but I had the problem selecting collection now it just says something went wrong even if I try to select medium availability for Tuesday game.“Don’t know if I’m wasting my time. Any advice much needed.”          Manager Gareth Southgate roared with jubilation as the referee signalled full time   England have booked their place in the semi-finals of the Russia World Cup after defeating Sweden 2-0 in SamaraAlthough flights and match tickets will be expensive, fans can still grab themselves a bargain when it comes to accommodation.Single rooms within a few miles of the city centre are available online for less than £20 a night via Trivago with more central options starting at £60 - but some four and five-star Moscow rooms will cost at least £1,000-per night.Match tickets are limited via the FIFA website but are being offered on resale sites.This is because Russians were offered thousands of tickets are face value before the tournament, which they can then sell on.Fans from countries like Germany, Brazil, and Spain, who expected to be in the semi-finals instead of England, are also selling off the tickets they no longer need.    If England fans get a ticket they\u0027ll need to apply for a visa by tomorrow to ensure they can enter Russia in time for the game.  Fans wishing to travel this week will either need a valid visa or a FIFA FAN ID, which acts as a visa for people visiting Russia for the World Cup.Although it\u0027s possible to fast-track a visa application, the shortest time-frame offered online is 72 hours, making it impossible to obtain one before you\u0027d need to fly to Moscow for the Croatia game.You can, however, apply for a FAN ID here, providing you have a ticket number for an upcoming game or one that has already been played.Applications take about 10 minutes and should be approved within 24 hours. You can then either print your FAN ID or collect it in Russia. The document - which includes a unique number and passport-style photo - is also used to enter stadiums and to book free rail travel.              For the very richest people can charter a private jet for at least £22,000 for a one-way tripSaturday’s 2-0 victory over Sweden secured a place in the semi-final in the Russian capital on Wednesday evening.It also guarantees England will play twice more, in that game and hopefully in Sunday afternoon’s final against either France or Belgium, which will also be in Moscow.But even defeat to Croatia in Wednesday’s semi-final would mean playing in the third-place match, which takes place in St Petersburg on Saturday afternoon.  BBC football pundits in Moscow joined in the raucous celebrations. After analysing the match – which was played 500 miles away in Samara– from their studio in Red Square, Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Lineker posted videos of themselves belting out songs in a bar.Egged on by former Germany star Jurgen Klinsmann, Shearer sang Lionel Richie’s All Night Long, using breadsticks as a pretend microphone. Earlier he and his colleagues sang along to the Three Lions anthem. Shearer told fans: ‘It’s coming home. A little bit of a party going on.’The Football Supporters’ Federation predicts that more than 10,000 fans will make the pilgrimage to Moscow for Wednesday’s clash, the first time in 28 years that England have reached a World Cup semi-final. However, many will face problems finding flights, accommodation and – more importantly – match tickets.Some England fans already have tickets for Wednesday’s game as the FA sold an allocation of 2,180 back in January. Thousands more were sold to England fans through world governing body Fifa. A Fifa spokesman said yesterday: ‘Tickets which become available for the remaining matches are sold via fifa.com and it is a dynamic process. It depends on the numbers which are resold by fans who have bought them but no longer want to attend matches.‘We advise fans of availability through a traffic light system of colours. For France v Belgium there were still some available. Those not being used come up for sale automatically.‘There were some in the red zone for England v Croatia meaning they were available but they are now in grey which means they have been purchased. You must have a fan ID issued by the Russian authorities to get a visa to get into Russia.’ Supporters’ chiefs predict the rush for Wednesday’s semi-final will match the last-minute dash to Italy for the 1990 World Cup semi-final against West Germany in Turin. That match ended in tears for England – and star midfielder Paul Gascoigne – with defeat in penalty shoot-out.The only other occasion England reached the semi-finals was on home soil in 1966, on the way to lifting the trophy.England manager Gareth Southgate said yesterday that winning the World Cup in Russia would be an even bigger triumph.‘We’ve talked, touched briefly, on the team which won. How they’re still held and revered,’ he said. ‘Perhaps in the modern era that would be even crazier, social media and everything else, the global thing is so much bigger.’ Captain Harry Kane said: ‘We are not finished yet. We want to go all the way.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/09/13/4E0F3BA100000578-5933431-At_one_point_Cherie_also_known_as_Mark_Swift_plants_a_kiss_on_an-m-3_1531140228288.jpg","title":"Hilarious moment drag act interrupts Glasgow wedding singing me","story":"    In the clip Cherie Trieffel bursts into Saint Luke\u0027s church and belts out \u0027it should have been me\u0027  At one point Cherie, also known as Mark Swift, plants a kiss on an amused guestHow NOT to get a woman\u0027s attention: Man who finds stranger\u0027s...Horrifying moment a huge spider appears on a woman\u0027s...Share this articleIn the clip, Cherie is seen battering the grooms with her handbag and kissing a stunned guest.

Beyond advances in the manufacture of clothing, the whims of fashion, and the occasional fad – who remembers Levi’s twisted seam? – cotton has remained cotton, and polyester is still polyester.But an award-winning Italian design duo is trying to realise the potential of smart technology in clothing to improve lives.Emanuela Corti and Ivan Parati, who met while studying at the Polytechnic University of Milan, have developed Sensewear, a collection of smart clothing and accessories for people who suffer from SPD. Also known as sensory integration difficulties, SPD can affect the way people, particularly those on the autism spectrum, process everyday stimuli, from light to touch.Their innovative work won Corti and Parati an AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award as part of the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme, which aims to identify inidual champions, innovators and organisations that are creating exciting and pioneering health tech. In addition to winning awards, Corti and Parati’s work has also gained the attention of research academics and manufacturers in Italy.“If it is not treated effectively, it can result in clumsiness, behavioural problems, anxiety, depression or failure at school,” says Corti, a product designer specialising in textiles and furniture. She says hypersensitivity is often part of SPD, which can result in an enhanced sensitivity to sounds, smells and physical contact. “The textures, stitches and labels in regular clothes can cause unsustainably painful reactions,” she says. Left untreated, these symptoms can be disabling, leading to social isolation, anxiety and low self-esteem.The couple, who now have a young daughter, started with comparatively low-tech solutions, looking at the potential for 3D knitting processes, for example, to reduce potential rubbing points. They also looked at ways to redesign – or to build into clothing – some of the specialised toys and medical accessories already available. “Our focus was on incorporating those therapies into everyday objects that would not stigmatise the user as a disabled person,” Corti says. “We wanted to create invisible magic.”But the designers also wanted to think big. What if the elements of a wardrobe could talk to each other? For this, Corti and Parati looked at some of the smart clothing that is starting to become available, typically now targeted at the fitness market, such as Nadi X smart yoga leggings, which pulse on different muscles to encourage correct positions, and the sports vests that measures an athlete’s heart rate and position.“Our smart T-shirt will collect vital data – such as heart rate, breath frequency and movement – which is processed by an app to indicate the stress level of the wearer. It can then trigger the functionalities of other garments in the collection,” says Corti.One such garment is an inflatable pullover, capable of delivering a targeted “hug” to a wearer in need. “Deep pressure or deep touch pressure therapy (DTP) is a firm, tactile sensory input that can consist of firm hugs, stroking or cuddling,” says Corti. “It can have a calming effect on children and adults. Many people affected by autism refuse physical contact with others, but might be happy with a mechanical surrogate.” Other Sensewear innovations include Biteme, a biteable silicon necklace that measures pressure, and an aromatic scarf that can emit familiar, comforting scents.“This is a visionary concept that materialises ideas initially described by Mary Temple Grandin,” says Cesare Furlanello, head of the research group at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, and an expert in the way machine learning can be applied to biomedical and environmental data. Grandin, now 70, is a US professor of animal science and campaigner for autism awareness. She specialises in the emotional as well as physical welfare of livestock, and also invented a mechanical “hug box” for humans, after noticing how confined cattle calmed down before being inoculated.“As a child, I craved to feel the comfort of being held, but I would pull away when people hugged me,” Grandin wrote in 1992 in a description of the machine, a sort of pneumatic cocoon with pressurised padding that allowed her to control her own hugging. She suffered panic attacks throughout her teenage years before building the device in early adulthood. “Gradually, my tolerance of being held by the squeeze machine grew. Knowing that I could initiate the pressure, and stop it if the stimulation became too intense, helped me to reduce the oversensitivity of my nervous system.”Medical vests that replicate this mechanism have already been developed, but Corti’s priority is to make smart clothing that looks cool. “If you have a difficulty you don’t want people to stare at you, right? You don’t want to feel different,” she says. This summer, a team including Furlanello will introduce some of the Sensewear range to children with autism, to explore its potential to make their lives easier. “Patients are very often reluctant to ‘wear’ cumbersome and ugly scientific devices,” says Furlanello, “but we expect Sensewear smart clothes will be much more acceptable, which will help researchers to collect data and expand the context of the study.”Corti now hopes that the ideas behind Sensewear’s smart clothing might one day find broader applications. “We would like to expand our philosophy to furniture, interior design and objects,” she says. “We think that everyone faces a certain degree of discomfort, so we are also thinking about people who just live in a hectic urban environment and might want protection from overwhelming sensations or stresses.”Imagine having a slow, firm hug, administered automatically and invisibly, on a delayed, crowded commuter train. There might well be a market for that.We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

This year sees the annual AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme return, with new categories including the Women Entrepreneurs in Health Tech award, created to encourage and support women pioneering some of the most innovative health technology.It’s certainly not that women aren’t enthused by the world of technology. We’ve spoken to three finalists, budding health tech entrepreneurs – who happen to also be women – to find out about their experiences within the industry.BrightSign develops communication tech for children and sign language users. Its founder, Hadeel Ayoub, travelled with a team to South Korea during her PhD studies to take part in a global hackathon, entering a smart glove that translates sign language into text or speech. They won the competition, which led her to develop the technology further and create BrightSign.“The tech arena in general is definitely male dominated. In digital health specifically, when I take part in trade shows or give a talk in a conference, most often I am the only woman on the programme. I am not necessarily treated differently, but the look of surprise on people’s faces when I am walking to the podium, into a meeting or presenting my technology cannot be overlooked. My name doesn’t always give me away as a woman, so it has happened to me several times that I am mistaken for the assistant while ‘Mr Hadeel’ is coming shortly.”Although Ayoub is encouraged by the progress the industry is making when it comes to being more inclusive to women, she sometimes feels she can be treated like a box to tick.“I feel I have been invited to events so they can even out the numbers and check the inclusivity and ersity boxes. That’s a shame, because I would rather be included for my work, not my gender.“I have to say that in the past couple of months, I have been very happy to see other female names presenting, and CEOs no less. There are a few women in tech in London. We have joined together and meet up regularly to share our challenges and support each other.”Hsin-Hua Yu, known as Sheana, was inspired by her own experiences with scoliosis (curvature of the spine) to create Aergo, a low-cost, inconspicuous postural support system. Sheana, who graduated with a double master’s in global innovation design at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London, was motivated by a research visit where she met with young people who used wheelchairs but struggled to sit comfortably and maintain a healthy posture.“Students and carers complained about the social stigma caused by not being able to sit upright, which led to people excluding them from conversations or activities. This motivated me to create a solution that helps children to break free from the need for constant assistance and build their self-confidence,” she says.Despite her complex and life-changing work, Sheana feels she faces something of an uphill struggle to be taken seriously.“As a female founder, I feel I have more to prove in front of colleagues, investors and business partners. I find the medical industry is particularly male-dominated and this can sometimes be quite intimidating. I’ve learned that by being clear, firm and professional, people begin to look past my gender and see me for my abilities.”Sheana would like to see a more “inclusive” health tech industry in future.“I’d like to see health tech designing solutions for all members of society. A lot of health tech today focuses on the medical condition and not the person. This often leads to a solution that can contribute to prejudice and social stigma. I believe in creating tech that is accessible to a wider range of users because it has the power to transform lives, remove social barriers, and change perceptions of disability within our culture.” Before creating iBreve, Wahl was working at Google’s legal department in Dublin and Boston. While travelling with her co-creator in Rishikesh, India – known as the yoga capital of the world – the pair saw an opportunity to combine breathing techniques from eastern culture with the western world and its modern stresses.“The growing trend of mindfulness and the increasing popularity of wearables reinforced our endeavour,” says Wahl. “We decided to focus initially on women’s health and wellbeing. So we designed a beautiful and discreet wearable that attaches to the bra and helps to improve stress resilience by analysing breathing patterns with machine learning.”Wahl wants to inspire more women and more ersity as a whole in the tech world.“Inspiring more girls and women to join the tech world is going to contribute to this ersity and benefits society with better answers to the current big challenges we face. My time at Google and at iBreve showed me that working together with a erse team from different backgrounds and with different experiences is productive, insightful and fun.”She would encourage women wanting to break into the health tech industry – and the tech industry as a whole – to listen to their instincts and follow what comes naturally.“The most important thing is to believe in yourself and do what you are passionate about. Trust your instincts and share your ideas and passion with others.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream.

But many now fear the city’s regeneration threatens their traditional way of lifeby Karin Goodwin and  Chris LeslieOn Water Row, sandwiched between Glasgow’s former shipyards and the dark waters of the River Clyde, it would be easy to miss the showpeople’s yards.Look closely and you’ll see a carved dancing bear, chained to an old telegraph pole, or behind high metal railings the folded-up fairground rides waiting repair – tantalising snatches of “the shows”.But now some are saying the pace of 21st-century development is pushing them out of the city.Their concerns are focused around Govan, where regeneration plans are threatening two large extended families. Glasgow city council claims that proposals for Water Row will bring new housing, jobs, businesses and leisure facilities to the community, which undoubtedly needs investment.To some, however, the proposals are hard to stomach as they will mean eviction. Teresa Johnstone was born on Water Row into the Wilmot family, a well-known family of Scottish showpeople. She married and raised her sons here, and has lived on this neat and tidy site for 29 years, paying rent and council tax. Now a £17m development is planned for the site of her home, so she will be relocated.The council says it has been “in regular dialogue with the representatives of the families, offering the full support of the council to move to alternative and fully serviced sites in the local area and beyond”. Johnstone, however, says her family only found out days before the public announcement. It took months to get anything in writing, and though a potential relocation site has now been suggested, there is still no firm solution on the table.Jimmy Stringfellow, who lives in the next yard along with his wife, Diane, their son and grandchildren, is also on tenterhooks. He is currently challenging an eviction notice he was served this year.“It feels like a game of ping pong,” he says of the communication with officials over relocation. “And I can tell you it doesn’t half pong. We’re an endangered species but there is more protection for butterflies and crocodiles than there is for us. It feels like they don’t want us. We are being shoved out of the way and into corners.”Showpeople offer an important service, she says, providing entertainment at galas, fair holidays, fetes, festivals and firework displays, and that should be recognised.“We are governed by the Showman’s Guild – we can’t just pull into derelict land, we’d get fined,” says Johnstone. “We pay council tax, we are regulated. And yet we are getting treated like second-class citizens. We should have equality.”Follow the winding River Clyde a few miles east and you’ll get to Cuningar Loop, a gated site where rows of chalets with neat front gardens house around 100 people. Yard owner Norman Thomas claims the Govan situation has left people rattled. Thomas bought this land, next to a filled-in rubbish dump, 28 years ago. He worries that he doesn’t ultimately control it – a few years ago, South Lanarkshire council tried to move these showpeople to a new site. The plan was only abandoned due to rising costs. Fresh in Thomas’ memory, too, is a relocation programme prior to the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, when 22 yards in South Dalmarnock home to some 600 people, were earmarked for redevelopment.After much consultation only 75 chalets were affected. The regeneration partnership, known as Clyde Gateway, says it is proud of the way it managed the programme to “ensure that every family or business affected would have options” for being rehoused. It developed two new yards and invested in improvements to existing sites. Next to the site, Clyde Gateway has developed a popular woodland park, and recently the British Geological Survey put in planning permission for a geo-thermal research site. Both organisations are at pains to explain how carefully they have consulted with the community, but trust isn’t won easily here.“We were brought up to be proud that we are from an entrepreneurial background that goes back for generations, and that we are all very community focused,” says Thomas’ son Royce, who returned here with his husband after studying at university in London. “But there is stigma. So when we hear about what’s happening in Govan yes, we do worry.”The community feels its entire way of life is under threat. In a wagon at the bottom of the site, Preston Irvin is painstakingly airbrushing a children’s ride. He loves this life, but says it is far from easy. There are ever-stricter licensing regulations and soaring costs fairs are shorter and competition for punters fierce. In the winter, he takes on other jobs to help him survive until the season starts again.“Years ago it was different,” he says. “I don’t want to give up this way of life but it is getting harder and harder.” He, too, fears for the future. “You’re think you’re settled. Maybe that could change. And not everyone is happy to have a fairground way of life on their doorstep.”A short drive away in Parkhead lives illustrator and researcher Mitch Miller. There are no development plans for his small, traditional site either, but Miller knows it is a precarious way of life. “What’s happening in Govan can happen anywhere.”He moved back several years ago after living in a Glasgow tenement, where he missed the community. His father, who still runs hook-a-duck stalls and other sideshows, likes to tell stories of acrobat ancestors, boxing grandmothers and trick riding aunties.Miller is one of a small group of campaigners who have written to local politicians with their concerns about the lack of due process in Govan. He hopes a solution will help others fare better in the face of future development.“We are not asking for the moon but for the procedure to be followed,” he says. “Those families have a claim to be there. They put a community in when there was nothing else.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae51b4f1cc7e62dd1d0851236cc2de72f5594b8e/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c23d39a9d62d7a0c131d39e5394695ce","title":"brexiters no deal irish border brexit","story":"At a time when Theresa May has enough problems keeping her government intact, Ireland may be regarded as an annoyance in British government circles.The border between Ireland and Northern Ireland is an inconvenience as she attempts the incredible political balancing act of reconciling her cabinet around a deal that might plausibly satisfy the remaining 27 governments of the European Union. The commitment by the British government to uphold the Belfast Good Friday agreement limits the kind of economic model the UK can pursue to just those models that are compatible with having an open land border with the EU on the island of Ireland.The Chequers proposals are useful, from an Irish perspective, in so far as they represent a unified British position on the future EU-UK relationship that allows negotiations to move forward. However, it also seems clear that this UK position will be subject to further negotiations for months to come, including during the planned transition period, and it is by no means certain the 27 governments will agree to allow access to the single market without the UK paying in or continuing to allow the free movement of workers. The resignations of Boris Johnson, David Davis and other ministers also indicates that May has stretched her cabinet as far as they will go, and it remains to be seen if their newfound unity will survive the inevitable compromises arising from the negotiations to come.Ireland’s urgent concern is to have a definitive, agreed solution for the Irish border before the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. The details of trade do not need to reach the same level of finality by that stage. And that’s where the border is an irritation, reducing as it does the scope for the UK to walk away from the trade negotiations. That would carry the sizeable political price of reneging on part of the agreement and risk worsening the already unstable politics of Northern Ireland, where the devolved assembly has been out of action for nearly a year and a half.It is tempting for some British politicians to argue that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, but it is important to recall that the Good Friday agreement was signed in April 1998 and lodged with the United Nations as a formal treaty. Twenty years of relative peace and enhanced prosperity have followed, and it must surely be understandable that people on the island of Ireland are adamant that the agreement should not be a pawn in the Brexit negotiations, not least because Northern Ireland’s population voted remain.The UK government committed on 8 December 2017 to “the avoidance of a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls”. Moreover, it also agreed to a backstop agreement, which means that in the absence of any other agreement “the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support north-south cooperation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 agreement”.This solemn commitment must be honoured, and the EU negotiators have made it abundantly clear that until there is a robust solution for the Irish border, there will be no future agreement with the UK on trade.The June summit of EU heads of government was meant to be the final presentation of the British position on the border, but the statement from Chequers came too late for that.The October council meeting is the last opportunity for the 27 EU governments to agree on a proposal on the border, which would leave just enough time for them to ratify any agreement made with the national parliaments. As with all such council meetings, it is highly desirable to have everything hammered out in advance so that heads of government simply need to sign off.In this regard, May has been handed a golden opportunity by the Austrian chancellor, who has called an exceptional summit for 20 September to discuss migration. That creates an opportunity to hold any necessary negotiations on the Irish border with the other 27 governments, so that October’s council meeting can simply sign off on it as planned and can then make greater progress on the future EU-UK trade deal.Ireland would like to see the UK remaining as close as possible to the EU for trade – or indeed holding another vote in case the British people no longer want to leave – but we won’t pay the political price of a hard border in Ireland to achieve it.• Brendan Howlin is the leader of the Irish Labour party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f0a520e5b316814abf7e1cf4a6a35cfb3b64228/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e496da1b398abed95595a6c599c6276c","title":"brexit trade eu theresa may david davis","story":"Common sense says the UK needs workable trade arrangements with the EU – but the PM still faces a battleNo sooner does Theresa May win her cabinet critics over to her Brexit compromise than David Davis rains on her parade. Her chief Brexit negotiator has had enough. His resignation letter suggests a long-disaffected colleague, sidelined from negotiations and fed up with being the butt of feuds. Quite what he wanted from his job that was remotely achievable remains obscure. Now he is yesterday’s man.Brexit steams ahead. The referendum outcome is to be honoured. Basic parliamentary sovereignty over dealings with the EU will be restored. But the modalities of Britain’s trade with its European neighbours demand workable arrangements. From the start, these have meant some sort of “friction-free” customs union and ease of movement for millions across the English Channel and the Irish border. Despite foolish pledges by May that Brexit would not mean these things, it always did mean them and it will. Few Britons ever indicated that they wanted a true “breakaway” from Europe, just from the EU. Since last week, that distinction has acquired meaning.May now has a battle on three fronts. She has her cabinet in overwhelming and explicit support, including known opponents and rivals such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. They live to fight a later day. It is hard to believe there will be any support for a leadership challenge – despite media glee at the prospect – and if there is one, May would surely win. Loyalty to the leader in a moment of crisis is now her strongest card.The next battle is to ensure support for “soft” Brexit in parliament. May can probably rely on the minority parties for her compromise, but Labour remains mealy-mouthed. Jeremy Corbyn has finally supported a customs union, but his Brexit colleague, Keir Starmer, has declared that May’s version will not work. He should be persuaded otherwise, or at the very least drawn into the final negotiating stage. Brexit must shift from being a partisan issue to being a campaign for common sense. Unity is not all, but it helps.The reason for this is May’s third battle: to strengthen her hand with the EU negotiators in Brussels, who have been left virtually to get on with it by the EU’s ided and distracted council of ministers. It is clear that “Norway plus or minus” is on the table, but it must be tweaked. Britain is not Norway. Much has to be argued at the margins of the customs union and single market.The derision shown by Brexiters towards those responsible for the British economy has been not so much arrogant as illiterate. Relations between states require the give and take of regulation and arbitration. Trade is not the end of sovereignty, but it does mean accepting the need for compromise to maintain access to Britain’s biggest and closest market. Now surely is the moment when Brexit can move on and reality dawn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/945b88697b9afa7e7b9a0599c2d5f9ff751c019a/193_0_3375_2025/master/3375.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=833ef0c4133e1c6845e5e05e2242fb86","title":"labour brexit jacob rees mogg","story":"Brexit is not really a matter of opinion. Of course, some people believe it a good idea: others, including me, think it a disaster. But as David Davis’s resignation today shows, that’s not now the point. It simply is not deliverable.The only way Brexit might have worked without an economic collapse is the Norway model of close integration with the structure of the European customs union and single market without being part of the formal EU institutions.In the end, after much anguish as she tried and failed to identify a workable “hard Brexit”, Theresa May recognised this. Hence her Chequers fudge, which was a decisive move towards Norway, with the clear intention to go further in negotiations. She tried to coax her party into a policy that kept the Brexit label but junked most of the Faragist content. At Chequers she, in effect, agreed alignment with the EU on swaths of economic regulation, accepting elements of jurisdiction by the European court of justice, crossing each and every one of her previous red lines.But it hasn’t worked. As with the poll tax in its dying months, ever more elaborate fudges and “transition” and “interim” proposals can’t bridge a chasm of this size. If she tries to move further towards Norway, she loses her party but if she doesn’t, she loses any possibility of a workable deal with the EU.May is now in the desperate position of Anthony Eden after Suez and James Callaghan in the winter of discontent. She has no policy to govern or unite the country, and her party and government are imploding. Whether it takes days, weeks or months, her government is over – and Brexit too, unless it can be reconstituted under a new prime minister or government.That now is the question facing parliament – and in particular my Labour party, which has a crucial part to play. Jeremy Corbyn needs to make it clear that he will not be a party to any Brexit. Hitherto he has declared opposition to “hard Brexit” but since there now isn’t a workable soft Brexit, the political and economic necessity is for Labour to oppose Brexit entirely.Corbyn hopes for a general election and entry into No\u0026nbsp10. Maybe the government will implode to such a degree that this happens before the key parliamentary votes on Brexit. But if this doesn’t happen quickly – and I doubt that enough Tory MPs would vote for a motion of no confidence to bring it about – then the next best course is a people’s vote.Precisely how and when a people’s vote can command a Commons majority depends upon whether May, or her Tory successor if she falls soon, is able to negotiate anything with Brussels. But since negotiations of some kind are likely to continue for a while, even if they fail, decision time will probably be at the end of the year. A people’s vote – with the choice being between staying in the EU, as against the Tory “bare bones” deal if there is one, or no deal if there isn’t – would then be in the first half of next year. Labour, with Tory pro-Europeans, would lead the campaign to stay in the EU.The original sin of Brexit – the lies, contradictions, half-truths and omissions on which it was built – have come back to haunt the Thatcherite Tories who started all this with Nigel Farage and Ukip.It is simply not possible to achieve the “freedom” from EU economic institutions that Brexiters want without undermining Britain’s economy and security. But anything short of hard Brexit leaves Britain exactly as Jacob Rees-Mogg has described it – “a vassal state”, a colony of France and Germany in key respects, because we are forced to follow their trade and regulatory systems without a seat at the table in devising them.It is not often that I agree with Rees-Mogg. But on the imperative not to become a “vassal state”, I agree entirely. The fact that we would both fiercely oppose such an outcome demonstrates that it is politically non-viable and would not command a parliamentary majority.The only way now to reassert British sovereignty and national interest is to vote to stay in the EU. We tried a different course. It hasn’t worked. It can’t be made to work. It is time to end this national farce and humiliation, and stop playing politics with people’s jobs and livelihoods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def8ca74ee1b1ce1732bbc2e6e026876606ee376/0_168_5025_3015/master/5025.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d57d2729b598abf187022a1f72c0d1f","title":"one in three fish caught never makes it to the plate un report","story":"Global fish production is at record levels thanks to fish farming, says the UN FAO, but much is wasted and many species are worryingly overfishedOne in three fish caught around the world never makes it to the plate, either being thrown back overboard or rotting before it can be eaten, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.Its biannual report on the state of the world’s fisheries, released on Monday, also shows that total fish production has reached a record high thanks to more fish farming, particularly in China, with over half the fish eaten in the world now coming from aquaculture.Fish are a crucial source of nutrition for billions of people around the globe, but overfishing is rife in some regions, with two-thirds of species overexploited in the Mediterranean and Black Seas and the Southeast Pacific. Previous analyses that include estimates for illegal fishing indicate that wild fish stocks are declining faster than FAO data suggest and that half the world’s oceans are now industrially fished. “Since 1961 the annual global growth in fish consumption has been twice as high as population growth, demonstrating that the fisheries sector is crucial in meeting the FAO’s goal of a world without hunger and malnutrition,” said José Graziano da Silva, FAO director general. Many challenges remain, he said, but recent initiatives to crack down on illegal fishing will mark “a turning point” in favour of long-term conservation.The FAO report sets out the huge scale of global fishing: it employs 60 million people and there are 4.6m fishing vessels on the planet. This huge effort is worrying in many places, the FAO says, with too many boats chasing too few fish. As a result, the number of species being overfished has trebled in the last 40 years. The report also states that climate change will drive fish away from warm tropical waters, where nations are often especially reliant on seafood, towards more temperate regions.Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of Oceana in Europe, said huge improvements were needed across the fishing industry. “Food waste on a hungry planet is outrageous,” he said. “The fact that one-third of all fish caught goes to waste is a huge cause for concern for global food security.” On overfishing, particularly in the Mediterranean, he said: “We know the situation, we have the solutions: setting fish catch limits to scientific advice and stopping illegal and destructive fishing. All we’re missing is political action.” Gustavsson added: “Aquaculture is far from being the magic bullet, as it is often unsustainable. Using 20m tonnes of fish like mackerel, sardines and anchovies to feed farmed fish instead of people is a blatant waste of food.”Prof Daniel Pauly, at the Sea Around Us research initiative at the University of British Columbia, Canada, has been very critical of previous FAO reports, which he says significantly underestimated the total catch by failing to account for illegal fishing.

But they have been immenseBy Adam White for Get French Football NewsMuch of the discussion in France this summer has been about how Didier Deschamps can squeeze all of his attacking talent into an effective unit. In his attempts to bring the best out of his forwards, the manager has drifted from a 4-4-2 to a 4-3-3 to a diamond, before arriving back at an asymmetrical 4-4-2. All the while, France’s most consistent players have not been Antoine Griezmann, Olivier Giroud or even Kylian Mbappé, but their defenders. A resolute, physical display from the back four helped the team overcome a dogged – if Edinson Cavani-less – Uruguay. France will look to Mbappé and Griezmann to score the goals that take them past Belgium and into the final, but the team’s defence is fast becoming the real star of the show.Didier Deschamps’ backline looked very different a year ago. Benjamin Mendy and Djibril Sidibé started at full-back in their three games last June – a 5-0 thrashing of Paraguay, a tough World Cup qualifier against Sweden and a 3-2 win over England where they played with 10 men for 45 minutes. Having proved crucial to Monaco in their glorious run to the Ligue 1 title, Mendy and Sidibé looked likely to take the full-back positions for France for the foreseeable future. The width, balance and crossing ability they provided was seemingly crucial to Deschamps’ plans.Deschamps’ centre-back slots seemed a little less certain. Had Laurent Koscielny not ruptured his Achilles tendon while playing for Arsenal against Atlético Madrid in May, that might still be the case. Koscielny was seen as an important player who could keep a potentially combustible squad united. He was also the only centre-back in the squad who played in all three of those matches last June. With Koscielny injured and both Mendy and Sidibé lacking fitness, Deschamps has gone with a back four of Benjamin Pavard, Samuel Umtiti, Raphaël Varane and Lucas Hernández at the World Cup. While Mendy and Sidibé are very attack-minded, their replacements are at the other end of the spectrum. As versatile and natural defenders, they have provided the team with a more compact, bullish and combative rearguard.Staying true to his schooling at Atleti under Diego Simeone, Hernández has scrapped and niggled his way through the World Cup, winning few friends but remaining undeniably effective and among France’s most consistent players. Pavard meanwhile, having looked nervous against Australia, has grown into the tournament. He is showing a defensive intelligence that blossomed as part of a Stuttgart back three during an impressive top half-finish upon their return to the Bundesliga. His wonderstrike against Argentina remains a leading contender for goal of the tournament.Umtiti has been promoted to the first XI in place of Koscielny and his physicality has made France’s defence even more imposing. They dealt with an admittedly weakened Uruguay attack comfortably on Friday. Varane in particular proved invaluable. His deft glancing header gave France the lead and his pace and intelligence helped prevent Luis Suárez from having a single shot all game. He did not even have a touch in the France box.The 2-0 win over Uruguay was France’s third clean sheet in their five games so far. The only goal they conceded in the group stage was Mile Jedinak’s penalty for Australia in the opening game and two of the three goals they conceded in the 4-3 win over Argentina were almost unpreventable – Lionel Messi’s deflected shot and Ángel Di María’s screamer.Much of the credit for Deschamps’ frugal defence must go to the midfield. N’Golo Kanté has been France’s premier performer and perhaps even the player of the tournament. His characteristically understated performances may not be showy enough to win the golden ball, but his dominance of games is respected back home. On Saturday L’Équipe sang: “Les Bleus can congratulate themselves every day for having him with them.”Kanté’s dynamism, assuredness in possession and ability to nullify attacks before they become dangerous is crucial to this team. He glues together a midfield that has evolved into a somewhat jagged, if effective, set-up where Mbappé is given far more freedom on the right flank than Blaise Matuidi or Corentin Tolisso are afforded on the left. Without Kanté, France may not have come this far.France’s attacking trident remains a little flat-footed. Mbappé’s put in an explosive display against Argentina, but maintaining such a high level over 90 minutes remains a skill the precociously talented 19-year-old is yet to master consistently. Griezmann has three goals so far – two penalties and a goalkeeping error – but he looks fatigued and is yet to light up this tournament like he did in the latter stages of Euro 2016. Similarly, Olivier Giroud is a crucial focal point for the team who creates space for his colleagues, but he is a little on the fringes and is yet to score. This may be something of an omen for France. Bernard Lacombe and Stephane Guivarc’h played similarly supporting roles and neither of them scored when France won tournaments in 1984 and 1998, respectively. Blaise Matuidi and Paul Pogba have had quietly effective tournaments, complementing Kanté with their own midfield intelligence, mobility and ability on the ball. Even Hugo Lloris has proved stronger than expected, producing perhaps the save of the tournament when he spectacularly denied Uruguay defender Martin Caceres in the quarter-final.With the World Cup already 28 teams down, France might just be the favourites from among the final four. If they are to squeeze past Belgium on Tuesday night and see off England or Croatia on Sunday, Deschamps may rely on less heralded components of his squad: his belligerent, combative, street-fighting defence. With France carefully navigating their way through the tournament so far, it might be the pragmatic ruthlessness of Hernández and Kanté rather than the flair of Mbappé and Griezmann that takes them all the way.• This is an article from Get French Football News• Follow Adam White and Get French Football News on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40246febf72365c4d21ccdffc2fc25d64009dfa5/0_266_3995_2397/master/3995.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0281bb938de265b8ee602e18bb90c2a","title":"jack wilshere west ham arsenal transfer","story":"Jack Wilshere has signed for West Ham United on a three-year contract after departing Arsenal as a free agent following 17 years at the club.The 26-year-old midfielder, who has won 34 caps for England, becomes Manuel Pellegrini’s fourth summer signing following the arrivals of Issa Diop, Lukasz Fabianski and Ryan Fredericks, another player out of contract.West Ham are also keen on the Borussia Dortmund forward Andriy Yarmolenko, with a fee of around £18m mooted for the Ukraine international who has failed to settle in the Bundesliga. Wilshere, who supported West Ham as a boy, will now fly out to Switzerland to join his new team-mates on their pre-season training camp in Bad Ragaz. His first game on home soil could be a pre-season friendly against Wycombe Wanderers on Saturday.“It feels good and of course my family and a few of my friends are West Ham fans so everyone’s buzzing,” Wilshere, whose brother and father are also supporters of his new club, said. “People will have seen the picture of me in a West Ham shirt and I’ve got good memories of my childhood supporting West Ham, watching them at Upton Park.”West Ham’s newly-appointed director of football, Mario Husillos, the former Málaga sporting director, added: “Manuel and I identified him as a target as soon as we joined the club and we are delighted to have succeeded in securing Jack’s signature above a number of other teams.

He rose through the ranks to make his first-team debut against Blackburn Rovers in September 2008 when he was 16. Since then, he has featured for England at the 2014 World Cup and Euro 2016 and also spent a season on loan at Bournemouth in 2016-17 to build fitness away after a long-term struggle with injuries.Wilshere made 197 appearances for Arsenal, 38 of which came last season – his best total since 2013-14 – and said it was always his intention, until contractual discussions with Emery, to remain an Arsenal player."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e3d85a542e8a333337912942ebd1485038cd9f/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=968a469b42bd201ce4aaf98e965dc399","title":"transfer window deals missed world cup europe big leagues","story":"While events in Russia have hogged the headlines, the market has rolled along.

But, you know, in the middle of it all, they just want to pay football. It’s a very pure, special thing. They really rise above it with their magical, spellbinding corners. They remind you why it’s called the beautifully planned game. Yup, come on England! We’re all, English now.” All that in Portuguese, obviously.Furthermore, I trust England are now the subject of a welter of patronising articles across the foreign press, explaining how the hopes of a once-proud nation have been dashed by lying populistscorrupt bribersEtonian warlords, and are now telescoped entirely on to this plucky squad. (Before we go much further, I must apologise to all the other home nations for this analogy – at the same time as offering the caveat that it is, after all, just an analogy. We’re at the business end of a World Cup with no football for 36 hours: be prepared to suck up a lot of tenuous analogies)Anyway, how do these foreign editorials run? “All eyes are on rebel strongman Boris Johnson,” a leader in the Nigeria Tribune might put it, “once beloved in his tribal lands but whose reputation has oxidised as rapidly as one of the vanity projects to which he siphoned vast sums of public money.”“As allegations of democratic corruption swirl,” a foreign correspondent for one of the Mexico City papers could have it, “the slum bars of this humbled nation throb with a pride against the odds. ‘It’s coming home’, runs the local chant, that can be heard from shanty to chic apartment in this otherwise ided country. What kind of home it could return to is, alas, another matter …” And so on for another four thousand words.Throwing this particular cultural moment into even sharper relief is the UK’s longtime refusal to realise it had become one of the true basket cases of international life – something that can surely no longer be ignored. Yet even a couple of weeks ago it still felt like something that happened to other countries. “For many years,” the former Argentina forward Jorge Valdano reflected of his homeland in a wonderful article for the , “football made up for our long political, social and economic decline.”Incredible, when you think about it, that England are close to being the sort of thing that might be routinely said about them. England! Until literally four minutes before this World Cup, there was a corner of so many foreign fields that was forever a toxic England exit. Charleroi, Shizuoka, Lisbon, Gelsenkirchen, Bloemfontein, São Paolo. The fact we’d gone out of Euro 2016 to Iceland a mere four days after going out of Europe to Brexit was frequently characterised as somehow symbiotic by people such as me. People with deadlines, particularly. Everything was a metaphor for everything else. Indeed, two weeks ago Valdano had begun by rueing the fact you could now say the same about Argentina the football side as you could about Argentina the country: “So many things are wrong with Argentina we do not know what is wrong so much is happening no one knows what is happening.”Same. Except, no – wait! Hilariously and extraordinarily, the football is going OK. It’s going more than OK. It’s going so marvellously OK that whatever happens on Wednesday at the Luzhniki, Gareth Southgate’s England have done enough to be vastly attractive to all sorts of public figures who wish to co-opt their spiritual rebirth.All of which necessitates a popular decree: following the shithousery of the past 24 hours, no Conservatives, at all, are now allowed to attempt to piggyback on the success (or indeed the plucky failure) of the England football side. They are formally banned from even mentioning it. Tories: you all need to realise that this latest self-own is of a wildly different order to Theresa May being tricked into holding up the Hazard Belgium shirt during her visit to Brussels the other week. Sorry to nick your catchphrase, but let US be clear: if you guys collapse the government in the week England could reach its first World Cup final since 1966 – having already diary-clashed Donald Trump’s visit into that same week – you will carry a mark of Cain that will make all of your other marks of Cain look like henna tattoos.I mean, honestly. Shame on the politicians looking at this sweltering hot, heady summer of football and thinking: “Ooh, this would totally be enhanced by a general election”. Really? Really? Let us be very clear: stay away from Gareth and stay out of our fun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/337248c52e901c1ff11041c69365cbadff370bc0/71_153_1794_1076/master/1794.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=501858b9a20dfed472b12e353afad1c8","title":"italia 90 england world cup semi final football","story":"The dustbins! I went outside with the dustbin, and that was the moment I realised that my country had changed. For ever, as it turned out.It was Sunday 1 July 1990, England’s quarter-final against Cameroon in Naples. I watched at home and at half-time remembered that Monday was dustbin day. I lugged mine on to my north London rat-run street. And there was silence.Just about everyone was indoors watching the game. Obviously, the same will happen this Wednesday. But then it was far from obvious. It may be hard for those who believe sporting history began in 1992 (“In the beginning God created the Premier League ... and he saw that it was good because everyone would make oodles of dosh”) to imagine the state of English football in the 1980s.There were the three great disasters: the Bradford fire, Heysel and Hillsborough. But in any case football was in disgrace due to hooliganism. Sensible people avoided the game. It was never quite challenged as the No\u0026nbsp1 sport but its position was wobbly. Cricket was far more likely to create headlines that did not involve fatalities: the nation’s most charismatic and newsworthy sportsman of the 80s was Ian Botham. Sports such as American football and, in some cities, ice hockey, had started to generate remarkable interest.Furthermore, sport as a whole was not the all-embracing preoccupation it was to become. It was impossible to imagine a major government crisis struggling for public attention because of a mere game. And never before had sport made London sit so still.I was covering the 1990 World Cup for the , but not obsessively. I had always hated being abroad in summer, partly because of that now-forgotten tradition, “the cricket season”. And that summer I was wildly in love and about to get married. So it was agreed I could commute.My itinerary began with England in Sardinia, where the aggro overwhelmed the indifferent football. I came back to give Frank Keating a break from Wimbledon, (where the main event was 14-year-old Jennifer Capriati) and was due back in Italy for the semi-finals. Hence the importance of the dustbins, made all the more urgent because England came from behind to win 3-2, whereupon the silence turned to celebration.The manager, Bobby Robson, was under pressure even before the tournament and forced to announce that he would resign afterwards. All along, the football writers hurled abuse at him – sometimes with a viciousness now found only in presidential tweets – for his strategy, or lack of it. And their mood was not improved by the general quality of the entertainment.The 3-2 scoreline was unique at that World Cup, which is still recognised as the most turgid of all time: defences ruled, and not prettily: throughout there was an average of just over two goals a game, despite several thrashings suffered by no-hopers early on.Three days after that, I arrived in the media centre in Turin for the semi-final to find my colleagues sunk in gloom. They greeted a traveller from home like shipwrecked mariners. It had all been so boring, they moaned. I almost had to shake some of them: “Don’t you understand what’s going on in England? The country’s gone crazy.” They shook their heads in bewilderment. Modern telecoms were still in their infancy. At that very moment commuters were hurtling for home with all the zeal we can expect this Wednesday.That night England lost to the Germans, heroically, via the new and still controversial expedient of penalties. Next morning Robson gave a press conference suffused with such mellowness, forgiveness and class that it paved the way for his ultimate knighthood and near-canonisation. A new life was about to begin, for him and for English football.But this was not just the World Cup when England rediscovered football. It was when much of the planet found it for the first time. One technology was then approaching its peak: even since the 1986 World Cup TV had spread across the globe, into rural Africa, where squeals of delight were ubiquitous when the continent’s standard-bearers Cameroon took the lead, and Asia: there were riots in Calcutta after a power cut at a crucial moment.There was also a riot in Northampton, after England lost, when 500 youths rampaged through the town centre. It had all been more vivid on TV than it was in Turin. The abiding image of the night, that of Gazza’s tears (not in defeat but when he was booked, thus forcing him to miss the notional final), was not visible in the stadium.And thus the new order began. Then came the Premier League. This did nothing to end England’s failures in major international tournaments. If anything, it exacerbated them by reducing homegrown players to bit parts and making the best of them rich enough to be blasé about summertime distractions. It has taken this hitherto obscure group of youngsters to change that mindset.There will be tears again if England lose on Wednesday. But they are more likely off the field than on, among the millions back home who, at the moment of the nation’s greatest existential crisis since 1940, really are daft enough to think football matters more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/238bfd9dae73c07fa1b75b9d6c15854681274ee5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10dc1bdf5571b857d340761a17a39a1e","title":"martinez southgate belgium england world cup semi finals","story":"Roberto Martínez still lives on the outskirts of Wigan, his dormitory village on the edge of the Lancashire plain proving as convenient a base for managing Belgium as it was for his previous jobs at Wigan Athletic and Everton.It is already becoming easy to forget that the man who sent Brazil home early from Russia was practically run out of town while in his last Premier League post certainly by the end of the 2015-16 season there were not too many Everton supporters sorry to see him go. It is quite a neat trick using a World Cup to reinvent yourself without actually changing very much, though that is exactly what Gareth Southgate has also managed to do with England.Should Belgium and England end up facing each other on Sunday, an almost laughable prospect when the tournament started but a very real possibility now, the similarities between the managers will be difficult to ignore. Both were in charge of teams relegated from the Premier League for a start, which whatever his other faults was not a charge that could be levelled at Sam Allardyce.Martínez will always have that rather splendid FA Cup final win of 2013 with Wigan on his CV, though he and Southgate seemed to have their managerial limitations exposed when tasked with taking Everton and Middlesbrough forward. Southgate claims his best work was done at Boro, Martínez can look back at one encouraging season after promising to take Everton into the Champions League, but the inescapable reality is that no Premier League club was beating a path to either manager’s door once they became available.Both in slightly different ways were considered too open and naive for the sharp-elbowed Premier League. Martínez because he placed too much emphasis on possession and paid too little attention to defence, Southgate because no one could imagine him raising his voice in the dressing room or resorting to scrapping tactics when the need arose.Those perceptions have changed now the pair have reached the World Cup semi-finals, yet the managers in question have stayed the same. Southgate is being lauded for the very politeness and honesty that seemed to undermine him at club level – people are even saying his guileless decent-bloke persona would make a refreshing change to the political landscape – while Martínez has found himself in charge of some of the best attacking players on the planet.A suspicion of defensive frailty remains – not too many teams in the knockout stage would have found themselves having to come back from two goals down against Japan – though Martínez does not appear too worried about it. What do you do when you are blessed with attacking players of the quality of Eden Hazard, Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku? Appoint Thierry Henry as your assistant of course.So have Bob and Gary just got lucky, or does international football suit some managers in a way club football does not? A bit of both is the probable answer. Anyone in the world would consider themselves lucky to be in charge of the present England and Belgium squads.Southgate might have been promoted by default but he found it easy to make a natural break with the past and let some emerging young talent come through. Belgium have had a winning team on paper for some years and Martínez was by no means an obvious candidate for the opportunity to release that potential on the pitch but even those who still choose to regard him as a smooth-talking chancer will have to admit that putting out Brazil represents significant improvement.It may well be the case also that tournament football, because it is intense and short term, suits some managers better than the season-long slog at club level. At national level a manager does not have the responsibility of sourcing players or spending the club’s money either, and anyone familiar with Martínez’s wildly inconsistent forays into the transfer market will understand that is sometimes a relief.Yet though it might be true Southgate and Martínez are managing to make the most of promising situations, like Chris Coleman harnessing team spirit and riding a wave of national fervour with Wales at Euro 2016, it should not be assumed their success shows anyone can do it.Southgate in particular has changed the way England play. It was his preference to select Harry Maguire, play with a back three and move Kyle Walker in from full-back, and all three bold decisions have been vindicated. Jesse Lingard might not even have made some managers’ squads, yet Southgate has turned him into a key member of the team. Southgate stood behind Jordan Pickford when the goalkeeper drew some criticism in the group stage and it is fair to say that call also went well.Martínez managed to think on his feet when Belgium went behind against Japan, something he did not always seem capable of doing at club level, and effectively turned the game with the introduction of Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli. That reconstructed midfield remained in place for the Brazil game, where Martínez also deserved credit for devising a shape to bring the best out of his three most potent attackers. He played Lukaku and Hazard up front but not central, with De Bruyne allowed to come through the middle as the forward tip of a midfield diamond. Lukaku’s strength and De Bruyne’s deadly finishing were both seen to good effect in Belgium’s second goal against Brazil, as classically executed a counterattack as you will see at this tournament.How the story ends remains to be seen, though it will end, in just less than a week. By that time either Bob or Gary could be striding the world like a colossus, installed as national manager on a more or less permanent basis like Joachim Löw, or they could be tormenting themselves by recalling what happened to Coleman after Wales, when he was obliged to try to prove himself all over again at Sunderland.Right now, however, club football and relegation concerns must seem a world away. Reaching a World Cup semi-final is already an outstanding achievement but there could be so much more to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee4688592daf336d7ae3726cdef3f7371f8f767e/0_255_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f6fb625cf7e17a1a43b88142c259e86","title":"raheem sterling england world cup","story":"In the minds of those who watched them win the 1970 World Cup, Mário Zagallo’s Brazil still represents the fulfilment of all the seldom-kept promises of international football. The mere mention of their star players – Pelé, Jairzinho, Roberto Rivelino, Carlos Alberto – conjures images of suave magic under the Mexican sun. But there was one player, a little less celebrated, without whom their triumph would have been much harder to achieve.Eduardo Gonçalves de Andrade, known as Tostão, was a 23-year-old centre-forward who had appeared fleetingly in Brazil’s 1966 campaign in England while still a teenager. Four years later he arrived with Zagallo’s squad having just recovered from a serious operation on a detached retina.Some observers were beguiled by the way he looked so little like a Brazilian footballer, or indeed any sort of professional footballer at all. Pale in complexion, his hair already receding, he stood no more than 5ft 7in and better resembled the doctor he would eventually become. His physical slightness turned out to be deceptive – he was as tough as he needed to be – and his play was fundamental to the collective freedom with which the team attacked their opponents. Functioning as a false 9, he floated around the more charismatic presence of Pelé, finding space and linking play with uncanny perception.He scored only two of Brazil’s 19 goals in their six matches, both of them in the 4-2 win over Peru in the quarter-finals, which might not seem much of a return for a centre-forward. But his assists came in profusion, never more spectacularly than in the group match against England, when he lost possession on the edge of the opposition’s penalty area, chased to regain it, exchanged passes with Paulo César, fended off Alan Ball, nutmegged Bobby Moore, hustled past Tommy Wright and then, counter-intuitively, turned back away from goal in order to spoon an exquisite ball to Pelé, who transfixed Brian Labone and drew Terry Cooper before sliding the ball sideways for the incoming Jairzinho to shoot home and decide the match.It was Tostão’s deftness and vision that came to mind when a 5ft 7in forward swivelled on Jesse Lingard’s pass just outside the Panama area a fortnight ago and flicked a return at the most cunning of angles, inviting his teammate to score the third and most beautiful of England’s six goals. Raheem Sterling’s touch was instant and intuitive, his decision-making ego-free. It was exactly what Gareth Southgate had hoped for when he chose the Manchester City man as the key to unpicking defences.Tostão’s importance to Brazil turned out to have nothing to do with his goalscoring ability, and neither does Sterling’s role in the England team. It would certainly be useful if the man who scored 23 goals for Manchester City last season could end an international drought stretching back to October 2015 – the emphasis placed on that barren spell clearly weighs on his mind whenever a chance to score presents itself – but there is a more important job to be done.Southgate may well be the first England manager since Sir Alf Ramsey to decide on a system and then choose his players to fit the pattern. Others have struggled with fitting prominent figures into the starting lineup and allowed their presence to determine the tactical approach.His modest coaching background has allowed him to develop his theory of the game away from the most intense public scrutiny. His early failure at Middlesbrough was followed by a period as the FA’s head\u0026nbspof coaching and then as the manager of England Under-21s, where he could formulate his ideas and work on them with players amenable to tactical guidance.He soon settled on his basic requirements. He needed a goalkeeper with accurate distribution. He looked for a back three capable of playing the ball between each other with confidence, sucking their opponents towards them before releasing the midfield, and willing to do that over and over again with great patience. He required wing-backs prepared to hold their stations, stretching the play laterally. He wanted responsibility in midfield and diligence and flexibility in the forward roles, including one player whose pace and nose for an opportunity would stretch the play vertically and keep the opposition on the back foot.To achieve this he needed to be rigorous in his selection policy. Those who fitted the template were preferred over those with bigger reputations who had different skills or might feel they had earned the right to\u0026nbspexpress themselves by straying from\u0026nbspthe prescribed pattern. And when he had the right player, he was prepared to defend him.Southgate took big risks on Kyle Walker (out of position), John Stones (out of form) and Harry Maguire (low on experience) because he believed in their ability to do exactly what he wanted. The same is true of Sterling, who may not be a Tostão in terms of footballing refinement but whose personal repertoire of finding positions at speed, of occupying defenders and of smuggling the ball to a teammate makes him a vital cog in the machine, even when not everything into which he puts his unflagging energy comes off as he would wish.The players can see for themselves Southgate’s approach is working, which helps to explain the healthy absence of moans leaked via the agents of those omitted from the starting lineup. Like Clive Woodward in 2005, the manager has convinced every member of the squad by word and deed that they have an important part to play. He has no time to waste changing the minds of those back home who fail to see the point of Raheem Sterling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56a47c78c240a2c127ef1acc385a4ab2c6db762d/561_0_4279_2568/master/4279.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=637f5e1e31d356d9eb6847391dfb23b1","title":"world cup 2018 buildup to the semi finals begins live","story":"In another intense day of World Cup pre-excitement, a variety of events took place, including some training and a bear doing a thingAnd with that, I’m out of here.

Oh, and here’s a quiz!Here’s Reuters on that Hugo Lloris press conference. Fireworks it ain’t.Captain Hugo Lloris feels France are ready for the challenge of taking on a Belgium outfit who “know how to do everything” in Tuesday’s World Cup semi-final.Lloris said at a pre-match press conference: “They are an exhaustive team, they know how to do everything. I think the Belgian team is the most exhaustive team in all aspects of the game during this tournament - they are strong everywhere. They have everything they need to be a great team and and they are a great team. “It is a fantastic generation and in order to beat them we will have to play a great match. “We know there are going to be difficult moments, and we’ll have to be ready to suffer. But we will be ready because we have an extremely good state of mind, and it is the semi-finals in the World Cup. It is an opportunity in our careers and we have to grab it with both hands.” Let’s get quizzical:“In the 2006 final, Cannavaro and Zidane were captains,” writes Olivier. “Both were Real Madrid players at the date of the final, although Cannavaro had just joined 9 days before from Juventus, and Zidane retired the next day.” Not so, though: Zidane had announced his retirement in April 2006, and official retired as the final whitle sounded. That was on 9 July 2006, and Real announced the arrival of Cannavaro on 19 July. Close, but it doesn’t count.Nothing springs to mind, but having said that I have been liveblogging a rest day at the World Cup for most of the last seven and a half hours, so my mind is a little addled.Domagoj Vida, the Croatia defender, appears to have got away with the “glory to Ukraine” video that was posted online after his team’s victory over Russia in the quarter-finals. His partner in crime, Ognjen Vukojevic, has not been so lucky. This from the Press Association:Croatia’s Football Federation (HNS) sacked Ognjen Vukojevic, a member of the national team’s coaching staff, over a “glory to Ukraine” video posted after Croatia beat Russia in the World Cup quarter-finals, HNS said in a statement on Monday.Vukojevic and Croatia defender Domagoj Vida published the video on social media after the match on Saturday, which was criticised by Russian politicians and led to a warning from FIFA’s disciplinary committee. Relations between Ukraine and World Cup hosts Russia remain fraught after the latter’s 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula and its backing for a pro-Russian uprising in the east of the country. HNS said it has revoked Vukojevic’s team accreditation at the World Cup and relieved him of his duties as an observer for the Croatia squad. “HNS hereby apologises to the Russian public for the actions of a member of the Croatian delegation,” it said. It said that Vukojevic and Vida also apologised for their statements, saying they were not intended to be political messages but “unfortunately left room for such interpretations”. Both Vukojevic and the 29-year-old Vida previously played for Ukrainian club Dynamo Kiev. Deschamps is asked for his thoughts about Russia’s team. He’s not impressed:Are you sure you asked me that question? Do I really have to talk about Russia? I don’t really see the point. Let’s move on.He’s asked about Belgium’s tactical tweaking against Brazil, and whether he’s expecting more surprises tomorrow:My team will be ready for different scenarios, different formations. This Belgium team didn’t get here by chance, they played a great game against Brazil with a very specific gameplan. Will they do something similar against us? Well, probably.When they get the ball, this Belgium team is really able to perform. They attack very well and very fast. I have made sure my players are prepared for any scenario, with different formations at the beginning of the match or during the match if it changes.Didier Deschamps is talking now, about facing a team he knows very well:We know them, they know us. The peculiarity is that there are many players on my team who have club team-mates facing them. It’s an advantage to both teams. During the match everyone will be on their own side, and we will do everything to seize any opportunity to reach the final of the World Cup.Hugo Lloris has just eulogised Raphael Varane, “a great player and a great person”. Which brings us to this:In occasional England international news, Jack Wilshere has signed for West Ham, agreeing a three-year contract.Here’s Hugo Lloris on Thierry Henry, Belgium coach:I played with him for two seasons in the French team, and he was a great player. It is true it is a little peculiar to see him with the Belgium team, but that is his career and that’s how he’s building his future. I think his heart will be split tomorrow, because before everything he is French. He has lived through great moments in the blue jersey. He scored the most goals, is second in terms of number of caps. We know him, he has a lot of passion for football and he will be with the Belgians and will give everything to help his team.Lloris is asked about Belgium’s team:There will be a lot of great players on the pitch tomorrow. So it is bound to be a great match, a high-level match, and we will have to raise our level again to keep up the standards we set in the Round of 16 and the quarter-finals.The France press conference has begun, with Hugo Lloris being asked about the stadium in St Petersburg.It’s a magnificent stadium. We have a good memory of our match here in March when we played Russia. I think it’s a magnificent stadium for a fantastic match, like the World Cup semi-final. And it’s with great honour and pride that we will represent our country at this event.The Uruguay team have just arrived in Montevideo following their elimination from the World Cup in the quarter-finals.Birthday boy Ashley Young has been speaking to the press today. I’m sure a full report will be over shortly, but from the snippets sneaking through on the wires it seems he’s been going big on negatives:We have put ourselves in a great position to go on and win it. I said before the start of the tournament, ‘We’re not going out there not to win the World Cup.’Croatia are a very good team. They are not in the semi-final for no reason. We have got to be prepared for them.Right, Simon is fed and refreshed and ready to go again. But I’ll leave you with something that I missed in the BBC’s coverage of the England match on Saturday. As a fan of The National’s earlier work, I very much enjoyed this. Bye.Richard Williams is a firm believer that great World Cup sides of the past have been built around ego-free forwards – and in Raheem Sterling, England have got a cunning attacker who is utterly irreplaceable.If the World Cup has taken over your life like an algorithm at a social media behemoth, then you may have missed some transfer news.

So, either way, pretty soon.On the subject of World Cup managers who haven’t had club careers comparable to that of Luis Enrique’s, Paul Wilson has written a lovely feature on Roberto Martínez and Gareth Southgate, who have proved more at home amid the intensity of a short World Cup campaign than a Premier League slog. And did you know that Martínez still lives on the outskirts of Wigan? I didn’t. Well, not until I read this piece any way.Hello, Gregg here. Right, back to the news that Luis Enrique has taken the Spain job. The president of the Spanish Football Federation, Luis Rubiales, has said that their new coach turned down better paid roles to take on the challenge of reinvigorating the national team. At first glance, it seems somewhat of a coup but then this World Cup has shown that managers who haven’t had stellar club careers can do just as well as those who have.Right, I’m going to pop away for a bit of luncheon. Gregg Bakowski will fill in. I leave you with an email: “Has anyone else noticed the parallels between Gareth’s boys and the all conquering England Rugby team of 2003?” wonders Duncan Watanabe. “Both teams, while perhaps not as pleasing to the eye as other sides, arewere extremely well-prepared, well-organised and well-drilled with new set play ideas and a well mannered hero who you can always depend on to slam home the penalties!”The BBC are showing the 1990 World Cup semi-final between England and West Germany in full online at the moment (if you’re in the UK you can watch it here). The most striking thing about what I’ve seen of it so far (the second half has just got under way) is the prevalence of the back-pass as an easy way of getting out of defensive difficulties.News just in: this sad-looking bear thinks Belgium are going to beat France, based on it doing something it didn’t understand.Official: Luis Enrique is the new coach of Spain:This, meanwhile, was the half-time entertainment at Xolos Tijuana in Mexico on Saturday, midway through a friendly against the Costa Rican side Herediano. It’s a “Neymar Challenge”, in which participants compete to see who can roll along the ground the greatest distance while screaming in pain (courtesy of FourFourTwo).It’s all happening in Spain, where a new head coach is expected to be announced this afternoon. This from Reuters:The Spanish Football Federation has appointed Jose Francisco Molina as Spain’s new sporting director but it has delayed naming a new national team coach until after it holds a board meeting later on Monday. The new head coach of Spain’s national team needed to be a person of strong character, President of Spain’s Football Federation Luis Rubiales said during a press conference. “What we are looking for is an undeniable leader in the dressing room, who sets a pattern and that no one deviates from that pattern, and that is the selection of the future we have devised,” Rubiales said, adding that an official announcement would be made this afternoon. Local media reported earlier on Monday that former Barcelona coach Luis Enrique will be the next national team coach. It must feel absolutely bizarre to be Gareth Southgate at the moment.England have held a behind-closed-doors training session, and are declaring that everybody is fit and well, though as we’ve discovered there is always the possibility that this is just disinformation, and in fact England’s last two fit players went to the cinema.This just in from the Corrigan Brothers, the people behind the Irish No24 hit, There’s No One as Irish as Barack Obama:The Irish band the Corrigan Brothers from Limerick are celebrating a fellow Limierck Man in song.

He is not the best striker that Limerick has ever produced, he is second to Des Kennedy, our Limerick Legend, the man who couldn’t stop scoring against Real Madrid in our great European Cup Campaign in 1980.’ The Corrigan Brothers look forward to performing the song for Harry when he brings the Golden Boot home to Limerick. “While I don’t think that Mark Geiger of USA was baised, his performance in England vs Colombia wasn’t very assured,” writes Mike MacKenzie in Canada. “I’m surprised that he wasn’t sent home, especially with 12 refs still on hand.” I have to agree with this. I’d still be extremely surprised to see him back on the pitch in this tournament.So there are still 12 referees, and only four games left for them to officiate. The only referee to have taken charge of a knock-out game who has subsequently been sent home is Damir Skomina, whose officiating of Sweden 1-0 Switzerland obviously displeased somebody.Fifa have taken the pruning sheers to their referees’ list, and these are the officials that are still on it:And here’s Luka Modric on England, in which he refuses to tell us an interesting story about Harry Kane. “Harry was young and just coming up,” Modric said about his time at Tottenham. “He was always a hard worker. I actually remember one story about him but I will keep it to myself.”Here’s a piece on Jordan Henderson:Jordan Henderson limped away from the Samara Arena on Saturday evening offering up a few optimistic soundbites as he went. “It doesn’t feel too bad,” was swiftly followed up with “hopefully it’ll be fine”. But it says everything about the impact the Liverpool midfielder has made in Russia that the admission he had overstretched an already tight hamstring late on in the victory against Sweden instantly spread a sense of dread among his audience. Henderson, a figure who has rather ided opinion over the years, is established as this team’s heartbeat. Colombia’s team doctor has admitted he lied about James Rodriguez’s injury, and says such misinformation is “part of the game”. I report this without judgement: I think he’s right, and in a similar position would say pretty much anything that seemed useful:On the subject of Russian cuisine, here’s a mouthwatering picture of Barney Ronay’s breakfast buffet yesterday:In the absence of actual football to report on, Reuters have sent over a piece about Russian food:Many soccer fans knew little or nothing about Russian cuisine before the World Cup, but have tucked into local gastronomy with relish, trying everything from luxurious caviar to staples like veal tongue.Russian food is often thought of as bland and heavy, and indeed many dishes seem geared towards getting people through the gruelling winter rather than amusing their palates. But 28 year-old Egyptian Ahmed Morsy has made it a point of trying a new Russian dish every day. Meat-filled pelmeni dumplings and Beef stroganoff rank among his favourites. “I love it, honestly. It’s better than I expected. I don’t like spicy food myself so for me it was perfect,” said Morsy as he perused a restaurant menu in the sweltering southern city of Volgograd. “The whole country has exceeded my expectations. I had never been to Russia before, I thought the people would be grumpy and the country not that organised,” he said. Indeed, most fans have been impressed by Russians - some in remote or industrial towns where tourists rarely tread - bending over backwards to help, dispelling preconceptions and spreading an upbeat atmosphere. “I thought Russian food might be weird. I haven’t found it weird. But I do prefer the Uzbek and Azerbaijani barbecue,” said Morsy’s university pal Mamdooh El Eleila, 29, who ordered Kiev chicken, a fillet that is either fried or baked. Indeed, food from nearby countries - particularly spicier Georgian cuisine - has been particularly popular with fans looking for a little more piquancy in their plates. Caviar bars and vodka cocktails have also been prized. Still, some fans from countries like India and Mexico, renowned for their succulent spicy fare, have not been impressed. “The flavours here are quite salty. And of course we miss chili,” said Ricardo Garcia, a 32 year-old programmer decked out in the green Mexican football jersey. “We brought hot sauce with us from Mexico but we forgot it in our last hostel and now were suffering a little. We found some ketchup with chili in a supermarket and that helps a little, but it’s not the same.” His pal Heriberto Gonzalez, however, was far more upbeat. “There are some soups that any Mexican mothers could prepare! Borscht, for example, because they use the potato in a very similar way. Of course, there’s a little bitter Russian flavour to it,” said Gonzalez, a 37 year-old who works in marketing. “But if I wanted Mexican food, I would have stayed in Mexico!” Some fans, however, have found temporary refuge in their own cuisine - like Egyptian physics student Ahmed Nasr, who was queuing for a shawarma. But he said local waiters and chefs had also prodded him - via Google Translate - to try local fares including Russian lamb and buckwheat. “I was at a buffet and the staff encouraged me to try Russian food. I liked it. I did not even know what they ate in Russia,” said Nasr, 31, who lives in Canada. “In Canada we have Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern food, but I’ve never seen Russian. Maybe I will look for a Russian restaurant - hopefully I can find one!” he laughed.“Getting exciting, isn’t it!” writes Will Hargreaves. Well, I’d say it was exciting from the beginning, but has now become tense and nervous and a little bit surreal. “That acknowledged, I don’t think that Snr Martinez has actually wet himself. I think that striding across the middle of the sprinkler avoids this occurrence. Another piece of tactical genius from the Belgium leader.”Well, perhaps. I thought perhaps he’d misjudged it, as one of two streams of water coming out of the sprinkler appeared to end in his groinal area. Here, though, is something else that the Belgians have been working on in training: ball-levitation:This article in the New York Times about the bizarre circus that is the World Cup press conference is very good.There will be no ban, so long as he doesn’t repeat the offence: Fifa yesterday said their disciplinary committee had “sent a warning to the player Domagoj Vida due to his video statement following the 2018 Fifa World Cup match between Russia and Croatia”, which is as far as they are going to go for now.Belgium have been training already today, a session in which Roberto Martinez appears to have quite deliberately wet himself.There’s not a lot of official World Cup activity scheduled today, but this is what I’ve got (all times BST):1.30pm England “media opportunity”. I don’t know if this is a full-blown press conference or simply a game of darts.2.45pm France will hold a press conference in St Petersburg, featuring Didier Deschamps and Hugo Lloris.4pm Croatia hold a press conference in Moscow.5pm Belgium hold a press conference in St Petersburg, with Roberto Martinez and Kevin de Bruyne involved.Andy Perkins has come up with perhaps the definitive response to Naaman’s earlier call for a proposed list of England penalty takers: “My five penalty takers for England. Kane, RashfordVardy, Trippier, Young, Maguire with his head.” England’s official twitter account has recycled some old photos to mark Ashley Young’s birthday.

It’s the moment to reach over your run-of-the-mill green courgette for the likes of scallop-edged patty pans, which I’ve been roasting whole with a hint of sweet and a hit of sour. The small, sweet courgettes I’ve sliced paper-thin and dressed with mint, basil, lemon, oil, salt and nothing more – and then I’ve turned any lingering in the fridge into these fritters: courgettes, halloumi and a quick chilli jam to perk up the plate.I use both rice flour and plain flour here, which I think together are key to the crispness of these fritters. If using two flours is a step too far, then plain, spelt or rice by themselves would work fine. If you are vegan, you can replace the halloumi with two more courgettes.3 medium courgettes (about 400g)1 packet halloumi (about 225g) 100g rice flour 100g plain or white spelt flour1 tsp baking powder1 pinch dried oreganoZest and juice of 1 lemonOlive oilSalad leaves, to serveFor the chilli jam6 red chillies, finely sliced6 tbsp red-wine vinegar5 tbsp sugar1 small bunch mint, leaves picked and finely choppedPut all the chilli jam ingredients into a small pan and bring to a simmer for five to eight minutes, until the liquid has thickened and the chillies are soft and sticky.Grate the courgette and halloumi.

As part of the study the team also looked the impact on other measures, including growth and sleep. “An added benefit (of early introduction of solids) is that it seems to confer better sleep for the children,” said Gideon Lack, professor of paediatric allergy at King’s College London, and a co-author of the research.Writing in the journal Jama Pediatrics, Lack and a team of researchers behind the study say while there is a common belief that eating solid food helps a baby to sleep better – with one NHS survey suggesting most mothers give their child food before five months – many sources of advice for new parents, including the NHS and the National Childbirth Trust, recommend that parents should wait until six months before introducing solids. “We believe the most likely explanation for our findings of improved sleep is that that these babies are less hungry” said Lack, adding that solid foods might mean less regurgitation or greater feelings of being full.More than 1300 healthy breastfed three-month-olds were split randomly into two groups in one the babies were exclusively breastfed until they were six months old – as current guidelines recommend – while children in the other group were breastfed and given solid foods, including peanuts, eggs and wheat, from the age of three months, in addition to breastfeeding. After six months babies in both groups were eating a range of solids.The children’s health and behaviour was followed for three years, with their sleep and consumption of solid food tracked by families through questionnaires. While not all babies were kept to their allotted regime, on average, babies who were in the breastfeeding only group were first introduced to solids at around 23 weeks, while those in the other group encountered the foods at around 16 weeks The team found that the more closely parents stuck to the early introduction programme, the stronger the effect. Lack said a crucial finding is that parents who were asked to exclusively breastfeed had almost twice the odds of reporting a serious problem with their child’s sleep than those who were asked to introduce their babies to solid food early.The team did note that the study did not use sensors to monitor infants’ sleep and that parents might have misreported sleeping behaviour because they had previously encountered the idea that babies fed solid foods earlier sleep better.However Professor Amy Brown of Swansea University, whose research includes weaning of babies, said the benefits revealed by the study were “minimal” in real-world terms, and that other research showed no rewards for early introduction of solids.“There is no clear physiological reason why introducing solids foods early would help a baby sleep, especially not for the very small amounts parents were instructed to give in this trial,” she said.Brown urged caution, noting that no difference in waking was seen until after five months, despite one group being introduced to solids from three months, and that self-report of infant sleep by tired parents was unlikely to be precise. Prof Mary Fewtrell, nutrition lead for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health welcomed the study, noting the RCPCH currently recommends solid foods are not introduced before four months, but that the evidence base for current advise is more than 10 years old and is currently under review in the UK and EU. “We expect to see updated recommendations on infant feeding in the not too distant future,” she said.Erin Leichman, a senior research psychologist at St Joseph’s University, Philadelphia, and executive director of the Pediatric Sleep Council said while the impact of early introduction of solid foods likely varied across babies, the findings are important. “Results of this study certainly warrant further research on the topic, particularly addressing how long babies continue to breastfeed despite introduction of solids and how parents interact with their babies at bedtime and during the night after a night waking, which can be related to sleep and night wakings,” she said. “At this point, results of this study do not indicate that solids should be introduced early for all babies.” Making the decision about when to introduce solid foods should be one that is family-based, and made with a trusted health-care provider.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61169768b94ac51b6d088baa698bfee8779871a9/0_142_3630_2178/master/3630.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cab02ded2430e577369d170e4262b9af","title":"flying high kids in the uk are wild about energy drinks but how harmful are they","story":"UK children consume energy drinks at a higher rate than kids in any other country in Europe - with a fifth of three-10-year-olds having them regularly. Is this a health risk, or no worse than coffee?When Red Bull launched in the UK in 1994, with its odd, cough-linctus flavour and novel billing as an “energy drink”, students and clubbers went mad for the stuff. The brand quickly became a cheap and legal staple for staying up all night. A quarter of a century later, the energy drinks market is still growing and flooded with Red Bull competitors such as Relentless, Monster Energy and Emerge. And it is no longer just young adults guzzling them to study or rave into the small hours these brands are catnip to children.Energy drinks are classified as soft drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre. Many brands, however, including Monster, Rockstar and Red Bull (still the world’s bestselling energy drink) contain more than twice that amount. While, at about 300mg per litre, this is less than filter coffee (about 400mg per litre), the drinks are way more quaffable to children. The ESFA say just one can of some brands could exceed their recommended daily caffeine limit for children.Amelia Lake is a reader in public health nutrition at Teeside University and co-author of the 2017 study for which school children were interviewed. “Coffee is very different,” she says. “It’s hot, not necessarily full of sugar and you can’t gulp it down. You can’t have three or four one after another, like you can with these drinks.” With highly palatable flavours such as tropical fruits and blueberry, they are to coffee what alcopops are to vodka.Lake says that the health concerns don’t stop at sugar and caffeine. “There’s the cocktail of the other things in these drinks – the guanine, taurine, various other what are called healthy ingredients. We don’t have a lot of evidence about what the combination does to adults or children.” Taurine is an amino acid found in meat and fish that is claimed to enhance concentration (among its many other biological functions), especially when combined with caffeine and guanine – a stimulant derived from the South American guarana plant.In 2016, Lake and colleagues reviewed the academic literature on energy drinks from Europe and the US. They found associations between consuming the drinks with symptoms including headaches, stomach aches, hyperactivity, insomnia, fatigue and irritation. There were also higher incidences among energy drink fans of injuries, driving violations and road accidents. In the US in 2010-11, the National Poison Data System received 4,854 calls about energy drink cases. Almost half involved children under six years old, but it was among older children that more grave effects such as cardiac rhythm disturbances and hypertension were reported.Furthermore – perhaps indicating that the drinks are seen as a legal high for children – several studies in the review found strong links between choosing energy drinks, sensation seeking and other self-destructive behaviours such as binge-drinking, smoking and substance abuse, along with problems with behavioural regulation and metacognitive skills (such as planning and problem-solving). Lake is keen to point out, however, that, short of conducting unethical experiments that involve dosing children up with caffeine in a laboratory, we are having to make do with associations rather than finding any proof of causation.According to EU labelling guidelines, soft drinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre must carry a warning about the high caffeine content and state that they are not recommended for children. But wouldn’t this make the drinks even more irresistible to children? “I don’t think it’s a silver bullet,” says Lake, “but it’s a good first step.” Some of her research was prompted by concerned parent groups. “There was confusion around who and what these drinks are for, with incidences of children having them for breakfast,” says Lake, lamenting that even though “the cans say they’re not for children, we sell them to children anyway”. Energy drink consumption by children in the UK is the highest in Europe.Earlier this year, the major UK supermarkets committed to not selling the drinks to under-16s, but convenience stores and vending machines are ubiquitous. The government has now proposed a ban on selling the drinks to under-16s, to combat childhood obesity. “If you look wider,” says Lake, “other countries have been ahead of this curve for a while now. Some countries have outright bans some have banned sales to under-18s.”The health secretary has also proposed a 9pm watershed for junk-food advertising, but the way that energy drinks are promoted is many-tentacled. The brands have forged strong associations with gaming, extreme sports, Formula One racing, clubbing and music, using social media, event sponsorship and web content. As Beckett says, the marketing is “very attractive to young people, with a lot of social media, YouTube channels ... Monster has been very savvy advertising through the gaming world. These are whole other areas of a marketing universe that’s on the radar of young people, but not their parents.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ef4f0544b595a2114db9a540734cad7fc66b471/0_2245_4008_2405/master/4008.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=097ffc943bef353960844a452c2c28e8","title":"seven ways to avoid urinary tract infections","story":"Ensuring you drink plenty of water throughout the day may decrease your risk of getting a UTI.Take regular trips to the toilet to empty your bladder. “Holding it in” may result in bacteria having the opportunity to multiply in your urinary tract, giving you an increased risk of infection.Women should be encouraged to empty their bladder after sex. Bacteria can be introduced to the urinary tract during foreplay or sexual intercourse, which should be expelled before the bacteria are allowed to multiply and cause an infection. Additionally, think about what type of contraception you are using – some people find using spermicides can increase UTIs, as can diaphragms.D-Mannose is a natural sugar thought to aid in the removal of E coli during a UTI and stop the infection in its tracks. Recent, small studies have looked at the use of D-Mannose oral powder and compared it with prophylactic antibiotics, and have shown promising results.If you are experiencing UTI symptoms (eg pain on urination, or increased frequency) you should see a doctor, particularly if you suffer from recurring UTIs. You may need a course of antibiotics or possibly an ultrasound scan to investigate the cause of the recurring infection. For example, it could be due to an anatomical abnormality or an inability to fully empty your bladder. A weakened immune system could be causing the repeat infections, which would need further investigation.After visiting the toilet, wiping from back to front can increase the risk of getting a UTI, as you could introduce faecal bacteria into the urinary tract. However, overcleaning is not the answer, as using too many products can alter your flora and raise the risk of getting a UTI.Oestrogen is believed to be protective against UTIs via a variety of mechanisms, meaning that menopausal women with declining oestrogen may be vulnerable to UTIs. In a meta-analysis of five randomised controlled trials, it was found that topical vaginal oestrogen was beneficial in reducing UTIs in post-menopausal women.Cranberries and cranberry juice have long been suggested as treatments for UTIs. But studies have shown mixed data on how successful they are. Cranberries contain proanthocyanidins, believed to prevent bacteria from “clinging on” inside your bladder. But cranberry juice may not be that useful, as it can be minimal in actual cranberry content and full of sugar and additives instead – so make sure you get cranberries in a raw form if you want to try this method. If you try a vodka and cranberry while you have a UTI, be aware that the alcohol may irritate your bladder and bring you back to square one with the symptoms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

It’s a much nicer experience all round seeing an artist you love in a room with a few hundred people, than seeing them in an enormodome or a stadium. For a start, you feel like a participant rather than a spectator. But, sadly, there are artists who just don’t play small rooms (or if they do, you’ve got more chance of winning the Nobel peace prize than getting a ticket), so the enormodome or stadium is the only option.If you write about music, your job takes you to these places on a regular basis. In the past few weeks I have been to Wembley Stadium, Twickenham and the London Stadium I’ve been to the O2 Arena and almost ended up at Wembley Arena too. I feel as if I’ve spent most of the early summer negotiating poor transport, incomprehensible entry arrangements and interminable queues. And, in between times, seeing some musicians. I think I have a pretty good idea about what makes big gigs into big experiences – and an awful lot of it isn’t about the music, sadly.My own perspective is Londoncentric – so please, in the comments, let us know examples of good and bad practice at your nearest mega-venues. Given that people are willing to travel (or have to travel) to the huge shows, it’s useful to know which are the venues worth going to and which to steer clear of. What is it about gig promoters that makes them assume crowds can simply magic themselves in and out of venues? Most of the people involved in a show don’t suffer the same travails as the rest of us – they’re at the venue long before the crowds, and still there long after. The vagaries of rail schedules don’t apply to them. But getting to and from a show can be a massive headache. I have no idea, for example, why anyone books shows at Twickenham. The headquarters of English rugby does have a station nearby, but it is not designed to process huge crowds leaving en masse.Even when the railway network is working perfectly, concertgoers face huge queues getting on to trains afterwards. When the trains are up the spout, as they were after the Rolling Stones show in June, chaos ensues: station after station closed because of overcrowding, and south-west London was littered with people who had travelled from far and wide and had no idea how to get home.Out-of-town venues are no better. Take the Ricoh Arena in Coventry, a regular host for outdoor shows. Yes, there is a dedicated station, but it is served by hardly any trains – and when I visited for Bruce Springsteen a couple of years ago, it was served by absolutely none. The main railway station is six miles away, so we piled into a taxi, which couldn’t get closer than a mile and a half, so we got out and walked. Then there’s the question of how to get back to the city centre in time for the last train. It’s a venue designed to be reached by car, which causes havoc before and after shows. Artists and promoters should ask themselves: how easy is it for fans to get to this venue? And more importantly, how easy is it for them to get home? They may think it’s not their problem, but it is: you book the show, you take responsibility for the fans’ enjoyment, and nothing ruins an evening quite like realising you’re not going to get home till 7am and you’ve got to be at work at 9.This should be simple, shouldn’t it? Is the venue designed to allow as many people as possible a clear view of the stage? Of course, the people at the back are going to be watching giant screens, unfortunately, but has everything else been thought through? Twickenham scores OK for sightlines, actually, which is the only positive thing to say about the stadium. But the London Stadium? Dave Grohl was enthusing about it from the stage at the Foo Fighters show the other week, and I bet it looks great from on stage: it’s hard to imagine a bigger ego boost than a vast bowl filled with people.But from the seats? Not so much. Because it has curved sides, all seats point towards the centre, so every seat in the half of the stadium with the stage in it actually faces away from the stage to some degree. And because of the size of the stadium floor – it’s the size of a football pitch and athletics track – even seats at the halfway line feel as if they are several miles from the stage. At the Foo Fighters, the pitch was crowded right to the back – a rarity at stadium shows. Goodness only knows what the people at the back could see or experience.Ditto park shows. At the end of this week, the annual British Summer Time gigs will get under way in London’s Hyde Park. I’ve had both ends of the stick there: I’m not going to pretend that having wristbands that get you to the front is anything other than great. But I’ve also stood 100 metres from the stage in a completely flat park, unable to see a thing. If you’re going to book parks, try to find ones with some hint of a natural amphitheatre or some aid to the view. We all know stadium shows trade intimacy for spectacle, but there’s no excuse for booking venues at which a decent proportion of the audience can barely see.Is there anything more dispiriting than entering a stadium and seeing row upon row of portable toilets with 25 people waiting in line for each one? Or going to the bar 45 minutes before the headliner and realising, as the queue moves at the pace of the M1 during roadworks season, that you’re going to miss the first 10 minutes of the show? There can come a point where bad facilities become part of the event – that point is called Glastonbury, and it is the only place where horrific toilets somehow become something to celebrate – but that shouldn’t be the case at places designed for the specific function of hosting tens of thousands of people. Of the London stadiums, Wembley is by some distance the best for facilities: I wouldn’t want to celebrate my birthday using their catering, but it does at least exist, and there are plenty of toilets (also, crucially, you don’t feel as if you are in a penal facility in its concourses) the same goes for the O2 Arena. Twickenham is the worst venue for facilities I have ever visited, which is odd, given that it’s the home of English rugby union and you might expect its normal clientele to demand a certain level of civilisation, rather than the horror show its concourses actually are. Park shows are usually even worse: the flood of moans following last weekend’s Liam Gallagher and Queens of the Stone Age shows at Finsbury Park suggested the only good thing about being unable to get served at the bar was that no one needed to use the barely existent toilets.No one disputes the need for security checks, no matter how inconvenient they are. But outdoor shows are huge events , and sometimes halfwitted decisions can make life enormously difficult for punters. Take the London Stadium, with its hellish bridge system – there are five bridges and each ticket has both a bridge number for entry to the stadium area, then a turnstile number to enter the actual stadium. At the Foo Fighters concert, our bridge number was on the opposite side of the stadium from our approach, which was mildly frustrating, but not a big deal – until it became apparent that the turnstile was on the far side of the stadium from our bridge. That is to say: what should have been five minutes from arriving in the area of the stadium to getting inside ended up taking 45 minutes.I’m acutely aware that my stadium and arena experiences are generally better than most. When reviewing, I usually have very good seats. I visit all the venues often enough to know there are some it’s best to leave early, unless I want to add an hour of queuing to get on a train. But even with those advantages, I find that enjoying a huge show happens despite the venue, not because of it.So: what are your models for good and bad mega-shows? Which are the easiest venues to get to and from? Where do you feel least like a piece of livestock being herded to a musical slaughterhouse? Where can you get a drink and go to the toilet without feeling like you’ve used most of the evening doing so, or risked getting some godawful infection in the process?

In an age of melting ice caps and deadly heatwaves, surprisingly few musicians have tackled the calamity awaiting us. But through his increasingly unclassifiable albums, American electronic musician Daniel Lopatin – AKA Oneohtrix Point Never – has been edging towards the precipice for a closer look. His latest, Age Of, is a dizzying synthesis of the concepts he has been toying with since his 2013 album R Plus Seven: high-definition computer music, abstract in shape yet piercingly emotional. Age Of, according to Lopatin, is imagined as the sentimental musings of some advanced artificial intelligence looking back on the follies of humanity. The album evolved from a “concertscape” called Myriad, which Lopatin brings to London on a sticky summer night.The multimedia performance is set against a backdrop of Nate Boyce’s grotesque CGI visuals and hanging sculptures, which loom like aborted HR Giger monsters. Lopatin is flanked by pianist Kelly Moran, drummer and percussionist Eli Keszler, and Aaron David Ross, who plays an array of cinematic synths and special effects They pull off a jaw-dropping performance: a faithful yet fluid rendition of an album that, on record, seems laden with computer-assisted compositional quirks no human could master.Lopatin’s band operate in blinding high-definition as they work through almost every track from Age Of, interspersed with brief, scrambled messages that seem to emanate from the ghoulish sculptures. With virtuosic skill, Moran replicates the knotty neo-baroque melodies of Toys 2 and Age Of, while the glittering chug of Warning harks back to one of Lopatin’s deepest influences, Tangerine Dream. Keszler’s unorthodox drum kit produces cloudbursts of rhythm, as if he was playing a prepared piano. These vivid, top-end details are ballasted by Lopatin and Ross’s thunderous electronics, which unlock the space’s full potential on Same and a seismic We’ll Take It. For an extra twist of surrealism, a troupe of dancing cowgirls rodeo-kick their way around the room during the melancholy outpouring of Black Snow, one of Lopatin’s rare vocal performances. On Babylon, too, his Auto-Tuned warble is tender and affecting – a digital tool adding a human touch.They end on a cover of British freak-folk singer Bill Fay and his cosmically attuned Never Ending Happening (“Just to be a part of it is astonishing to me  The never ending happening”) before dipping into the back catalogue for an encore of Child of Rage and the crowd-pleasing epic Chrome Country.Lopatin’s unpredictable blend of digital and acoustic sound has drawn comparisons with the Fourth World exotica of Brian Eno and Jon Hassell. Those artists used the cutting-edge technology of the 1980s to imagine a world of infinite connections across time and space, yet Lopatin’s vision is less utopian. Age Of is the sound of overload, of data dumps and leaking landfill, of the Anthropocene: the moment when our presence on Earth leaves irreparable geological scars. But where his collaborator Anohni (who adds soaring vocals to several Age Of tracks) warned of environmental collapse in the bleakest terms on her recent album Hopelessness, Lopatin seems more awestruck than alarmed about humanity’s spectacular own goal. He wrings every ounce of emotional resonance from these abstract arrangements, and there is something deeply human about his ability to grasp the sublime in our moment of implosion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/668bec17443a24835af0108deaf67de17cc0a60e/114_372_2809_1685/master/2809.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c90fdaa90f1dd65469a935b0301f0a63","title":"bryn terfel webchat singer falstaff verdi royal opera","story":"The celebrated Welsh bass-baritone brings unique warmth and musicality to everything he sings, from Wagner to showtunes. Join him here on Tuesday 10 July at 1.30pm BST as he answers your questionsBorn the son of a farmer in Pant Glas on the slopes of Snowdon, north Wales, in 1965, Bryn Terfel made his opera debut in 1990, the year after winning the Lieder prize at the Cardiff Singer of the World competition. “He is unmistakably a singer at the start of a brilliant career,” wrote the . Indeed, he’s since sung in all the world’s major opera houses and concert halls, bringing his extraordinary voice, musicality and acting talents to every role he creates, from Wagner’s king of the gods to Sondheim’s demon barber of Fleet Street.He’s duetted with Tom Jones, Rob Bryden and Van Morrison, and performed Rule Britannia at 1994’s Last Night of the Proms clad in a Welsh rugby shirt and wrapped in the red dragon. “Terfel is a born communicator ... and the finest British singer to emerge in the last decade, even if his resemblance to Meatloaf gets more disconcerting as his hair gets longer,” said our critic Andrew Clements.He’s in London this month to sing Verdi’s Falstaff in the Royal Opera House’s revival of Robert Carson’s fine production – a real-life knight singing Shakespeare’s much-loved buffoon.Terfel’s Twitter profile lists him as “bass-baritone, father, golfer, fine-wine collector and MUFC supporter”. He told an interviewer early in his career: “If I hadn’t made it as a singer I’d have been a fireman.” Firefighting’s loss has been music’s gain.

If being a skilled fighter is a prerequisite for one of the toughest jobs in politics, then in his replacement Theresa May has found her man.Dominic Raab, the new Brexit secretary, has a black belt in karate. Davis, when shadow home secretary, was said to have been so impressed that he made the former lawyer and Foreign Office diplomat his chief of staff.It was seen as quite a coup. “Dom is a class act. He’s very calm, very diligent, very thoughtful,” says a Tory insider. “DD really respected him. He was a high flier before he came into politics and he brought that professionalism with him.”Although Raab is an ardent Brexiter, his appointment is less isive than the alternatives. Febrile pro-Brexit MPs are sated, at least temporarily, by having one of their own – a clever, independent-minded one at that – running the show. “Dom is a good thing,” says one. “He’ll hold the prime minister to her promises.” The remainer wing of the party also seem content for now, although some MPs openly question how much power over the process Raab will be able to prise from the steely grip of Downing Street. He is a close friend of leading Tory rebel Dominic Grieve, for whom he was chief of staff before entering parliament in 2010. One remain MP says: “He’s a believer, but we can work with him.”Raab was promoted by David Cameron in 2015, to the Ministry of Justice, but found himself out of a job just a year later when Theresa May took over. There were suggestions that despite Raab being tipped for the top, the prime minister had not forgotten his constant challenges over civil liberties from the backbenches. There was also a “sexism” controversy in the shadows, after he suggested that “‘soft’ feminist bigotry” had become such a problem that it was time “men started burning their briefs”. That assertion drew a stinging rebuke from May, then home secretary.After the 2017 election, that grudge, if it ever existed, was forgiven and he was reappointed to the Ministry of Justice, where he skilfully guided the article 50 legislation through the Commons. A few months later he was moved again, this time to housing, a key issue for the prime minister. Friends, however, said he was disappointed to be away from the Brexit frontline.Raab’s biggest challenge is to persuade Brussels to accept May’s new Brexit plan. He cut his teeth in the late 1990s working for one of the principal Palestinian negotiators of the Oslo peace accords. “He’s very courteous and will always listen to different sides of the argument,” a former colleague says. Raab himself has said: “Whatever people’s views, if they’re honestly held, I’ve got time for them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/396eae34f37faaabd678ffc34a456ec85622fb2c/0_0_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8f80061e7802329ed7c91c26cba7b44","title":"david davis resigns as brexit secretary live updates","story":"Follow live updates after Johnson follows David Davis in resigning from government Dominic Raab replaces Davis as Brexit secretaryAndrea Jenkyns, a Tory Brexiter, says she has received hundreds of emails form people disappointed by the Chequers plan. How can she restore faith in politics.May says she is delivering what people wanted: taking back control of laws, immigration and money, pulling the UK out of the common agriculture policy and the common fisheries policy and allowing the UK to negotiate trade deals.Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, has issued a statement backing Theresa May.Peter Bone, the Conservative Brexiter, says for the first time in 10 years activists in his constituency refused to campaign with him this Saturday because they were so disappointed with the Chequers plan.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, says a Number 10 briefing said any trade deal with the US would have to involve a carve-out for agriculture, because the UK would abide by EU standards.May says that would be an issue regardless of what Brexit deal emerges. The UK will want to maintain standards in some areas, she says. That could constrain a future trade deal. She says another country might want the UK to slash its standards for the sake of a trade deal, but the UK would reject that.But the Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith has applauded Johnson’s decision to resign.In an interview with LBC, David Davis was asked for his reaction to Boris Johnson’s resignation. He replied:Regret, really. I had resigned because this was central. This was central to my job and if we continue with this policy and I was still there, I’d have to present it in the House of Commons. I’d have to present it in Europe. I’d have to be the champion of the policy which I didn’t believe in, so that doesn’t work. Somebody else can do a better job than me under those circumstances. I don’t think it’s central to the foreign secretary. It’s a pity, but there we are.Labour’s Yvette Cooper says no one understands how May’s facilitated customs arrangement would work. She says May has shown that pandering to both sides does not work. She says May should put a plan to the Commons so MPs can vote on it. May cannot just sit there saying “nothing has changed”.May says that is not what she is saying.Labour’s Hilary Benn, the chair of the Commons Brexit committee, asks May to confirm that the transition period will have to be extended because HMRC will need more time to introduce the customs arrangements required by the facilitated customs arrangement.May replies with a single word: “No.”Anna Soubry, the Conservative pro-European, congratulates May on her leadership. But she says she is concerned about the impact of her plan on services.May says the government wants more flexibility on services. It wants to be able to put in place what is necessary to maintain the UK’s leading role in services, not least in financial services.Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, congratulates May on killing off a UK-US free trade deal. He says that cannot take place now because the US would not accept EU rules on food.Sir Bill Cash, the Conservative Brexiter, asks how May reconciles her plan with democratic self-government.May says the UK is leaving the jurisdiction of the European court of justice.

The handover process is something we will plan carefully and commence in detail next summer.” Pivac, who coached Fiji at international level from 2004 to 2007, has been in charge at the Scarlets for the past four seasons, having initially been assistant to Simon Easterby. Under Pivac the Scarlets won the Pro12 title in 2017 and were pipped by Leinster when defending their title in the recently completed season. They also lost to Leinster in the semi-finals of this year’s European Champions Cup.Pivac will continue as Scarlets boss until the end of the 201819 season and will not officially come under WRU employment until July 2019, with Gatland leading Wales into the World Cup. Gatland’s 12-year reign will make him the nation’s longest-serving and most successful head coach. “I know I’m following in the footsteps of someone who is held in extremely high regard, not only by the Welsh public but also by the players who have played under him,” Pivac said. “I will be doing my best to protect the legacy which Warren Gatland, with the help of those players, will inevitably leave behind.

BMC’s Greg van Avermaet will be zipped into it this afternoon. It will mark the beginning of the Belgian’s second spell in the iconic maillot jaune. Bora-Hansgrohe are the last remaining team out on the road and have a little under three kilometres to go. Correction: Philippe Gilbert has a two-second advantage over Greg van Avermaet. His Quick-Step Floors team are about to finish ... Peter Sagan pops! The Bora Hansgrohe is dropped by the rest of his team, who don’t wait for him. They need to crack on and focus on getting the best GC position possible for Rafal Majka. Gilbert in yellow? Should Quick-Step Floors finish this stage one second behind BMC, it would be enough for Philippe Gilbert to take the yellow jersey, assuming Peter Sagan’s Bora Hangrohe team don’t win today’s time trial.Quick-Step Floors going well again: Following their wobble earlier, Quick-Step Floors have five cyclists riding together in procession, but their fifth man is clinging on for dear life as they approach the second checkpoint. They cross the line in 29min 02sec, six seconds off the pace set by BMC. Bora-Hansgrohe pass the first checkpoint: They’re 13 seconds down on the time set by BMC. Disaster for Quick-Step Floors: The Quick-Step Floors team smithereens out on the road, with three riders up front, Fernando Gaviria getting dropped and the rest strung out in between. The trio in front slow down to allow their team-mates to catch up and six of them pedal on together. They’re the only team to mess up like that today and aren’t even halfway yet. Interestingly enough, on ITV’s coverage of the Tour, David Millar has just been bigging up their chances of winning today’s time trial. They’ve just passed the first checkpoint three seconds slower than BMC, so are very much in the mix. If they do win today’s stage, Fernando Gaviria would find himself in yellow. Dimension Data finish: Mark Cavendish leads his team across line, shaking his head in frustration as he does so. Their fourth rider stops the clock at 40min 39sec, a total of 1min 52sec off the pace set by clubhouse leaders BMC. Bora-Hansgrohe set off: Peter Sagan’s team hit the road with the Slovak a vision in yellow. THey’re a decent time tiralling side, but nothing special. They’ll have to do exceptionally well to keep Sagan in yellow today. As things stand, he’ll lose it to BMC’s Greg van Avermaet. Cofidis Solutions Credits finish: Their time of 42min 09sec is significantly worse than any of their rivals and should secure them last place in today’s stage. Team Lotto NL-Jumbo finish. At 40min 02sec, it’s a disappointing effort. Just two teams are left to start their respective races against the clock: Quick-Step Floors and Bora-Hansgrohe. With eight teams out on the road and two to start, we should know the outcome of today’s stage in approximate 45 minutes. Astana roll down the ramp: The national team of Kazakhstan roll down the ramp, without really having a GC rider to call their own. They start with seven riders after the abandonment of Luis Leon Sanchez yesterday. He came off his bike 40 kilometres from the end of yesterday’s stage and tried to continue, but was unable to ride his bike. After being taken to hospital for x-rays, he was found to have a fracture in his elbow and in four of his left ribs. Ouch. Adam Yates speaks: “We did a good time,” the Mitchelton Scott rider tells ITV. “|We’ve got a super strong team here and we work pretty good on these fast courses.” AG2R La Mondiale finish: Romain Bardet’s team clock in at 40min 01sec, well over a minute off the pace. In other news, here’s Peter Sagan’s father getting slightly excited as he watched his son win yesterday’s second stage.The cameras cut to Cofidis: They’re 11 minutes into their spin and the flags on the side of the road suggest they’re being buffeted by incredibly strong crosswinds. Team Sunweb set sail: Meanwhile in the clubhouse, BMC have the lead. As things stand, Greg van Avermaet is the virtual Maillot Jaune. BMC pass the second checkpoint: They have a six second advantage over Team Sky with nine kilometres to go. BMC are going well: With nine kilometres to go, Richie Porte and his associates have a five second advantage over Sky at the moment. Not a good day for Movistar: With just four riders left with him out on the road, Nairo Quintana finishes 49 seconds behind Team Sky. With the losses he’s incurred already, Nairo Quintan’s Tour has “already been holed beneath the waterline”, according to TV’s Ned Boulting. An email: “I’m sympathetic to your correspondent Mr Hindle’s perspective,” writes Will de Quetteville. “Brailsford is very much in danger of succumbing to the belief that he is bigger than Team Sky and its riders. The nature of his comment about Lappartient is that of a rich snob and, at the very least, antagonising the head of the UCI is hardly likely to prove useful to Froome et al going forward. Notwithstanding the fact that Brailsford’s own performance in front of the select committee demonstrated, at best, a suburban grasp of politics.” Team Sky take the lead: Chris Froome and chums finish in a time of 38min 50sec, which looks likely to take some beating. There are 20 other teams yet to finish, of course, but if Sky do hold on, then Geraint Thomas will start tomorrow’s stage in the yellow jersey. Sky approach the finish: Correction: that Mitchelton-Scott time (now corrected) should have read 38min 55sec. With six riders still together, Team Sky have a little over a kilometre to go and look good to overtake the Australian pace-setters. Chris Froome does a long pull on the front, before making way for Egan Bernal. Mitchelton-Scott approach the finish. They’re down to five riders and Adam Yates leads them over the line. They finish in a time of 38min 55sec. Nine teams still to start: BMC Racing are out on the road and past the 13km mark in the same time (14min 13sec) as Mitchelton-Scott and Sky. Team Sky pass the second checkpoint: To a mixture of applause and clearly audible booing from the roadside, Team Sky stop the clock in a time 29min 03sec, four seconds quicker than Mitchelton-Scott.Team Sky down to six riders: Sky have dropped Luke Rowe and Wout POwels and are down to six men out on the road. It’s difficult to know whether this is all part of their plan or they’re having a bad day in the office. We’ll find out soon enough as they’re approaching the second checkpoint at 26.5 kilometres. Mitchelton-Scott just passed it in a time of 29min 06sec. Checkpoint No1: Movistar pass the 13km mark two seconds behind the leaders Mitchelton-Scott. The Australian team and Sky have both dropped one rider each out on the road and are down to seven men each. An email from David Hindle: “Some brass neck from Sir Dave there?” he suggests, referring to the Sky team leader’s attack on the UCI president David Lappartient. “I guess that’s how you get to the top in sport. That and ‘marginal gains’, of course. Do you think we’ll move on to Sir Dave harassing and bullying any critics? Oh. Hang on. It looks like that’s already started. Last time this happened it didn’t end well.” The consensus among Sir Dave’s many vocal critics on social media seems to be that he has been extremely arrogant here. No doubt those who are always eager to fight his and Team Sky’s corner will have a response for our correspondent Mr Hindle, who – if my previous experiences manning the Tour de France are anything to go by - might be well advised to don his tin hat.Mitchelton-Scott pass the first checkpoint. The Aussie outfit clock in at 14min 13sec at the 13-kilometre mark. Sky pass it less than a second down. Groupama-FDJ are away: Sponsored by the French lottery, this team won’t be too concerned about getting a good time today as they don’t have a GC rider among their ranks. Arnaud Demare is their main man. The 26-year-old from Beauvais has won stages in Paris-Nice and the Tour de Suisse this season and recorded third place finishes in Milan-San Remo and Gent-Wevelgem. Movistar are next down the ramp: Nairo Quintana and his team-mates get their pedals turning. The Colombian had a disastrous start to the Tour, crashing near the end of the opening stage and losing over a minute on his rivals. There were questions over who is actually leading Movistar ahead of this race and if Quintana fails to deliver then Mikel Landa or Alejandro Valverde may take on what Rio Ferdinand so memorably called “the mantelpiece”. Team Sky set off. They have never won a TTT at the Tour de France, but have their eyes on the yellow jersey today. After Chris Froome lost 51 seconds after a crash in the opening stage,. they’re hoping to get Geraint Thomas into the race leader’s jersey.Mitchelton-Scott hit the road: Adam Yates is their team leader and has crashed twice already in this Tour and will be hoping for a change of luck today. There are eight riders on each team and the clock stops when the fourth man crosses the finish line. We have checkpoints at Saint-Andre at the 13km mark and Cote de la Seguiniere at the 26.5km. Less than 10 minutes to go: On the UK TV coverage, we’re just a Sun Life Guaranteed Over 50s Plan advert away from the beginning of today’s time trial. The Australian Mitchelton-Scott team will be first down the ramp and their riders are primed and ready to go. Peter Sagan on yesterday’s win: “I have to say a big thanks to my team-mates,” said the Slovak stage winner. “They rode at the front for the last 30km. In the end, I expected something easier but it was a very tough course, with a lot of ups and downs. “I believed it was better to wait as long as possible to launch my sprint. Démare started with Degenkolb. I could overtake them. I was very lucky that Colbrelli didn’t jump fast enough to pass me. I’m very happy to get the yellow jersey too. To wear it for one day or more, it’s always special. We’ll try to keep it after the team time trial. Everything is possible.”Two withdrawals so far: Two riders left the Tour during stage two yesterday, with Astana’s Luis Leon Sanchez abandoning after a heavy fall at a traffic island and Trek-Segafredo’s Tsgabu Grmay quitting due to illness. Grmay had been suffering from abdominal pain in the build-up to the race and said yesterday that they got worse and “it was not possible to go on”.How to ride a team time trial: The Global Cycling Network have no shortage of helpful and informative videos on their YouTube channel. Here, they went behind the scenes at BMC Racing during last year’s Vuelta a Ea to find out the secrets of a good team time trial.Brailsford makes headlines: Team Sky chief Dave Brailsford courted more controversy yesterday when he said UCI president David Lappartient had the mentality of “a local French mayor”. In the build-up to this year’s Tour, Lappartient appeared to suggest that Chris Froome was only cleared of any wrongdoing by Wada and the UCI last week because of his own and Team Sky’s wealth. His comments did not go down well with Brailsford, as Jeremy Whittle explains.Mitchelton Scott are first out today and will be hoping for less of the bad luck that has dogged them over the past two days. Their team leader Adam Yates has crashed twice in the first two stages, while Luke Dudbridge and Daryl Impey both hit the deck yesterday. Their directeur sportif, Matt White, told journalists yesterday that all three riders would be fine for today.“Following the incidents of stage 1, only one Team Sky rider is with almost the same time as most of the other GC contenders. Geraint Thomas is even one second ahead of them after he collected one second of bonification at the bonus point of stage 2. “Hot favourites Team Sky have to beat Bora-Hansgrohe by fifteen seconds to bring the Welshman in the yellow jersey. Their challengers are BMC whose highest ranked rider is Greg Van Avermaet with a deficit of sixteen seconds from Peter Sagan.”Stage two: Peter Sagan sprinted to victory in La Roche-sur-Yon and took the yellow jersey in yesterday’s stage, which was marred by a crash on the final bend. Here’s Jeremy Whittle’s report ...Ten years after hosting an inidual time trial won by Stefan Schumacher, Cholet is the venue for a team version of the Race of Truth in the third stage of this year’s Tour. Here’s William Fotheringham’s take on today’s route from our stage-by-stage guide to this year’s race.“This is the first chance for gaps to open – particularly if it’s breezy or wet – and all eyes will be on Team Sky, who have yet to win a Tour team time trial. It’s not a straightforward blast, peppered with corners and with two little hills after halfway to put any strugglers under pressure.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/856284cf29c77f652dfc7554a03585851b9c8c79/0_52_2040_1224/master/2040.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d316911a0b6ea34f18768cfcb79d7dd","title":"bold as bauhaus how the legendary schools lost typefaces were recreated in pictures","story":"Experts have trawled the archives at the renowned German school of design, to create a series of fonts from fragments of typeface treasures by original Bauhaus students.

Eldorado was meant to be the new EastEnders – but 25 years since it was axed, it’s still a byword for disasterKai Maurer didn’t know that bleaching his hair would change his life. It was 1992 and the 18-year-old German was bumming around in southern Spain, searching for sun and all the other Ss. He dyed his long brown hair blond for a bet.Next thing he knew, a British TV production was looking to cast a young, blond German for some filming they were doing in the area. Kai went along. He hadn’t really done any acting before, but he’d played the trumpet as a kid, he’d been on a stage. And the audition went well, he got the part. In Eldorado. “I had no idea what anyone was talking about,” Maurer tells me today, over a quarter of a century on. “They were all going, ‘This is for the BBC, it’s going to be big like EastEnders, do you have any inkling how big?’ And I said, ‘No idea. I don’t even know what the BBC is.’”Eldorado’s final episode was broadcast 25 years ago this week. Today the soap opera, said to have cost the BBC £10m, is synonymous with extravagant fiasco. As in, be careful, it could all go Eldorado or we might have an Eldorado on our hands. The BBC hasn’t commissioned an open-ended soap since.It started so hopefully. The early 90s saw peak ratings cold war between the superpowers. ITV had Coronation Street and Emmerdale, the BBC just EastEnders. With the government breathing down its neck, the Beeb needed to add a cruise missile to its arsenal, in order to increase its market share, justify the licence fee, and perhaps its very existence. There was a competition, and a winner: EastEnders creator Tony Holland’s idea about expat Brits living in Spain. It had the key ingredients of a good soap: a sense of real community, of claustrophobia and isolation. There would be Germans and Scandinavians around the place, but it would centre on the Brits who brought their country with them. Little England was the original name. Tony Jordan, then a rookie writer on EastEnders, was brought in by Holland: he wrote Eldorado’s very first episode. Jordan remembers the hype growing until “at some point the commercial people started thinking, ‘Hang on, we’re part of Europe now, this could be the first Eurosoap, that could play not just in the UK but all over Europe.’ It became bastardised, those other nationalities were not on the periphery, they were in the centre. You had all these people tying themselves in knots in this kind of Europudding.”Jordan also talks about the terrible rush. Transmission was dragged forward to throw a curveball at ITV. The entire village they were building in Spain at a cost of £2m was hardly ready casting was rushed. As well as established actors, unknowns were hired – people like Kai Maurer. It couldn’t be called Little England any more, so it became Eldorado. The first episode aired on 6 July 1992 – and it was awful.The critics hated it. ’s Nancy Banks-Smith said it had “the look of a situation comedy whose laughter track has been lost” and wished for a tidal wave to wash the whole thing away. The punters hated it, too. The first episode had an audience appreciation index of 37, among the worst in memory. They’d hoped for 10 million viewers, but by the end of the first month the Friday episode (Eldorado originally went out three times a week) got just 2.8 million – fewer than Panorama. A year later the show that was supposed to save the Beeb’s ass was axed. Brake thinks the show was too ambitious, that it should have started more gently. But soon it was going out five times a week. “We were told we would have siestas in the afternoon, because we were terribly hot, and I remember one cameraman falling over because they were working so hard in the great heat.”She wasn’t convinced by the policy of hiring unknowns. “Some of the casting was unbelievably bad, considering how much talent we have in this country,” she says. Brake, who had worked with the RSC alongside Judi Dench and Ian Richardson, was now starring with Kai the German beach bum. Hey, he had been on stage, too, remember, even if it was only to blow his trumpet. Actually, if you look back at Eldorado now Kai is by no means the worst.Kai’s lines were in English. Some of the other actors spoke their own languages – Spanish, Swedish, Danish – which might have been authentic but also meant that most viewers didn’t know what the hell they were saying. Subtitles were added later, though a primetime popular audience wasn’t ready for them in the early 90s. “I think it may well have been ahead of its time,” says Kai. “Multiculturalism, there you have it, God knows how many different European nationalities under one roof.”Even the English bits weren’t always easy to understand – the sound quality was terrible. It turned out that a very expensive, purpose-built Spanish village had very echoey acoustics. The set still stands on the Costa Del Sol it’s used for paintballing. In spite of the stick it was getting, everyone I speak to who worked on it has fond memories of Eldorado. It might have been hard work, and not very good, but it was a lot of fun. Derek Martin, who played a gangster with a yacht, says the drive to work from his villa in the village of Mijas to the set, was the best he’s ever done. “We were all sad that it packed in,” he says. “The reason was because Mr Alan Yentob went to BBC One. If it had failed, it would’ve been his baby. But at the time it was shut down, it was getting eight million viewers. That should’ve been a licence to go again.”Eight million in 1993, when most viewers had a choice of four channels, wasn’t as many as eight million is today, but it’s a lot more than 2.8 million. A new producer had been brought in, new actors hired, some of the worst non-actors fired Eldorado had, to some extent, been turned around. Now it wasn’t really really bad, just not very good. And not very good wasn’t good enough for the new head of BBC One.So what does Yentob, who inherited Eldorado from his predecessor Jonathan Powell, have to say for himself? “There had been chaos up there, problems on the set, a change of producer, lots of things weren’t working. We saw costs not coming down, and I had other things in mind that would have been difficult to achieve given the investment in Eldorado.” Plus it was awful? “It was, and there you are. But when people are losing their jobs, it’s difficult to be that negative. I gave it a bit of a chance for a few weeks, looked at whether it was potentially going to get better. But, despite the fact it had a good producer, she couldn’t rehabilitate it, so, yes, I cancelled it.” Nancy’s tidal wave had finally arrived, in the form of Alan Yentob. Protests ensued from angry fans. “The stick has not stopped,” Yentob says. “People have been campaigning for it to be revived for such a long time. I’m sure people are sticking pins into pictures of me day and night. Which they are anyway.”Martin, who went on to play Charlie Slater in EastEnders, has heard rumours of an Eldorado reprisal. Now 85, would he go back? “Right now, this minute.”For Brake, just 76, it might not have been the long-term, mortgage-busting job she’d hoped it was going to be. “I think it was the end of my career really. Everything I’m proud of I did before.” But she’s not bitter it worked out well for her personally. If she’d stayed in Spain, she wouldn’t have met her husband. As for Maurer, it was something of a beginning. “I did it the wrong way round didn’t I?” he laughs. “I then went to the UK and I studied acting. I thought, ‘Right, I’m going to see what this is all about, see if I can improve anything.’ What has improved is I don’t sound German any more.”Not as German anyway. The acting lasted a while, but he found the only parts he was getting were comedy Germans or Nazis. He got tired of trying to impress casting directors: it was never as easy as it was that first time in Spain. He stayed in Britain, but changed career. Twenty-five years after the sun went down on Eldorado, Kai’s a flying instructor at Rochester airport, overlooking the River Medway in Kent.Oh and Jordan, who went on to become one of the biggest names in television writing, thinks it would be a good idea to bring it back. “Drama is a very crowded space,” he says. “We’re constantly looking for things that will make a noise, bring in an audience. If there was a broadcaster brave enough and smart enough to do a version of Eldorado, they’d get an immediate audience, though to keep them they’d have to give them a good show.” Over to you, broadcasters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13da3709cd2be63df652bed5f5c8ee8cda28335d/434_678_6046_3628/master/6046.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13f790e4d79c0ebe02ec3a0eed07428d","title":"electric scooter paris mobile app lime startup","story":"Try as I might, I just can’t get behind the idea that riding a scooter is suddenly cool. Phoebe Bridgers, an indisputably hip musician, nearly pulled it off when she scooted around Los Angeles in last summer’s video for her song Motion Sickness, but even then the effect was charmingly dorky. No one, not even someone who is actually cool, can scoot without looking like an oversized child.Still, it is 2018 and we all need to face our prejudices. So I headed into Paris to try out the first “free-floating” electric scooters available for hire in Europe, left out on the streets and controlled with a mobile\u0026nbspapp.I have lived in the French capital for three years, mostly navigating it by bike. Now, it is the testing ground for US startups’ grand plans of conquering Europe with a craze that has swept dozens of US cities from Washington DC to San Francisco. To their fans, e-scooters are quick, cheap and moderately green, plus you get to pretend you are a big kid. For some city officials, however, they are a menace a regulatory headache and a source of potential accidents, with abandoned scooters, and sometimes their drivers, strewn across pavements.The Paris scheme launched on 21 June and is operated by Lime, one of a handful of Californian scooter startups that have been hurtling along a dizzying trajectory, raising hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital in a matter of\u0026nbspmonths.The Lime scooters are solid but fairly lightweight, easy to spot thanks to their bright green motors and nippy, with a maximum speed of 15 miles (24km) an hour. You locate the nearest one with the app and turn it on by scanning the QR code on the handlebars. At this point you are charged €1 (£0.88) – $1 in the US – then it is 15 cents for every minute of ride time.On this morning there are more than 200 scooters scattered around central Paris. Stateside, Lime operates a scheme whereby members of the public can get paid to take them home and charge them. But for now at least, a 40-strong staff in Paris has been picking them up each night, charging them and putting them back on the streets, ready for the morning. The scooters are clustered around the city centre, making them an impractical option for commuters living beyond the tourist zone, including myself, although Lime France says it will be adding more imminently.I decide to test one near Notre-Dame cathedral and track down four with the app on the Pont Neuf bridge. My chosen steed unlocks smoothly, and I’m off. I initially hoped to take to scooting like a sort of Parisian Marty McFly, zooming into the rush hour with a tug on the throttle and an insouciant shrug. In reality, my debut is ungainly and I jerk along for a couple of metres before coming to an uncertain stop. Still, it is pretty easy to get the hang of: brake with your left hand, push the throttle with your left, allez!The early adopters of the scooters are mostly young and techy. Kévin Ghanbarzadeh, the French celebrity gamer better known as Shaunz, was among the first European converts after testing Lime’s arch-rival Bird – the fastest startup ever to reach the coveted “unicorn” status of a $1bn (£750m) valuation, and now set to hit double that – on a recent trip to Miami. “I was so surprised to see this scheme arrive in France that I couldn’t wait to try it,” says the 26-year-old. “It doesn’t cost much and you can go pretty fast. I wouldn’t use it that often, but occasionally, yes – to go out with a friend, or to come back after a night out instead of the Métro or an Uber.”Parisians are quick to slap down my opinion that e-scooters are for losers. “They used to be a bit uncool, but they have been cropping up in Paris for a few years,” says Camille Pailleret, a management consultant trying one out for the first time. “Now, they have really been democratised and are kind of neat.“The metro and buses are so crowded that I thought it would be interesting to try something that would let me breathe a bit,” she adds, giving it a big thumbs up as she zooms off.Lime, Bird and other startups – Uber and its rival Lyft are tipped to enter the scooter market – are banking on large numbers of Europeans falling for scooters as Americans have. Local companies are also entering the fray, with Brussels firm Troty launching a dockless service in the Belgian capital on 29 June.The prospects of taking one for a spin in the UK are slim, though. E-scooters, like hoverboards and Segways, are banned from UK roads and pavements, and the Department for Transport says there are no plans to change the rules. But there will be plenty of places to try them out on the continent. Lime, which has nearly a million users of its scooters and e-bikes in 60 US cities, wants to be in more than 25 European cities by the end of the year.“We are pretty aggressive in terms of expansion,” says Arthur-Louis Jacquier, director of Lime France. As for Paris, he insists the company is here to stay, despite the scepticism, given the mixed fortunes of Parisian transport ventures of late. Jacquier was previously European vice-president for Gobee.bike, one of several dockless cycle providers that have popped up in Paris since late last year. The Hong Kong-based company quit the French capital, along with several other European cities, within a few months after thousands of its bikes were stolen or\u0026nbspvandalised.Jacquier says the bicycles had faced two main problems – mindless violence and bad parking, which irritated residents – but that Lime has fixes for both. “Because we retrieve our scooters every night to charge them and repair them if needed, we are able to protect our fleet from vandalism. And in the morning we can deploy them in places where it is not annoying for\u0026nbspanybody.” But like the free-floating hire bikes, the scooters are already irritating some Parisians by adding to growing clutter on pavements. “I nearly threw one into the Seine last night,” says Vincent Jarousseau, a documentary photographer. He was furious after crashing into a scooter that had toppled on to a riverside cycle path and suffering a bad fall from his bike.Paris follows a long list of US cities that have wrestled with how to regulate scooters to minimise accidents. San Francisco has temporarily pulled them from its streets and is set to bring in a tentative cap of 1,250 across a maximum of five companies. For now, the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has settled for a code of conduct, signed by Lime along with dockless bike operators. This, notably, gives them just 24 hours to pick up wrecked vehicles that lie abandoned against rubbish bins and\u0026nbsptrees.“These operators will not stay long in Paris – and won’t have a profitable business – unless they are accepted by Parisians and have a minimum amount of discipline,” says Hidalgo’s deputy for urban planning, Jean-Louis Missika.Disciplined or not, some experts are sceptical of the scooters’ chances of survival in the City of Light. “Something that works in San Francisco won’t necessarily work in Paris,” says Nicolas Louvet, director of transport consultancy 6t. “The public transport is completely different – plus it’s a lot easier to walk around Paris.” (The city is extremely compact for a capital.)One aspect in Lime’s favour is that it has arrived in Paris at a particularly chaotic time for its transport network. The once popular Vélib docking bikes are in meltdown following a disastrous rollout of an “upgrade”, which has left their 300,000 users looking for other options. The Autolib electric car-share scheme is shutting down at the end of July, mired in debt. “There is a lot of stuff in the mix and some of it will disappear,” says Louvet.He describes Parisians as “spoiled children” when it comes to transport, presented with an ever-changing array of options to try and then give up when something new appears – which will, he says, because services such as Lime are operating under a hugely competitive, fast-moving model where “they have to keep reinventing themselves”.As for me, I can’t say I will be switching from cycling for my daily commute.

Photograph:  Nick Bradshaw Irish Water’s senior management will meet this morning to assess the ongoing drought despite expectations of “scattered showers” crossing Ireland by the end of the week.Reports on water usage from the utility’s Northwest, Southern and Eastern and Midlands regions will be used to assess the possible need for further restrictions following the all-areas hosepipe ban.Already Irish Water has restrictions in place in a number of towns, with 8,000 consumers in Athlone, Co Westmeath, on reduced pressure overnight. A similar situation is affecting Portlaoise, with 5,000 people experiencing reduced pressure. There are also concerns about the supply in Galway city and coastal areas as day-trippers flocked to the seaside over the weekend.In recent days Met Éireann said soil moisture levels were so low that a week of sustained rainfall would be necessary before the lakes and rivers start to recover from the drought. The latest forecast is for “scattered showers” from Wednesday onwards, but temperatures will remain in the low 20s over the weekend.The State’s high dependency on ground water supplies are particularly vulnerable to drought, according to Irish Water. Senior management will assess the three regional reports at a meeting this morning, and “issue a statement if there is any change”.On Saturday Irish Water said the possibility of no rain falling in the near future could lead to further restrictions, such as night-time pressure reductions being extended to the commercial sector. If these measures prove insufficient, Irish Water would have to consider wider reductions in water pressure, and a ban on all non-essential usage, including window washing and watering sports pitches.Irish Water’s helpline had received fewer than 40 reports of people breaking the domestic hosepipe ban last Thursday, the evening before the Dublin ban was extended to all areas. Further analysis of the reports will be available over coming days.Defying the ban can attract a fine of up to €125, but the majority of calls have been from people seeking clarification or advice on restrictions and outages, Irish Water said. A spokesperson said people could see the effects of the water shortage in the burnt grass and most people were behaving responsibly.In Northern Ireland the authorities have “strongly advised” the public to adhere to the ban “as ignoring it will only cause further strain on resources and could lead to interruptions to supply”.The company’s CEO Sara Venning said, “we have maximised our water production and need customers’ help to reduce demand. We are asking customers to take heed of the hose pipe ban and stop non-essential water use - using hoses and sprinklers is causing demand to exceed the capacity to supply.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Heavy rain has been followed by 30 degree temperatures, fuelling fears of heatstrokeCharges in landmark press freedom case carry maximum penalty of 14 yearsOfficials say conditions still good for rescue mission, with water levels in cave declining\u0027We will have to do the next mission as successfully as the one we did today\u0027Boys were each led by two ers as they travelled 4km through pitch darknessBid to free remaining eight boys and their coach due to resume this morningEight boys and coach remain in flooded cave after team of ers free fourTeam of 18 ers attempts to bring trapped boys and coach out of narrow, submerged cavesMore than 60 people are missing, 100 in hospital and 1000 stranded in Kurashiki cityPompeo claim of progress is contradicted by North Korea, says trust between states \u0026lsquomay falter\u0026rsquoCoach with the 12 trapped boys apologises to their parents in a letterMonsoon rains could seal 12 boys and soccer coach inside cave complex for monthsSamarn Kunan (38) may be \u0026lsquopromoted\u0026rsquo posthumously in tributeRescue and recovery operation underway as 23 iniduals remain missingConviction over family\u0026rsquos purchase of London flats a big blow to party ahead of electionStatue of Hindu warrior king Shivaji, twice as high as Statue of Liberty, would be colossal waste, say criticsAsahara and six other members of Aum Shinrikyo cult, which gassed Tokyo subway in 1995, hangedRescuers say 12 boys may be able to walk out if cave route can be drained quickly enoughAs Mike Pompeo returns to Pyongyang for talks, scepticism grows about Kim\u0026rsquos intentionsSoccer team, some of whom cannot swim, will be taught to e for delicate operation"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3558980.1531146738!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"am i bovvered eu shrugs its shoulders at davis resignation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commission chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier with then Brexit secretary David Davis  at 10 Downing Street on February 5th last.   Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA Wire“Am I bovvered?” as the comedian Catherine Tate used to say. The EU Commission was unconcerned at the David Davis resignation to the point of almost insulting the man.The purpose for chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas, \u0026nbspat the commisison’s daily lunchtime press briefing, held before the resignation of Boris Johnson, was to avoid giving hostages to fortune, specifically to headlines like “Commission warns of chaos” or “Commission says resignation irrelevant”. So, better say nothing.Was there nothing he would like to say in tribute to Davis’s sterling role as chief Brexit negotiator, The  asked him. Nothing.Asked if Davis’s resignation was a problem: “Not for us”.Was there no panic in the commission ranks, no concern that the Brexit talks might be affected? \u0026nbspPanic? Qui, nous? “In this house it is very clear that our position has always been very cool. We avoided positioning the commission in terms of psychological elements – concern, enthusiasm, disappointment and so on. We are here to do a job.”Indeed, a job that notionally includes providing journalists with a commission perspective on events such as Davis’s resignation.Others, officials and diplomats alike, were a little bit more forthcoming when asked to “react”, \u0026nbspthough all off the record.Most were quick to point out that Davis actually spent very little time in Brussels negotiating. A total of four hours this \u0026nbspyear, according to official records. He would hardly be missed. A much-vaunted warm relationship with his EU counterpart Michel Barnier – their shared hillwalking passion was often mentioned – was largely for show.It wasn’t only that Davis’s role in the talks was never central, a role assumed week in week out by Olly Robbins, the civil servant who is Theresa May’s chief EU adviser and strategist, but the latter had effectively usurped his position in the chain of command. “There have been clear tensions for some time,” one diplomatic source\u0026nbspobserved.Robbins has drafted most of the policy documents and May’s key speeches and many of these have reportedly not even been seen by the now former Brexit secretary until they were about to be delivered. Some reports suggest he had been out of the loop on the White Paper discussed at cabinet, due to be published this week.Had Robbins resigned, Brussels would have been deeply concerned. And offiicials here were wondering if Davis’s replacement, Dominic Raab, has sought any assurances on a diminished role for Robbins, or his own access to the prime minister and role in Brexit policymaking. Reports from London, on the contrary, suggest his department will be scaled back.Now, of course, Boris Johnson has resigned too.There is speculation in Brussels about whether the resignations mark a significant shift in the balance of forces in the British cabinet. Raab’s appointment maintains the numerical balance between hard and soft Brexit adherents, but there is also a political dynamic at play in the sidelining of two of the Brexit big beasts. The resignations were being seen as a reflection of weakness of the hardline Brexit camp, of their political defeat at Chequers, and their likely muzzling by May if they remained in cabinet. It does not appear to be the confident opening of a new line of attack to overthrow May. The numbers are simply not there.That may change, if there is a further rush out the door, but the calls from Brexiteers on May to go now ring rather hollow.Crucially, diplomats and officials say that they do not believe there will be any slowdown in the talks process. Schinas insisted on the availability of the commission 247 and through the summer for talks.Nor is there any expectation that the resignation will deflect the UK from the line set out by Theresa May in Chequers last Friday. Although most EU and diplomatic sources suggest she has not gone far enough in her new proposals – specifically in her attempts to distinguish between goods and services aspects of the single market or on free movement, or specifics on the backtsop \u0026nbsp– there is a general willingness to get down to talking as soon as the UK delivers its White Paper. That is still expected on Thursday."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3559067.1531148987!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit secretary david davis resigns over may s proposals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDavid Davis  resigned while Dominic Raab replaced his position in the cabinet. Photograph: John PhillipsGetty ImagesUK Brexit secretary David Davis resigned on Sunday night, plunging the British government into crisis.His resignation was swiftly followed by that of fellow Department for Exiting the EU ministers Steve Baker and Suella Braverman. It forces May to reshuffle her government, at the same time as trying to convince backbenchers to support her plan. British foreign secretary Boris Johnson resigned on Monday afternoon.Mr Davis sent a bluntly worded resignation letter to the prime minister, saying he would not be a “reluctant conscript” to the plan agreed at Chequers, which he said was “certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense”.He has told friends he cannot live with the soft Brexit stance agreed between ministers on Friday, which proposes a “UK-EU free trade area”, governed by a “common rule book”.Mr Davis is said to have been “livid” about hostile briefing from senior figures in Downing Street about how Brexiters would be treated at Chequers – including suggestions they would be given the number of a local taxi firm if they chose to resign.May had to confront furious pro-Brexit MPs in parliament on Monday, knowing she has lost the backing of one of the leavers’ champions in government.Downing Street was publicly bullish on Monday, with Dominic Raab replacing Davis in the role of UK Brexit secretary. The prime minister is facing a growing backlash from the pro-Brexit wing of her party, with MPs warning they are prepared to trigger a leadership contest.If at least 48 MPs send letters to Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the powerful backbench 1922 Committee, he would have to call a vote of no confidence – though many of May’s supporters in the parliamentary party believe she could win it.Dozens of Tory MPs have attended emergency briefings in Downing Street since the Chequers summit on Friday, at which Boris Johnson said that colleagues would be “polishing a turd” if they tried to defend the plans to the party and public.The pro-Brexit Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns said it was time for May to be replaced. “Honestly, I think yes,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“The time has come that we need a Brexiteer prime minister, really - somebody who clearly believes in Brexit and is really prepared to deliver what the people voted for.”Her fellow Tory MPs “need to think long and hard over the next few days”, Jenkyns added.Davis had clashed with May on several occasions in recent weeks, including over when the long-awaited White Paper setting out the government’s Brexit position should be published.He would prefer a much looser, Canada-style relationship with the EU27 after Brexit – a proposal rejected by the cabinet on Friday.In her reply to Davis’s resignation letter, the prime minister emphasised he had quit “when we are only eight months from the date set in law” for the UK to leave the EU. She rejected his characterisation that the policy agreed at Chequers on Friday would not bring powers back from Brussels to Britain.He told Reuters the resignation was “crucially important” because it showed the extent of concerns about the Chequers agreement. “If the Brexit secretary could not support them they cannot genuinely be delivering Brexit,” he said.The prime minister also plans a fresh round of high-level diplomacy this week, in a bid to persuade the EU27 not to reject her plan outright.She is expected to talk directly to European leaders including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. –  ServiceDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Getty ImagesiStockphotoA resolution to encourage breastfeeding was expected to be approved quickly and easily by the hundreds of government delegates who gathered this spring in Geneva for the United Nations-affiliated World Health Assembly. Based on decades of research, the resolution says that mother’s milk is healthiest for children and countries should strive to limit the inaccurate or misleading marketing of breast milk substitutes. Then the US delegation, embracing the interests of infant formula manufacturers, upended the deliberations. American officials sought to water down the resolution by removing language that called on governments to “protect, promote and support breastfeeding” and another passage that called on policymakers to restrict the promotion of food products that many experts say can have deleterious effects on young children.When that failed, they turned to threats, according to diplomats and government officials who took part in the discussions. Ecuador, which had planned to introduce the measure, was the first to find itself in the cross hairs. The Americans were blunt: If Ecuador refused to drop the resolution, Washington would unleash punishing trade measures and withdraw crucial military aid. The Ecuadorean government quickly acquiesced. The showdown over the issue was recounted by more than a dozen participants from several countries, many of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the United States. Health advocates scrambled to find another sponsor for the resolution, but at least a dozen countries, most of them poor nations in Africa and Latin America, backed off, citing fears of retaliation, according to officials from Uruguay, Mexico and the United States.“We were astonished, appalled and also saddened,” said Patti Rundall, policy director of the British advocacy group Baby Milk Action, who has attended meetings of the assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organisation, since the late 1980s.“What happened was tantamount to blackmail, with the US holding the world hostage and trying to overturn nearly 40 years of consensus on the best way to protect infant and young child health,” she said. In the end, the Americans’ efforts were mostly unsuccessful. It was the Russians who ultimately stepped in to introduce the measure – and the Americans did not threaten them. The State Department declined to respond to questions, saying it could not discuss private diplomatic conversations. The US Department of Health and Human Services, the lead agency in the effort to modify the resolution, explained the decision to contest the resolution’s wording but said HHS was not involved in threatening Ecuador.“The resolution as originally drafted placed unnecessary hurdles for mothers seeking to provide nutrition to their children,” an HHS spokesman said in an email. “We recognise not all women are able to breastfeed for a variety of reasons. These women should have the choice and access to alternatives for the health of their babies, and not be stigmatised for the ways in which they are able to do so.” The spokesman asked to remain anonymous in order to speak more freely.Although lobbyists from the baby food industry attended the meetings in Geneva, health advocates said they saw no direct evidence that they played a role in Washington’s strong-arm tactics. The €60 billion industry, which is dominated by a handful of US and European companies, has seen sales flatten in wealthy countries in recent years, as more women embrace breastfeeding. Overall, global sales are expected to rise by 4 per cent in 2018, according to Euromonitor, with most of that growth occurring in developing nations.The intensity of the administration’s opposition to the breastfeeding resolution stunned public health officials and foreign diplomats, who described it as a marked contrast to the Obama administration, which largely supported the WHO’s long-standing policy of encouraging breastfeeding.During the deliberations, some American delegates even suggested the United States might cut its contribution to the WHO, several negotiators said. Washington is the single largest contributor to the health organisation, providing $845 million (€720 million), or roughly 15 per cent of its budget, last year. The confrontation was the latest example of the Trump administration siding with corporate interests on numerous public health and environmental issues. In talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Americans have been pushing for language that would limit the ability of Canada, Mexico and the United States to put warning labels on junk food and sugary beverages, according to a draft of the proposal reviewed by the New York Times.During the same Geneva meeting where the breastfeeding resolution was debated, the United States succeeded in removing statements supporting soda taxes from a document that advises countries grappling with soaring rates of obesity. The Americans also sought, unsuccessfully, to thwart a WHO effort aimed at helping poor countries obtain access to lifesaving medicines. Washington, supporting the pharmaceutical industry, has long resisted calls to modify patent laws as a way of increasing drug availability in the developing world, but health advocates say the Trump administration has ratcheted up its opposition to such efforts.The delegation’s actions in Geneva are in keeping with the tactics of an administration that has been upending alliances and long-established practices across a range of multilateral organisations, from the Paris climate accord to the Iran nuclear deal to Nafta. Ilona Kickbusch, director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, said there was a growing fear that the Trump administration could cause lasting damage to international health institutions like the WHO that have been vital in containing epidemics like Ebola and the rising death toll from diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the developing world.“It’s making everyone very nervous, because if you can’t agree on health multilateralism, what kind of multilateralism can you agree on?” Kickbusch asked. A Russian delegate said the decision to introduce the breastfeeding resolution was a matter of principle. “We’re not trying to be a hero here, but we feel that it is wrong when a big country tries to push around some very small countries, especially on an issue that is really important for the rest of the world,” said the delegate, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media.He said the United States did not directly pressure Moscow to back away from the measure. Nevertheless, the US delegation sought to wear down the other participants through procedural manoeuvres in a series of meetings that stretched on for two days, an unexpectedly long period.In the end, the United States was largely unsuccessful. The final resolution preserved most of the original wording, though American negotiators did get language removed that called on the WHO to provide technical support to member states seeking to halt “inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children”.The United States also insisted that the words “evidence-based” accompany references to long-established initiatives that promote breastfeeding, which critics described as a ploy that could be used to undermine programmes that provide parents with feeding advice and support.Elisabeth Sterken, director of the Infant Feeding Action Coalition in Canada, said four decades of research have established the importance of breast milk, which provides essential nutrients as well as hormones and antibodies that protect newborns against infectious disease.A 2016 study in the Lancet found that universal breastfeeding would prevent 800,000 child deaths a year across the globe and yield €250 billion in savings from reduced health care costs and improved economic outcomes for those reared on breast milk.Scientists are loath to carry out double-blind studies that would provide one group with breast milk and another with breast milk substitutes. “This kind of ‘evidence-based’ research would be ethically and morally unacceptable,” Sterken said.Abbott Laboratories, the Chicago-based company that is one of the biggest players in the $70 billion baby food market, declined to comment. Nestlé, the Switzerland-based food giant with significant operations in the United States, sought to distance itself from the threats against Ecuador and said the company would continue to support the international code on the marketing of breast milk substitutes, which calls on governments to regulate the inappropriate promotion of such products and to encourage breastfeeding.In addition to the trade threats, Todd C Chapman, the US ambassador to Ecuador, suggested in meetings with officials in Quito, the Ecuadorean capital, that the Trump administration might also retaliate by withdrawing the military assistance it has been providing in northern Ecuador, a region wracked by violence spilling across the border from Colombia, according to an Ecuadorean government official who took part in the meeting.The US Embassy in Quito declined to make Chapman available for an interview. “We were shocked because we didn’t understand how such a small matter like breastfeeding could provoke such a dramatic response,” said the Ecuadorean official, who asked not to be identified because she was afraid of losing her job. – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"child could have left without mother","story":"digitalservices@telegraphdigitalservices@telegraphEight days after giving birth Nina Khaira would be back in hospital: this time fighting for her life.Nina – a 38-year-old dentist from Cornwall – had contracted sepsis, triggered by a urinary tract infection that spread to her blood.The strain of bacteria responsible – ESBL E. coli – was resistant to most antibiotics, including those her GP had prescribed.Dr Nina Khaira was back in hospital just eight days after giving birth to her daughter, Vega.

But large numbers were killed in the early 1900s by a mysterious epidemic, and their population was then devastated as foxes spread across south-eastern Australia.The new pups offering hope to a species of marsupial devastated by foxesThey were last regularly seen on the mainland in the 1960s in the Sydney region.Australian National University researcher Natasha Robinson said the new colony had demonstrated several vital points needed for a successful long-term future.We\u0027ve proven the quolls can find food, shelter and breed. We\u0027ve also shown a capacity to make changes to improve the quolls survival rate, she said.Please review our commenting policyBoris Johnson resigns as Foreign Secretary as pressure builds on Theresa May\u0026#39s leadership - latest newsJunior doctors too overworked for essential training, report warnsIndia should repeal laws that discriminate against leprosy patients, says supreme courtRyanair strikes: When are they and which flights are affected?Who could be the next Tory leader if Theresa May is ousted?

other than in photographs released by Kensington Palace - since making his public debut on the steps of the Lindo Wing.Prince George gurgled and blew bubbles ahead of his christening in 2013, while Princess Charlotte was seen crying as she was about to be taken into church in 2015.Charlotte - who is three - is becoming known for her polished public appearances where she confidently gives a royal wave for the cameras.Royal christenings through the years, in picturesWill Prince George get bored?George was spotted looking less than enthused at the Trooping the Colour celebrations in 2017.George, who is nearly five, is expected to join his family for the 40-minute church service, but royal nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo could be on hand in her traditional Norland uniform to look after her charges.William and Kate\u0027s choice of godparents offers an insight into their trusted inner circle.In the past, the Duke and Duchess have chosen close friends and confidantes including their university friend Oliver Baker and Kate\u0027s school friend Sophie Carter.The Duchess of SussexIt will be the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s first time at a royal christening if she attends as expected.All eyes will be on the Duchess\u0027s choice of outfit and if she continues her trend of opting for a neutral palette.Royal fans will also be looking for signs of broodiness as she joins the Cambridges\u0027 young children at the service.Royal babies are baptised in the same intricate cream lace christening gown.It is a replica of a 19th century one used for most of Queen Victoria\u0027s children which is now too delicate to wear.At the christening of William\u0027s children, there has usually been a poignant nod to the duke\u0027s late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, who was killed in a car crash in 1997.The princess\u0027s friend Julia Samuel was made George\u0027s godmother, while Diana\u0027s niece Laura Fellowes is one of Charlotte\u0027s.The Chapel Royal is where Diana\u0027s coffin lay before her funeral to allow her family to pay their last respects.Royal christenings are steeped in tradition, with customs passed down through the generations.When Prince Louis is baptised on Monday at the Chapel Royal, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expected to keep to convention.Louis is expected to wear the royal christening robe - a replica of the original Honiton lace and satin robe made in 1841 for Queen Victoria\u0027s eldest daughter.The new robe was created by the Queen\u0027s dresser Angela Kelly. The original cream lace and white satin robe was last used in 2004 and is too delicate to be worn.According to tradition, the water used for Louis\u0027s christening will be holy water from the River Jordan, where it is said Jesus was baptised by John the Baptist.Prince George leaves the Church of St Mary Magdalene for the christening of Princess Charlotte in July 2015Louis will also be expected to be christened using the ornate silver gilt Lily Font - part of the Crown Jewels.It is decorated with lilies and ivy foliage around the rim, features three cherubs around the base, and the main bowl is a large lily bloom.The Chapel Royal at St James\u0027s Palace, London, was used for Prince George\u0027s christening in 2013.Royal christenings are usually private affairs and most royal babies have been christened at royal palaces.William and the Prince of Wales were both christened in Buckingham Palace\u0027s Music Room.Princess Charlotte is pushed in her silver cross pram as she leaves the Church of St Mary Magdalene at her christeningThe Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, was christened in the Palace\u0027s private chapel in 1926.Prince Harry, now the Duke of Sussex, was christened in St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle, where he was married in May.Princess Charlotte, however, was christened at the Church of St Mary Magdalene at Sandringham in Norfolk.She was pushed to her christening past well-wishers in a vintage 1950s silver-wheeled Millson pram - once used for the Queen\u0027s youngest children Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.Prince Louis of Cambridge is 11 weeks old - here is what we know about him so far:His full name is HRH Prince Louis Arthur Charles of Cambridge.He was born on patriotic St George\u0027s Day - April 23 - at 11.01am at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital in Paddington, London.He weighed 8lb 7oz - but was not the heaviest royal baby in modern times. The Queen\u0027s first great-grandchild Savannah Phillips weighed 8lb 8oz in 2010, and the newest addition to the Windsors, Zara Tindall\u0027s daughter Lena, born last month, weighed 9lb 3oz.Louis, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s third child, is the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s sixth great-grandchild. They now have seven after the arrival of Lena Tindall.He slept well early on. Two days after Louis was born, William revealed at an Anzac Day service that the baby and Kate were in good form, luckily. Sleeping\u0027s going reasonably well so far, so he\u0027s behaving himself, which is good, he added.But it\u0027s three times as much worry for the Duke. Father of three William declared it was thrice the worry now when he left the hospital with the duchess to take newborn Louis back home to Kensington Palace.The name took people by surprise. William and Kate had already used Louis as one of Prince George\u0027s middle names, but liked it so much they decided to use it again. It has a poignant meaning for the Windsors. Louis was the name of the Prince of Wales\u0027s beloved great-uncle Earl Mountbatten, who was murdered by the IRA in 1979.Princess Charlotte is smitten with her little brother. Kensington Palace released sweet images of Charlotte cuddling baby Louis to mark her third birthday. Charlotte was pictured gently kissing the newborn on the top of his head.He is unlikely to be king. Louis is fifth in line to the throne, with the Prince of Wales, William, George and Charlotte ahead of him in the line of succession.Please review our commenting policyBoris Johnson resigns as Foreign Secretary as pressure builds on Theresa May\u0026#39s leadership - latest newsJunior doctors too overworked for essential training, report warnsIndia should repeal laws that discriminate against leprosy patients, says supreme courtRyanair strikes: When are they and which flights are affected?Who could be the next Tory leader if Theresa May is ousted?

These decentralised technologies have the potential to upend everything we thought we knew about the nature of financial systems and financial assets, said Professor William Knottenbelt from Imperial.Bitcoin price recovers from eight-month low“There’s a lot of scepticism over cryptocurrencies and how they could ever become a day-to-day payment system used by the man on the street. In this research we show that cryptocurrencies have already made significant headway towards fulfilling the criteria for becoming a widely accepted method of payment.”Should cryptocurrencies continue to progress in terms of functionality, Professor Knottenbelt\u0026nbspsaid they represent a viable technological update to the way we spend money.\u0026nbspConsidering each evolutionary iteration of money has made the process of paying for something easier, the research paper concludes that the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies make them the next natural step towards reducing the friction of payments.One possible way this could happen\u0026nbspwould be for cross-border payments, which currently involve lengthy and costly transaction times. The decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies mean they are borderless by design, and therefore negate such issues.The history of money is a history of evolution, of new technology replacing old to improve the transfer of value from one person to another. Cryptocurrencies represent a next step on this journey, said Iqbal Gandham, the UK managing director of eToro.​Given the speed of adoption, we believe that we could see Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on the high street within the decade.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMr Afwerki then travelled across the capital in a large motorcade as people wearing T-shirts with photos of the two leaders cheered. The leaders later met one-on-one, with a smiling Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspleaning towards\u0026nbspMr Afwerki under a wall hung with their portraits.The visit comes a month after Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspsurprised people by fully accepting a peace deal that ended a two-year border war between the two countries. Ethiopia and Eritrea have not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphimself fighting in a town that remains contested today, and the countries have skirmished since then in one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts.Mr Ahmed’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said on Twitter that the visit aims to “further deepen efforts to bring about lasting peace.” He shared photos of the leaders’ meeting and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas “very warmly received” by Mr Afwerki.“Our two nations share a history and bond like no other,” he said. “We can now overcome two decades of mistrust and move in a new direction.”Ethiopia’s foreign ministry called the visit “part of efforts to normalise relations with Eritrea” and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas expected to talk with Eritrea’s leadership about “how to mend fences”.One Eritrean diplomat, its ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “no leader has received such a warm welcome like today in Asmara in the history of Eritrea”.Ethiopians expressed welcome shock at the meeting, which was shown live by Ethiopia’s state TV.“Historic ... the beginning of the end. The glass ceiling has been broken,” one resident, Shewit Wudassie, wrote on Facebook. Another Facebook user, Djphat Su, wrote: “Am I dreaming or what?”The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest and most surprising reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s 42-year-old prime minister, who took office in April and quickly set off a wave of reforms, freeing journalists and opposition figures from prison, opening up the state-run economy and unblocking hundreds of websites after years of anti-government protests demanding more freedoms.World news in picturesIndonesia worker and firefighters try to extinguish a fire on fishing boats at Benoa harbour in Denpasar, on Indonesia\u0027s resort island of Bali.

Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

All French parties are entitled to money in proportion to the number of votes it receives.The party, which recently changed its name from National Front to National Rally in an attempt to distance itself from racist and antisemitic associations, has long suffered from financial problems.In 2014 it took a loan from a Russian bank, saying it had been refused credit in France.

Here are the candidates most likely to take over, with odds from Ladbrokes.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Latin-fluent millionaire financier and MP for North East Somerset, has emerged as the leading Brexiteer on the backbenches.He has also has garnered a surprise following among many young Tories - including Jungle Queen Georgia Toffolo, who called him a sex god.Devout Catholic Rees-Mogg has made no secret of his socially conservative views, including being anti-abortion and against gay marriage.His plummy tones, double-breasted suits and traditional manner have earned him the nickname The Honourable Member for the Nineteenth Century.Jeremy Corbyn has emerged as the favourite among most bookies as the nations likely next PM.The Labour leader has had to fight constant opposition from his own MPs including a leadership contest after just a year.But the party has swung behind him after a much stronger than expected 2017 general election when Labour picked up 30 seats and Mrs May lost her majority.Despite a study showed the fabled youthquake of support from younger voters did not happen, he is enjoying strong support in opinion polls.He will be hoping Tory infighting over Europe leads to another election, which he has boasted he would win.Environment secretary has achieved a remarkable turnaround since knifing Boris Johnson.His support among party members dropped through the floor and it seemed his chances were gone forever.But Mr Gove, who played a key role in the 2016 EU referendum, has rebranded himself as an ecowarrior and green campaigner as Environment Secretary.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is still a hugely popular figure among Tory grassroots and the general public.But his support among fellow MPs seems to have evaporated in the EU referendum fallout.Mr Johnson infuriated David Cameron by using his huge public profile to campaign for Leave.His own leadership bid in 2016 was scuppered by his friend Michael Gove, severely damaging his electoral brand.BoJo has repeatedly pledged his support to Mrs May but has also angered Cabinet colleagues by trying to hijack Brexit talks and demanding extra cash for the NHS.His ambitions for the top job are well known and he is a proven winner, having been elected twice as Mayor of London in a city that heavily favours Labour.Thought an unlikely candidate at the time, the Brexit campaigner reached the final two of the 2016 leadership contest.She withdrew over ill-judged remarks about Theresa Mays childlessness.She is now Leader of the House, and survived in post despite reports Mrs May was planning to cut dead wood in her January reshuffle.Mrs Leadsom had a role in the downfall of Sir Michael Fallon after she accused him of lewd sexual comments.At one time, Ms Rudd was a leading contender to replace the PM but her odds have lengthened significantly following the Windrush scandal and her resignation after misleading Parliament over immigration targets.She has returned to the backbenches after being forced to resign as Home Secretary and is likely to push for a softer Brexit along with other former Cabinet members like Nicky Morgan and Justine Greening.Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond could make a bid for Number 10 after keeping a low profile during the general election.Mr Hammond is seen by supporters as a steady hand, but critics accuse him of trying to kibosh a clean-break Brexit by steering the PM towards keeping close ties.He is seen as one of the leading campaigners for a soft Brexit which often puts him at odds with Brexiteers like Liam Fox and David Davis.Brexit Secretary David Davis had a prominent role leading Britains Brexit negotiations in Brussels but has now resigned.Last July a study found more than a fifth of Conservatives wanted him to take as PM.But the latest polls of party members shows his support has slipped behind potential rivals.Mr Davis previously stood for the party leadership in 2001 and 2005 coming fourth and second respectively.His working-class roots also distance him from the view of Tories as out-of-touch toffs.But he has also been accused of being thick and lazy and there were calls for him to be held in contempt of Parliament over non-existent impact papers.The new Brexit secretary is now in the running after taking Davis vacant spot.He played a prominent role in the Leave campaign, and previously served as a Justice minister too.Before he went into politics he was a lawyer, working on EU and World Trade Organisation Law.His appointment has been welcomed by other Leave-backing MPs.But Labour MPs have been circulating a blog-post he wrote back in 2011 where he called for an end to feminist bigotry and said that men were getting a raw deal after new equality legislation.Mrs May was humiliated when her snap election backfired last June, costing the party its Commons majority.She also endured a series of mishaps during Octobers Tory Party conference and the fallout of the Pestminster scandal.A survey of Tory members in July showed more than 70 per cent want the PM to remain in post, but that fell to just 26 per cent in February 2018.If Mrs May was to resign there would be likely be a Tory leadership campaign, with the winner crowned PM.Alternatively, Mrs May could lose a vote of confidence, leading to the government falling.In theory, the Queen could ask the Labour leader to form a minority government, but the numbers in the Commons would make it impossible for him to govern.In this scenario, there could well be a fresh General Election with both major parties trying to secure a parliamentary majority.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Signalling that the UK might stay in a Customs Union was another enormous error.Downing Street has consistently left unchallenged the scare tactics of professional Remainers — big businesses seeking ongoing EU protection, Brussels-funded think tanks and member states wanting UK cash.The Irish land border, for instance, already copes with different currencies, duties and other tax rates.Outside the Customs Union there is no need for physical hard border posts that might inflame sectarian sensitivities — as confirmed by the head of HMRC, his Irish equivalent and a study published by the European Parliament.Instead of explaining these realities, and arguing Britain’s corner, Mrs May has allowed Irish border falsehoods to warp her entire Brexit strategy.Roberto Azevedo insisted trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules was “perfectly manageable”.She has similarly failed to counter claims it would be disastrous to leave the EU with no free trade agreement, using World Trade Organisation rules instead.Again, this is nonsense. Britain already conducts most of its trade outside the EU, largely under WTO rules.“It is not the end of the world if UK-EU trade is on the basis of WTO rules”, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo told me. “It’s ­perfectly manageable.”That’s a vital insight because, unless no deal is seen as a viable option, the UK’s negotiating hand is seriously undermined — with Britain then forced to accept whatever trade deal the EU offers as March 2019 nears.The Government should have been making determined and very visible preparations for no deal.The irony is that, behind the scenes, there has been considerable work.Last week the National Audit Office concluded that an HMRC upgrade that was happening anyway means ­Britain’s customs service should be ready to cope with no deal from January 2019.Instead of pursuing such rational strategies, Mrs May now wants the UK, in effect, to stay in the Single Market for goods, while facing greater restrictions on trade in services.This is totally lopsided — Britain is far better at exporting services (we run a £14billion annual surplus with the EU) than goods (which show a £96billion EU deficit).And proposals to solve the Irish border by tracking goods and collecting the EU’s tariff revenues have already been rejected by Brussels.Mrs May should just leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, with no deal if necessary.By presenting absurd ideas, our Mad Hatter Prime Minister appears to hope her people will conclude Brexit is too hard and should be abandoned.If so, she doesn’t understand the country she purports to govern.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mass deportations of illegal immigrants? Jawohl!And don’t mention the #RefugeesWelcome hashtag.What a change of heart. Merkel’s solution to the refugee crisis of 2015 was to dismantle Germany’s borders.No elected politician in modern history has ever acted with such monumental, breath-taking arrogance.Merkel’s grandiose virtue signalling unleashed mass, mostly economic migration that continues to this day.More than a million refugees poured into Germany in 2015 alone. They were almost exclusively young men because the old, the sick and children — the most vulnerable refugees and those most deserving of a helping hand — can’t walk the length of the Balkans.Anyone who had doubts about promoting limitless uncontrolled migration was silenced by Merkel’s smug catchphrase, “Wir schaffen das!” — We can do this!But Germany, and Europe, will pay the price for Angela Merkel’s apocalyptic arrogance long after she is pushing up edelweiss.Merkel’s career is on its knees because she permanently changed Germany without ever consulting the German people to see if her policy of the unmanaged migration of one million-plus young males from a totally different culture was actually WHAT THEY WANTED.Merkel never even thought about the wishes of the German people. We hear a lot about the rise of “populism” everywhere from Trump’s America to the new, vehemently anti-EU coalition government in Italy.But there is no great mystery about the rise of anti- establishment sentiment. For decades haughty politicians have viewed their own people with unbridled, undisguised, unapologetic contempt.Now, all over the Western world, they are paying the price.Theresa May should carefully study the fall of Angela Merkel. Whatever the polls might say, few would weep to see May departing Downing Street.It seems increasingly likely, from what we’re hearing out of Chequers, that this prime minister would far prefer to cuddle up to the crumbling EU empire rather than break free and strike trade deals with the US, Australia, Canada, India and China.But if we can’t trade with the world then it is not a soft Brexit. It is no bloody Brexit at all.Her job is not to soften our departure from the EU to such a degree that it becomes meaningless.Whatever her personal preferences, Theresa May’s job, and the historic role that falls to her now, is to honour the referendum of 2016, the vote we were solemnly promised was final by our former prime minister, David Cameron.It is not complicated. Don’t do a Merkel.Theresa May has to respect democracy and the will of the British people.And if she doesn’t or she can’t, if May betrays the British people, if she castrates or buggers up Brexit, if she tells 17.4million that they are ignorant racist bigots who should never have had a vote in the first place, then we are going to need a new prime minister.In Merkel’s spectacular fall from power there is a lesson for every leader in the Western world, especially Theresa May.You are not our master. You are our servant. You do not know best. And you ignore the will of your people at your peril.THIS World Cup has been a revelation. Who knew we would still be working up a sweat long after Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Spain had flown home?Who knew that England could win a penalty shoot-out in a World Cup? Then cruise through a quarter-final?And who knew England could only ever really succeed again – and true success means having a team that we love and take pride in – if we returned to having English managers? All jaw-dropping stuff.Now Alicia Aylies – former Miss France and the girlfriend of France’s fleet-footed Kylian Mbappe – proudly poses in a zippy bralet.Seriously, who had ever heard of the zippy bralet until Russia 2018? The shocks just keep on coming.FOR two weeks every year, the British go crazy about tennis.The Australian Open, Roland-Garros in France and the US Open hardly merit a second glance from the British public but Wimbledon is an essential part of our calendar.Yet this year our attention has been distracted by another sporting event in a distant land. The men’s singles final will overlap with the World Cup Final.But quite frankly, who cares?This year we are lukewarm on Wimbledon.So you had to feel for British wildcard Katie Boulter, knocked out in the second round.There is still plenty of time for Henman Hill or Murray Mound to become Boulter’s Bulge or Katie’s Cusp.LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan is allowing a Donald Trump blimp to float above London during the President’s visit to the UK.No news yet on if Khan has plans to do anything about the gun, knife and acid epidemic on the streets of London.With well over 1,000 stabbings this year, more than fifty of them fatal, crime in London is out of control.But at least we have that Trump balloon, Sadiq.DIEGO MARADONA was pictured grinning happily in an XXL Colombia shirt before their match with England but was apoplectic in defeat.“You have to denounce this,” fumed Maradona.“As the captain of legends, I have to tell Infantino (Fifa President) this cannot be left like this.“This is a fatal mistake for the whole country.”I’m sure it all sounds much better in translation.But you get the gist – “Our headbutting boys were robbed”.Fifa hands Maradona a reported £7,000 to turn up at every match and the fat man issued a grovelling apology for criticising the ref when he reflected that seven grand might possibly slip through his cheating hands.But you can hardly blame Diego Maradona for sticking up for those grappling, nasty, spiteful, penalty-spot-scuffing Colombians.After all, Diego has done his best to single-handedly prop up one of Colombia’s major exports. And that’s nothing to sniff at.YOUNG mum Claire Morrison, 28, was mortified when her six-year-old daughter Eve took her vibrator to school for show-and-tell because Eve thought it was a particularly interesting looking pen.Some parents might prefer to keep quiet about this mishap, but Claire has gone on Facebook to tell the “hilarious” story.“She just said it was her funny pink pen,” chuckles Claire, a hairdresser from Dundee. “Then she said, ‘It must talk because it needs batteries’. So her stepdad and I laughed that off and we have safely stored it away.”It has now been shared 6,000 times.The story. Not the vibrator. Obviously. That wouldn’t be very hygienic.WE can all understand why David and Victoria Beckham would want to put on a public display of loving solidarity on their wedding anniversary.But I can’t help wondering, does Victoria really need to tell David “I love you so much” via her Instagram account and its 21.3million followers? It seems so extravagantly public.Couldn’t she just give him a card?AFTER careful consideration, MEPs in the European Parliament have voted to keep their £3,900-a-month taxpayer-funded (and tax-free) expenses a secret.Blow me down. Nobody saw that one coming.The generous expenses, known as the general expenditure allowance, or GEA, are paid as a lump sum into the MEPs salary, with no records kept, no receipts required and no questions asked. MEPs can spend it all on prostitutes and Ferrero Rocher chocolates if they want.Nobody cares.The GEA costs around £35million a year.And our corrupt continental cousins wonder why we’re leaving.DAVID Cameron received £800,000 to write his memoirs, which have been unexpectedly delayed until next year.Cameron should tell us why he made it legally binding for this country to spend £13billion a year on foreign aid, why he bombed Libya into the failed state it is today and how he blew £9million of public money on his pro-EU leaflet. And still lost!It also transpires that it was Cameron who begged Barack Obama to say, “The UK is going to be in the back of the queue,” if we dared to leave the EU.You shouldn’t be writing your memoirs, Mr Cameron.You should be writing us a letter of apology.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course, our security interests don’t begin and end at our borders, or even at the edge of Europe.Whether it’s Russia, Syria, Afghanistan or beyond, threats continue to emerge and develop around the world.After we leave the EU we will be free to pursue a truly independent foreign policy but that does not mean we will isolate ourselves from our neighbours.Under our proposals, we will continue to consult and co-operate with our EU partners on global issues.We will work with the EU on sanctions like those recently imposed on Russia, including co-ordinating them where it’s in our interests to do so.Our joint work on defence capability and space will continue. And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done. But our ambitious, effective proposal for a smooth customs arrangement and continued security co-operation is a huge step forward.It’s a good deal for Europe, and a good deal for Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we’re only at the start of what will be no doubt stormy negotiations for months to come.There remain serious questions about not just the compromise that Theresa May has forced on her Cabinet but on the final deal she plans to sign with Brussels.One, does it genuinely give us the ability to sign free trade deals across the rest of the world, strengthening our links with emerging markets and with the Commonwealth?Two, does it genuinely end freedom of movement, or does the woolly language in Downing Street’s statement still give people the chance to come here on the off-chance they might find a job?Three, can a future Government genuinely seek to diverge further away from the EU in certain areas without Brussels blowing the whole deal up, or charging us a king’s ransom to do so?If the answer to any of those is no, then the Prime Minister will never be forgiven.Not by her party and, as we report today, not by the public either.IT is astonishing that £13,000 of taxpayers’ cash has been dished out to allow a man serving life for murder to indulge his musical passions by staging a rock opera in jail.That’s money taken from the pockets of working families who have to scrimp and save because the taxman milks them at the petrol pump, the checkout till and in their paycheque.Why did the Arts Council think it appropriate to give the fruits of their labour to a monster like Graham Coutts?The law-abiding public deserve so much better.ENGLAND in a World Cup semi-final.

The shore is lined with hostile Remainers. As for the voters — the 17.4million “thick and ignorant racists” who backed Brexit in 2016 — who cares about them?Britain is now offering a peace deal to Brussels which, however we gloss it over, stinks of surrender.To quote Boris Johnson, who backed it: “You can’t polish a turd.”This is not a White Paper. It is a White Flag.We will have a “Common Rule Book” — written by the EU and imposed by the European Court of Justice.These rules will torpedo any trade deal outside the EU. Immigration continues under a scheme which by any other name means free movement.This is not even Brexit In Name Only. It is zombie EU membership — and the UK is the zombie with no say in rule-making and paying through the nose for rule-taking.Of course, we need to be realistic. Compromises are inevitable since we made no plans for No Deal.Thanks to Mrs May’s election horror, the sums do not add up for Brexit. Remainers rule in the Tory Party, the House of Commons and the Lords.Without a heavyweight leader, Brexit Tories know they cannot raise the numbers to oust Mrs May. A failed challenge would only boost her new-found confidence and authority.Michael Gove and others argue a future Brexit Prime Minister — Mr Gove, for instance — could finish the job once we are legally Out.In fact, Britain tends to keep its treaty ­promises.We can’t even count on EU bully Michel Barnier to stir up a revolt. He and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will probably accept Mrs May’s deal, with a few tweaks, because they are effectively its co-authors.The Rule Book will keep us in line — no ­separate trade deals, no sovereign control over our borders, no escaping the ECJ.Brexit Cabinet ministers must accept some of the blame. They failed to force Mrs May when they had a chance to prepare for a No Deal Brexit. That failure instantly handed victory to the Remainers and to Brussels.Should we one day choose to make a clean break, we will face harsh “consequences” — what Boris vividly calls “punishment beatings”.But the biggest punishment beating will come from voters.If the Tories don’t care about the 17.4million who want Brexit, they will be made to care.Constitutional lawyer Martin Howe, a Tory QC, warns we are entering “a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit where Britain is stuck ­permanently as a vassal state.”The fragile Tory lead over Labour has just evaporated. Almost 40 per cent of voters think the PM has betrayed the 2016 referendum result.Tories might not switch directly to Labour, but they won’t forget. If only a small percentage sit out the next Election, Jezza will be our first Marxist PM.Michael Gove and Home Secretary Sajid Javid tried to put a shine on a deal they claim is the “best available”.And they didn’t even have the decency to hold their noses.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of which minister Davis was here for four this year.His role has always been more defined in London. So that’s where they will have to look at the consequences. On this end we will just negotiate with whomever the UK government sends here to do so.Others have taken aim at Mr Davis for choosing to step away from the talks at such a crucial moment, with another EU diplomat saying: The resignation will be framed as not taking responsibility for a soft Brexit but looks more like not taking responsibility at all.“It is starting to look like the flight of the Brexiteers.With suggestions other leading Eurosceptics in the Government could resign too, another diplomat said: They [Brexiteers] landed your country in a mess and now they’re leaving for higher ground.Rats and sinking ships, that age old tale.But the EU Commission officially said it had no specific comment to make on Mr Daviss resignation, adding: Well continue to negotiate in good faith with PM May and the UK government.”Mr Davis resigned saying the PM was pursuing a dangerous strategy he could no longer support, after she finally got her Cabinet to sign off on a basis for talks with the EU.But Mrs May faces a further headache after the Irish deputy PM says the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier will find it “difficult” to accept the proposal agreed at Chequers on Friday.This is because it will keep the UK tied to the EU’s rules but only on goods and agricultural products – and Mrs May has repeatedly been warned this approach is “cherry-picking” and will not be approved.Mr Barnier said the discussions at Chequers, the PM’s country estate – are “to be welcomed”, but said he said needed to asses if they are “workable and realistic” ahead of discussions on July 16.But he said he needed to see the full proposals in the Government’s long-await White Paper – expected this week. .This was echoed by others in Brussels, with one diplomatic source telling the Daily Mail: “It’s about the White Paper at the moment. It’s important to wait for that detail. We can’t be sure about anything until we see it.“But what is being said about goods still has a ‘have cake and eat it’ feeling. That will be the sticking point.“The way it’s seen in relation to the single market is, you don’t just swallow one bit, you swallow all of it.”And Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy PM and minister for foreign affairs, said: “The EU has never been keen to facilitate a breaking up of an approach toward the single market in terms of keeping all of the elements of the single market intact and consistent, so I think Britain will find it difficult to persuade the EU to support the approach they’re now proposing.“Michel Barnier will be a very, very strong defender of the EU interests here, in terms of protecting the integrity of the single market and the integrity of the EU customs union.”And another diplomatic source was scathing of the plan, telling The Observer: “A goulash gets better the more it is recooked.“I am not sure about whether the customs proposals share the same quality.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For a few hours the Prime Minister was being praised for holding her Cabinet together after last Friday’s Chequers summit.   Then David Davis resigned .   The Brexit Secretary’s departure raises two questions: one is about the survival of the Prime Minister and the other is about the survival of Brexit.   If his resignation prompts further Cabinet ministers to quit then Mrs May\u0027s position becomes increasingly perilous.   At the moment most of the Brexiteers (Michael Gove, Chris Grayling, Andrea Leadsom, Liam Fox, Penny Mordaunt etc) appear signed up to the Prime Minister’s plans.        The one exception is Boris Johnson who will make his decision based entirely on whether it will further his ambitions to be Prime Minister.   Davis, of course, will now be in the position to return to his traditional role as a backbench troublemaker but his spell in government has left him more buckled and less swash .   In his interview on the Today programme this morning Davis made clear he would be campaigning to prevent any further concessions to Brussels.   In many ways the more damaging resignation was that of his junior minister Steve Baker.   Baker is a Brexiteer ideologue who has shown in the past he has the drive and organisational skills to marshall discontented Tory eurosceptics.   All of this will make for an uncomfortable meeting when Mrs May addresses the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers this evening.   Some may be emboldened by Davis’s resignation to push for a leadership challenge .   But to what end?      The Brexiteers could topple Mrs May and try to replace with one of their own but it would change neither the fundamentals – a soft Brexit is the only one on the table – nor the maths – there is no Commons majority for a hard Brexit.   Davis’s resignation letter is incendiary because he is fundamentally right about what he says is Mrs May\u0027s dangerous direction of travel.   Mrs May’s offer will almost inevitably lead to the softest of all Brexits and, as Davis notes, it is looking less and less likely we will leave the customs union and the single market.   As the Brexiteer who was in charge of the negotiations Davis must be furious with himself.   His departure is the equivalent of spelling out in neon lights that the whole sorry project has been a failure.    Those who led the campaign to leave did so on the flimsiest and most speculative of prospectuses.   The only way their vision of Brexit can be achieved is for the UK to abandon decades of accumulated rights and protections which, funnily enough, voters tend to prize quite highly.   Mrs May now has to sell her damaged proposals to recalcitrant MPs and to a bemused Brussels.   It is not certain the PM has ever had an overall strategy for delivering Brexit but her modus operandi appears to be nudge her party one step at a time towards the softest of landings.   So far she has got them to swallow the divorce bill, then the transition period, then the Northern Ireland backstop and now full alignment with EU rules and regulations and the oversight of the European Court of Justice.   And in the process she is revealing that the best path for the UK is to work so closely with the EU and so entwine our economies and laws many will wonder why we don’t go the whole hog and remain full members.    When you are running a government which sees a Cabinet minister resign once every six weeks on average then you may conclude things are not going well.   Though Labour should be concerned that the calamitous state of the Government has not yet translated into a surge of support for Her Majesty\u0027s opposition.   As if Mrs May did not have enough on her plate, a British national now appears to have been murdered on UK soil.   Expect a statement to MPs later on the death of Dawn Sturgess who has died after coming into contact with Russian-manufacture Novichok.       Today’s agenda:   2.30pm – Gavin Williamson takes defence questions in the Commons.   3pm – Officials from the DWP are grilled by the Public Accounts committee on the universal credit.   4pm – James Brokenshire is quizzed by the Housing, Communities and Local government committee.   4pm - David Davis is interviewed on Iain Dale’s LBC show.   6pm (approx) – Theresa May addresses the 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs.

The Cabinet Minister, appointed by Prime Minister Theresa May to handle Brexit after the resignation of David Davis, is a long-term supporter of leaving the EU to cut regulations protecting employees.  Both Labour and the Trade Unions have expressed concerns about his appointment. He is the co-author of the hard-right \u0027Britannia Unchained\u0027 manifesto in 2012. Britannia Unchained was written by Kwasi Kwarteng MP, Priti Patel MP, Dominic Raab MP, Chris Skidmore MP and Liz Truss MP.  The book claimed British workers ‘prefer a lie-in to hard work’ and that British people ‘are amongst the worst idlers in the world’. This follows Raab\u0027s proposals in a pamphlet published by the Centre for Policy Studies in 2011 entitled \u0027Escaping the Strait Jacket\u0027.  In it he argues that should the UK leave the EU this should be seen as an opportunity to slash protections for workers. Referring to David Cameron\u0027s attempts renegotiate Britain\u0027s relationship with the EU, Mr Raab wrote: “This opportunity should be seized, and used to remove some of the obstacles to British business.”  He writes: cutting the cost of EU social regulations by 50% could result in a boost to economic output equivalent to the creation of 140,000 new jobs in the UK. Raab\u0027s pamphlet includes proposals to: -Abolish the minimum wage for workers aged under 21 working in small businesses -Abolish the working time directive which protects workers from having to work unfair hours -Scrap employment rights for agency workers’ rights and conditions -End transfer of undertakings (tupe) regulations protecting workers when their job is transferred to a new employer -Ensure workers employed by small businesses don\u0027t benefit from flexible working rights or pension auto-enrolment Paul Blomfield, Labour’s Shadow Brexit Minister, said: “The new Brexit Secretary has long harboured ambitions to slash vital workplace protections and rights, and the Prime Minister has now put him in a position to do so. “This latest blow for workers comes a few days after the Cabinet failed to rule out a race to the bottom with the EU on crucial employment protection. It’s become abundantly clear once again that this chaotic Tory Government cannot be trusted with people’s rights after Brexit.”  Tim Roache, GMB General Secretary said:  “This appointment signals a promotion of a hard right figurehead who has shown contempt for working people in Britain.   “Theresa May has appointed someone who think British workers are lazy and have too many rights and he has already published plans to slash vital rights from the minimum wage to rights for agency workers.

The Prime Minister has been severely weakened after losing David Davis and then Boris Johnson after both Brexiteers revealed they could not support her customs compromise deal hammered out at Chequers on Friday. A leadership challenge can be triggered if 15 percent of members of parliament in May\u0027s Conservative Party write a letter to the chairman of the party\u0027s so-called 1922 committee. The Conservatives currently have 316 members of parliament (MPs) so 48 of them would need to write such letters to challenge May. Once that threshold has been reached, the chairman will announce the start of the contest and invite nominations. If several names are put forward to lead the party, then a vote is held among Conservative MPs using the first past the post system to whittle down the field with the candidate with the fewest votes removed.  Another ballot among Conservative MPs is then held until two candidates remain. The final two nominees are then put to a ballot of the wider Conservative Party membership with the winner named the new leader. Jacob Rees Mogg  The hardcore Brexiteer, who is often referred to as the honorable member for the 18th century, is incredibly popular with the Tory membership who are crucial for any leadership hopeful. Mr Rees-Mogg is very firmly on the backbenches so becoming leader would be a big leap. The Catholic MP opposes abortion in any circumstances and same sex marriage. His election as Tory leader would represent a serious step backwards for those who have tried to remake the party for the 21st century.   Andrea Leadsom stood for the leadership against Theresa May but was forced to drop out after she implied she had a greater stake in society than the now PM because she had children.  However Mrs Leadsom, who is on the right of the party and pro-Brexit, has since then become a loyal member of Mrs May\u0027s team. She has also shown herself to be a strong voice standing up for the victims of bullying of staff in Westminster and especially in supporting women in politics. Michael Gove  The Environment Secretary showed he had the ruthlessness to do whatever it takes to get power when he knifed Boris Johnson in the back by standing against him during the Tory leadership contest following David Cameron\u0027s resignation. He\u0027s shown himself to be a canny operator by taking his Environment brief and making it part of the national conversation with moves to ban plastic straws cutting through in the world beyond Westminster.  Mr Gove has also shown he is loyal by backing the PM\u0027s Brexit customs plan on Friday and taking to the TV studios on Sunday to defend it.   The former Foreign Secretary has always been popular with grassroots Tories but in recent years his star has seemed to wane as his comical gaffes seemed less funny when played out on the world stage. He was completely wrong-footed when his former ally Michael Gove stood against him in the contest to take over from David Cameron. It also took him more than 15 hours to decide to quit his post after David Davis had done what he saw as the honorable thing. Boris\u0027s dithering in this, as on the issue whether or not to support Brexit in the first place, is not a good quality for a possible leader or Prime Minister. Jeremy Hunt  The UK\u0027s longest serving Health Secretary has shown he has incredible sticking power in a tough role. He has been loyal to the Prime Minister and has shown he can handle a crisis. Despite supporting Remain in the run-up to the referendum he has consistently backed Brexit since the result. But it\u0027s unclear whether he has the support from ordinary Tory members. Sajid Javid  According to a YouGov poll the Home Secretary is currently the most popular cabinet minister among Tory party members. Mr Javid, who has also served as housing secretary and within the business department, campaigned to stay in the EU but since the vote he has argued in favour of leaving.  Since his appointment following Amber Rudd\u0027s resignation he has had to hit the ground running to deal with issues including the Windrush scandal and the Salisbury attack.  He is seen as a competent political performer. David Gauke  The chaos of the last few weeks may cause for a steady hand. Justice Secretary David Gauke has shown he can get on with the job especially when faced with the difficult job as the Work and Pensions Secretary. He is a bit of an outside bet as he has very little name recognition beyond Westminster. But there is precedent for such a boring candidate winning the top job just as John Major did when Margaret Thatcher lost a vote of no confidence. Gavin Williamson  The Defence Secretary landed his huge promotion after proving his loyalty to Theresa May, helping her secure the leadership and get key votes through the Commons as her chief whip. His knowledge and understanding of Tory MPs in that role was second to none. However, since he\u0027s been in the defence job there\u0027s been little sign of that loyalty with well publicised calls for extra funding for the Armed Forces and clashing with the Treasury. He\u0027s been mocked as Private Pike and widely criticised for his undignified approach to diplomacy including telling Russia to shut up and go away. Despite his campaigning for more defence spending he has managed to upset fellow MPs and it is unclear how much support he would have in the wider party.

The Prime Minister promoted Dominic Raab to be Brexit Secretary after he spent just six months in the job. The vacancy means the government is having to find its third housing minister since the Grenfell Tower disaster only 13 months ago. Mr Raab\u0027s replacement will be fifth person to hold the role since 2015 and the eighth since 2010. Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey slammed Tory ministers. He said: Dominic Raab\u0027s move means that Theresa May is on her fourth housing minister in just two years as Prime Minister.  There have been eight different housing ministers in the last eight years. This is no way to run a Government.” Alexandra Morris, managing director of online letting agent MakeUrMove, said: “It is hugely disappointing that the housing brief is once again the poor relation. We’re staring down the barrel of a very real housing crisis. The Government needs to make housing a priority, and this starts with appointing an expert on housing with a firm commitment to the role. Trussle mortgage broker founder Ishaan Malhi added: We desperately need not only innovation, but continuity of leadership and a strong hand willing to be brave on policy. “I only hope the new Housing Minister can stay in the job long enough to have an impact.”  Mrs May declared it was her personal mission to fix the housing crisis and pledged to build 300,000 homes a year overall by the mid-2020s. But just 39,350 homes started being built in the three months to March - a fall of 8% on a year earlier. It also emerged just two new council homes were started every day, while the number of housing association homes started between fell 14% to 5,230.  Earlier this year the Tory government quietly dropped its key pledge to \u0027fix the broken housing market\u0027 from official plans. Used by Tory ministers since at least 2016, \u0027Fixing our broken housing market\u0027 was the title of a government White Paper in February last year. The 2017 Tory manifesto also vowed to fix the dysfunctional housing market before the Prime Minister used the phrase in her October conference speech.

Year nine pupil Blake Fradley claims he was sent home by King Edward VI Sheldon Heath Academy, in Sheldon, Birmingham after explaining it was too hot to wear the jacket.  The 13-year-old\u0027s family said Blake was ordered not to return to school for a full week, BirminghamLive reports.  Now mum Lisa has spoken out - urging the school to reconsider their strict \u0027full uniform\u0027 policy during the blazing summer temperatures.  She explained how she had received a call from her son telling her staff had ordered him to wear his blazer.   He then added that he had been excluded for five days following the dispute.   He called me and said he had been excluded - I panicked and my mind was racing wondering what he had done, mum-of-three Lisa said. When he told me it was over a blazer I was stunned. He had been walking back into his form class when he was pulled aside by a teacher who ordered him to put his blazer back on, but he refused. He said it was ridiculously hot. Staff took the decision to exclude him for the next five days.      Blake will now be off school and staying at home until Friday, July 13 following the row. And as a result he has reportedly missed a Spanish exam.   His mum explained: He\u0027s really unhappy as he had a Spanish speaking exam which decides their sets for next year - he had been revising for it however as he\u0027s not there he hasn\u0027t been able to take the exam.   He\u0027s just been moping around the house since.  He is due to go on a school camping trip in the next few weeks. I now have no idea if this will go ahead the Sheldon mum added.

Linda Martin\u0027s daughter Maryanne Pilling, now 47, married the love of her life Tommy Pilling, who also has Down\u0027s syndrome, in July 1995. Nearly a quarter of a century on, the couple remain happily married, sharing kisses and cuddles and making incredible memories every day. But sadly, in recent years, Tommy, 60, has been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u0027s disease - and continues to display early signs of it. He is getting more forgetful, while it is becoming harder for him to speak and be understood by those who aren\u0027t close to him.  His mum-in-law Linda explained what she and other loved ones have told Maryanne about his condition and what will happen in the future. At the moment, we just say that Tommy is getting older and he forgets things, and he needs a bit more care, she said in a new podcast. And that is enough for Maryanne to deal with at the moment. We go on a day -to-day basis. So at this moment, baby steps, she added.  Linda spoke out about her daughter and son-in-law on Jo Piazza\u0027s Committed Podcast as they prepare to celebrate 23 years of marriage.  The couple tied the knot in a beautiful ceremony at a church in Shoeburyness, Essex, with Maryanne dressed in a Cinderella-style gown. More than two decades on, Maryanne, who lives with Tommy in Southend-on-Sea, tells her husband she loves him three times a day.  And whenever she speaks of him to others, her face lights up. As well as sharing tender embraces, the inspirational couple also go out to concerts, play football, laugh with loved ones and cook together. However, recently, Tommy has been getting more and more forgetful. Speaking in the podcast, host Jo mentioned his early signs of Alzheimer\u0027s and asked Linda whether she had spoken with her daughter about what happens when Tommy\u0027s gone. The mum, who also lives in Southend-on-Sea, replied: No, because I have to be very careful how I deal with things like that with Maryanne. Because when she was 12 her brother was killed and I have to be very careful how I approach things as far as that is concerned.  Maryanne and Tommy\u0027s love has defied both the odds and critics. While some have called Linda a \u0027bad mother\u0027 for allowing her daughter to get married, others have deemed the couple\u0027s love disgusting. But as far as Linda is concerned, the fact her daughter has found somebody to love is the best thing she could have ever wished for. She said: I wish I could have found a love like it in my life - because it\u0027s very honest, it\u0027s very true and it really is a beautiful thing. Maryanne and Tommy\u0027s fairytale relationship began 28 years ago. The couple, who share a passion for cooking, met through fate in 1990 while working in a local training centre for people with disabilities. At the time, Maryanne was 19 - 13 years younger than Tommy. But from the moment they met, they shared an incredible connection.  When asked what she thought of her first encounter with her future husband, Maryanne told Jo: That I love him. Just true love. It wasn\u0027t long after that Maryanne brought Tommy home to meet her family. She giggled happily as she proudly introduced him. Although Tommy was fairly quiet, Maryanne soon brought him out of his shell. And a year after they met, things became very serious. Deciding he wished to propose to his beloved girlfriend, a besotted Tommy bought a plastic ring for her from a vending machine. He then gave it to Maryanne, who was elated. She excitedly showed her mum the ring, saying Tommy wants us to get engaged. Linda, who admitted her first thought was good God, sat down with her daughter and Tommy and asked them what they wanted. In response, the couple said they wished to marry each other.  Linda then took the pair to get a proper ring and for the next four years, they remained engaged, getting to know each other properly. In mid-July 1995, they finally tied the knot in a perfect\u0027 ceremony, surrounded by hundreds of family and friends, and so much love. Linda said her daughter looked stunning in her white dress, tiara and long veil, while Tommy donned a made-to-measure suit. For their honeymoon, the couple stayed in a seafront hotel, according to the podcast, \u0027Love Me Tender\u0027, which was released last week. Afterwards, Tommy moved into Maryanne’s family home. However, amid the post-wedding bliss, Linda received cruel messages telling her that she shouldn\u0027t have allowed her daughter to get married. But she told Jo: For me as a mother, I would have felt I\u0027d failed her if I hadn\u0027t acknowledged the fact that she was in love with somebody.  Maryanne and Tommy later moved into their own flat. Today, they continue to live independently there, next door to both of their mums and across the road from Maryanne\u0027s sister, Lindi. And despite needing assistance from their loved ones with most aspects of their life, including cooking and washing, they manage superbly. They go out on dates and day trips and, recently, Tommy celebrated his 60th birthday with a huge party. As always, his wife was by his side. Pictures of the happy pair - who were thought to be the first couple with Down\u0027s syndrome to wed in 1995 - are regularly posted online.  A Facebook page, set up by Lindi, follows Maryanne and Tommy\u0027s romance and has amassed more than 40,000 followers.   A post on the \u0027Maryanne and Tommy\u0027 page reveals that the couple renewed their wedding vows 13 years ago - then again three years ago. It adds: They have now been together for 28 years, since Maryanne was 19 years of age. Tommy is 13 years older than Maryanne and he recently celebrated turning 60! On World Down Syndrome day too! Their marriage is like a fairytale and they are the most blissfully happy couple that I know. I think most of us could learn a thing or two from them! When they got engaged 25 years ago many many people doubted them, said it was disgusting and they shouldn’t be allowed to get married, they also said that it would never work. But I like to say they are still as happy as they were 28 years ago when they first met. This page shows their love for one another quite clearly, it shows how happy they are, how much they adore each other and it proves to all the doubters that anything is possible with love.

The long-standing dilemma of how to tell whether you are out for a few drinks or out for the night was famously brought to the fore by comedian Micky Flanagan. Now a team of researchers have settled the dispute by revealing going ‘out-out’ means clearing your diary for the following day, going to a nightclub and staying out later than planned. Dodging a curfew set by your other half, know you\u0027ll need a lie in in the morning and can envision scoffing a kebab on the way, are also signs it\u0027s a big night out.  The study of 2,000 adults also found if you’re spending the evening with four of your closest friends and take around 39 minutes to get ready, then you will definitely be painting the town red. The research was commissioned by Malibu rum in celebration of National Pina Colada day, which takes place tomorrow. Jennie Bosson of Malibu said: “It was really interesting to see the different rituals people have, in order to make the most of their nights out. \u0027“Our research showed Brits love to socialise and go out, but modern life means we can’t always make the time for it.\u0027\u0027 It also emerged among the signs you’re going ‘out out’ are spending more money, having a quick power nap and using that special scent of aftershave or perfume. Nearly one in four agreed if you know you’re not getting the last train or bus home, then you’re definitely \u0027out-out\u0027.  Starting the night at 7:19pm at a friend’s house, followed by visiting three bars to indulge in Pina Coladas and Mojitos also make up a proper night out over a trip to the pub. Spending an average of \u0026pound68.82, after chatting to four people and wrapping up the night at 1.56am were also found to be signs of a night ‘out out’. Others said wearing ‘killer heels’ or shoes instead of trainers were also among the key indicators. The study also found Saturday is still the best night of the week to get dolled up and go out with friends, closely followed by a Friday night.  Nearly half of Brits would opt for a night ‘out out’ over a casual social gathering at the local pub, with more than a third in agreement they would rather dance the night away with pals of the same gender. The study found more than half agreed a night on the tiles it gives them a chance to have fun and three in 10 said it allows them to relax. Forty-five per cent said a night ‘out out’ allows them to catch up with friends, with once fifth saying it gives them a break from modern life. And more than a quarter found it gives them a chance to meet new people. Allowing themselves just one night a month to truly let their hair down, 38 per cent wished they went on ‘big nights out’ with friends more often. But half agreed busy schedules prevent Brits from enjoying themselves more often, with a surprising 57 per cent saying we are a nation who’d rather stay in. Forty-five per cent put it down to a lack of time, with more than seven in 10 saying Brits can’t afford it and nearly a third said friends are always the busy ones. Bosson added: \u0027\u0027It was great to see Pi\u0026ntildea Colada is in the top two of the nation’s favourite drinks when ‘out out’ especially in time for National Pi\u0026ntildea Colada Day. “We find that Malibu drinkers are the ultimate social butterflies and more likely to opt for a night ‘out out’ on the town than most.

It was based on Queen Victoria\u0027s own wedding dress, and was made of Spitalfields silk and Honiton lace. The original was worn by 62 royal babies, including then-Princess Elizabeth - now the Queen - for her christening at Buckingham Palace in 1926.

But as nice as it is to have stolen the Australian summer, us Brits just aren\u0027t used to coping with sudden rises in temperature. Still, all it really takes is a bit of preparation. Here are our tips for keeping comfortable and safe in this glorious weather. Now get out there and enjoy! Hydrate early, hydrate often    Your body is two-thirds water and you need to keep it topped up. If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll get headaches and may also be more tired than usual. Hydration is, as most things are, even more important for little ones. According to the British Nutrition Foundation children are less heat tolerant than adults and have a higher percentage of water in their bodies. They\u0027re also tricky little monkeys who rarely remember to drink unless reminded. The key then, is going to be making it fun to grab a drink. If you have an outdoor power socket in your garden then connect up the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) and fill it with drinks. That way your kids can get their own chilled drink - they\u0027ll love this. You can just as easily put the coolbox inside if you don\u0027t have an outdoor power outlet. Alternatively, if you If you are planning to be out and about, you can also charge the cooler from your car\u0027s 12v power outlet. Make staying hydrated even more fun for the kids with a set of plastic Rainbow Tumblers, \u0026pound3 (half price).  Be skin-savvy Being outside in the sunshine is enjoyable, but its UV rays can do lasting damage to your skin. Applying a high SPF sun cream is vital - but it\u0027s also best to avoid exposing your skin to direct sun for prolonged periods, especially between midday and 3pm, when the sun is strongest. This is especially important for kids. So with a cloudless, beautiful summer sky you\u0027re going to need to create some shade. If you\u0027re at the beach, then a dedicated shelter will help. Halfords\u0027 Beach Shelter offers a 30+ UV protection. If you\u0027re spending most of the day out in the garden and the kids are in and out of the paddling pool, you may need more protection. The Halfords 300 Gazebo costs just \u0026pound69 ( was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21) and has a UV 50+ rating.  When choosing a gazebo or shelter for the sunny weather it\u0027s worth understanding those UV protection numbers. With a 50+ rating the gazebo should stop around 97 to 98 per cent of the UV radiation from the sun. This, combined with sun cream will help keep you all much safer. With any gazebo you might also want to consider some weights to go along with it. Just because it\u0027s sunny, doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t also be a bit blowy out! Baby, it\u0027s hot outside The hot weather can feel uncomfortable for adults, but it\u0027s particularly important to keep babies in the shade - as they are less able to sweat to cool down and their skin is very sensitive. So it\u0027s worth investing in a stroller or pram with a decent sun visor if you are taking your little one out and about in the sun.  The Joie Mirus Scenic Stroller, \u0026pound120, is an affordable modern stroller which comes with a SPF 50+ sun canopy. (It can also be paired with either the Joie Gemm or Joie Juva Infant Car Seat, to create a travel system, with no adapter needed.)  For playing in the garden or trips to the beach, grab the Halfords Infant Playshade, \u0026pound25. It pops up and down in less than 10 seconds and is made from specially tested material that provides a 50+ UV protection factor. Stay cool in the car  It\u0027s fair to say we love most things about summer, but getting into a hot car on a sweltering day isn\u0027t one of them. Did you know your air conditioning loses charge every year, making it less efficient and making your car warmer? Halfords now offers a FREE Air Con Check, to check your refrigerant levels and see if they need to be topped up for optimal performance. If they do need topping up, you can purchase air con essentials from store to recharge at home or, you can book in for an air con recharge service and Halfords can take care of it for you. You can also keep out the worst of the heat by investing in a windscreen shield to reflect the sun\u0027s glare. The Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield is just \u0026pound7.99 - and when winter eventually does roll around, you can also use it to protect against the build up of snow and frost.

The heatwave is no fun for anyone, but there are a few things you can do to at least cool down your home. There\u0027s nothing worse than trying to nod off in your room, or trying to relax, while feeling like you\u0027re in the seventh circle of hell. Being in the midst of a heatwave is not as fun as it first sounds, especially without air con, but there are some things you can do to cool down your home and finally get some shut eye. Before we get to how to use a freezer to your advantage (not sticking your head in it) and getting as low as you can (no this isn\u0027t limbo), we have to acknowledge the quickest way is to get air con. Of course, the bad thing about getting air con is the cost - upfront and then running it - so here are a few quick tips and tricks to drop your home\u0027s temperature without spending too much.  Keep away from the satin and silk and opt for the cooler linen and cotton sheets. Light-coloured bed linen made of light fabrics (take Egyptian cotton for example) are breathable so better to sleep in. The Egyptians had it right, in fact, they even had their own method for keeping cool. Known as The Egyptian Method (original, we know) they\u0027d dampen a towel or sheet in cool water and use it as a blanket. It may be a good idea to lay the damp sheet on top of a towel first, no one likes a wet bed. 2. Freezer tricks Speaking of sheets, you can stick them in the freezer for a few minutes before you\u0027re about to go to sleep. No, we haven\u0027t lost our minds, just make sure you put them in something like a plastic bag before you pop them in. You don\u0027t want your sheets smelling of pizza and ice cream. The trick won\u0027t last all night but it will give you a breather so you can get to sleep. 3. Don\u0027t cook a roast  ...or any hot meal. Summer is never the time to be whipping up a casserole or hot meal. Put the slow cooker away, step away from the stove and have a salad. 4. Use that hot water bottle Buy yourself a hot water bottle. While we\u0027re used to filling them with hot water in the winter to keep toasty, in the summer sticking it in the freezer instead creates a lovely ice pack. 5. Turn your fan around Fans are great in the mild heat, but when it\u0027s cranked up they just blow hot air around so it\u0027s all about strategic placement. If you point them outside, slightly towards the windows, they push out the hot air. If you have a ceiling fan set them counter-clockwise to pull the hot air away. 6. Ice fan  We\u0027ve already mentioned fans, but there\u0027s so much more to be said. At school we used to use those little iceboxes to keep our food cool, so this idea comes from that. It\u0027s sort of a DIY aircon system. Use a roasting pan, or box and fill it with ice and put it in front of a fan. When the ice melts the breeze from the fan picks up the cool air coming from the ice\u0027s surface, creating a nice cool mist. 7. Cross breeze More of the fan tricks. Strategically place numerous fans around a room. Put a fan by the window, and then another further inside the room so they both push the cooler air around the room. 8. How low can you go Hot air rises so sleeping in a room on the ground floor means you\u0027ll feel cooler. If you\u0027re in a one-storey flat you can move your sheet to the ground to make life easier. 9. Don\u0027t get steamy  We imagine you\u0027re continually hopping in the shower to cool down, just make sure the water is tepid rather than warm/hot. Steam hangs about and makes a room that much hotter. 10. No lights This should make sense. Light bulbs - even if they\u0027re environmentally friendly - give off heat, so switch them off. The sun shines for longer now anyway so keeping the lights off not only saves on your energy bill, but cuts down on the extra heat. 11. Hang a wet sheet Yes, you read that right. Hanging a wet sheet in front of an open window will help bring down the room\u0027s temperature. 12. No electronic devices  The same applies here as the lights. Unplug your phone and devices, do not charge them when you are asleep. Everything radiates heat and you don\u0027t need that when you\u0027re trying to catch some zzzs. 13. Use grains Buckwheat pillows don\u0027t absorb heat like cotton does so getting one is a good investment for summer. 14. Closing curtains  In the daytime. If you think about when the sun is at its hottest those rays are coming through the window hotting everything up. Close the curtains and your room is instantly cooler.  15. Use your garden  If you plant the right trees and shrubs around the house they will provide you with much needed shade. Vines work well too. Of course that won\u0027t work for this summer, but next year you\u0027ll be thanking us. 16. Paint it white  Again, maybe one for next year, but painting your house white helps. The white colour reflects the light, cooling the house down. 17. Insulate  Long-term thinking again. When you think of insulation you probably think of keeping warm, but it can work the other way too. Good insulation keeps the heat out as well once the room is cooled down.

Luckily for Paige, her three-year-old son Preston was sleeping inside at the time and not playing in the garden. But she says that despite her ordeal, Asda have refused to give her a refund. In her Facebook post she wrote: Warning to anyone who owns a Miami table set from Asda. Today mine has got so hot it\u0027s exploded leaving glass all over my garden.   She said Asda told her she would not get a refund because she had no receipt or packaging. This is not the first time that the specific piece of furniture has been at the centre of complaints.  A wave of reports surfaced in 2015 of glass tables spontaneously shattering for no apparent reason .  On that occasion, Barry Williams, from Drayton in Portsmouth, demanded Asda recall their \u0027Miami eight piece patio set\u0027. Responding to Paige\u0027s post, Sharon Drake commented: That\u0027s actually shocking. Me and your mum were sitting there yesterday! That\u0027s so bad thank god everyone\u0027s ok though.   Paige said: When I called them initially they didn\u0027t seem that interested, they told me, \u0027You won\u0027t be getting a refund\u0027. I was shocked that they didn\u0027t at least apologise and didn\u0027t want to recall the tables. Asda say they are aware of the issue and have been in contact with Paige.

Horrigan, of West Mersea, who turns 92 this week was recorded with 47 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath – over the legal limit of 35.  Prosecutor Danielle Jones told the court Horrigan complied with police after she was arrested. She said: “At quarter past eight in the evening on Sunday, June 3 the defendant drove her grey Audi along Abbots Road, Colchester, where it is said she lost control and collided with the central reservation island causing her vehicle damage and damage to the street furniture. “Police arrived and the road side test was complied with and came back as positive, the defendant was arrested and taken to Colchester Police Station. “She gave two samples of breath both being 47 in 100ml of breath.” Graham Brown, defending, passed a letter to the bench and said his client deeply regretted the crash and will not apply for her licence when her disqualification expires.

But it seems Prince Harry managed to come up with an incredibly sweet idea for his new nephew Louis - but it came with a staggering \u0026pound8,000 price tag. He bought his second nephew a first edition of AA Milne\u0027s Winnie-The-Pooh to mark the special day. Despite the jaw-dropping price, there\u0027s actually an extremely special story behind the expensive gift, and it\u0027s a touching tribute to William and Harry\u0027s late mum Diana.  According to Harry\u0027s close friends, the new Duke of Sussex plans to start a library for little Louis.  The source told the Sun : One of Harry’s happiest childhood memories was being read a bedtime story by his mother.  She loved all the old classics and Harry had the brilliant idea of starting a little library of first editions for Louis, Charlotte and George to enjoy as they get older. He originally wanted to get Lewis Carroll’s Through The Looking Glass, which was on sale for \u0026pound24,000, but decided Winnie-The-Pooh would be more suitable for a first tome.  The book reportedly dates back to 1926 and is one of 30,000 printed in the first run. Prince Louis will be christened in the Chapel Royal at St James\u0027s Palace in a service led by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby. It will be a small event attended by just his closest family and new godparents, however the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh will not attend.

Despite the little royal being the fifth in the line to the throne, it\u0027s likely to be a quiet affair with just close family and friends invited. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will lead the service at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace. It\u0027s the same place where Louis\u0027 big brother George was christened back in 2013, while Princess Charlotte had her service at the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Norfolk in 2015. But even though it will be a small and private event, it is royal after all so there are of course some special and rather odd traditions Kate and Wills must stick to.  Lily font  Kate and Wills will be brining one very special item to the church for the special day - the Lily Font .  The royal family\u0027s special font, which has been used for every christening since 1841, is made from silver gilt and decorated with flowers, ivy and cherubs. It also features the royal arms of Queen Victoria and the joint royal arms of Victoria and Prince Albert - Prince Louis\u0027 great-great-great-great-great-grandparents, who were married in the Chapel Royal in 1840.   The 17inch tall font is gilded in silver and is believed to cost \u0026pound11,000, reports the Sun .  However, experts believe it if was sold at auction today it would sell for a lot more. The receipt at the time, dated, February 8, 1841, lists the price as \u0026pound189 9s. The font was commissioned for Princess Victoria\u0027s christening more than 170 years ago. When it\u0027s not being used the font is kept locked away with all of the rest of the royal family\u0027s most valuable possessions.  You can read more about the Lily Font here .  Gown Despite being a senior member of the royal family, Prince Louis won\u0027t get a fancy new gown for his christening. But instead, he will wear something extremely special which is an important part of his family\u0027s history.   He\u0027ll wear a replica of the silk and lace christening gown worn by all royal babies since 1841.  The original was commissioned by Queen Victoria for her daughter Victoria and was worn by 62 royal babies, including the Queen. It was made by Scottish dressmaker Janet Sutherland.  But after so much wear the original was becoming too delicate and the family decided to have a replica made for the christening of Prince Edward\u0027s son James in 2008. The new gown was made by the Queen\u0027s dressmaker Angela Kelly and has been worn by every royal baby since, including Prince George, Princess Charlotte and now Prince Louis.

The announcement was made this morning ahead of the special ceremony at the Chapel Royal of St James\u0027s Palace in central London at 4pm. The 11-week-old royal will be joined by his parents\u0027 close friends and relatives. But his great-grandmother the Queen, and her husband Prince Philip, will not be among the guests. A royal source said it was agreed some time ago that 92-year-old Queen Elizabeth would not attend the small, family affair. Her absence is not due to any health issues, the source confirmed.  Queen Elizabeth, the world\u0027s oldest and longest-reigning living monarch, did miss a special service last month because she was feeling under the weather but she has carried out a number of public engagements since then. The monarch is due to return to London today ahead of a busy schedule of events including the RAF Centenary event tomorrow and a meeting with US President Donald Trump on Friday. On top of this, the Queen was reportedly working flat out in Scotland last week. It would seem she is simply not attending the christening due to work commitments. Her decision not to attend was mutually agreed with William and Kate, while Philip has avoided public events - unless he really has to - since his retirement in 2017. He will remain in Norfolk this week.  Kensington Palace said William\u0027s father Prince Charles and his wife Camilla would be present along with younger brother Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle . Also attending are Kate\u0027s parents, her brother and sister and Prince Louis\u0027 six godparents , who are close friends or relatives of William and Kate. They include Kate\u0027s cousin Lucy Middleton, Nicholas van Cutsem, whose daughter was a bridesmaid at May\u0027s wedding of Harry and Meghan, and Guy Pelly, a childhood friend of William\u0027s. I\u0027m delighted and privileged to be christening Prince Louis today - a precious child made in God\u0027s image, just as we all are, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said on Twitter.

But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the rest of the gang are now getting ready for the next big occasion - Prince Louis\u0027 christening . The latest royal baby has been kept out of the spotlight since he was born on April 23 at 11.01am. We got a quick look at the fifth in line to the throne as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took him home from the Lindo Wing at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in central London. But his christening will be the first time we\u0027ve seen him in public since then.  When is Prince Louis\u0027 christening taking place? The date to pop in your diary is Monday, July 9. Kensington Palace has confirmed the service will begin at 4pm and last approximately 40 minutes. Royal babies are usually christened two to three months after they\u0027re born. Prince George was born on July 22, 2013 - and was christened three months and a day later on October 23. Princess Charlotte was born on May 2, 2015 - she was christened two months and three days later on July 5. Where is Prince Louis being christened? The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will lead service, which will be held at The Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace. He will be supported by The Dean of The Chapel Royal, The Right Reverend and Right Honourable the Lord Chartres, and The Sub-Dean of the Chapel Royal, The Reverend Canon Paul Wright. Louis\u0027 brother George was christened at the Chapel Royal in 2013, while sister Charlotte was christened at the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Norfolk in 2015, bear the Sandringham estate. Charlotte was christened in the same church as Princess Diana, while Prince Louis is being christened in the same place as Meghan Markle, who had a private service before marrying Prince Harry.  What Louis is wearing for the christening? Louis will wear a replica of the silk and lace christening gown worn by royal babies since 1841. The original was commissioned by Queen Victoria for her daughter Victoria, and was made of delicate silk and Honiton lace. The replica is made by Angela Kelly, dressmaker to the Queen. But after the christening of Prince Edward\u0027s daughter Louise in 2004 it was decided that the original gown was too delicate to be worn. The Queen\u0027s dressmaker Angela Kelly made a replica which was debuted on Louise\u0027s younger brother James in 2008. The same gown was worn by Prince George and Princess Charlotte at their christenings.  What Kate is wearing to Prince Louis\u0027 christening For Prince George\u0027s christening Kate wore a cream Alexander McQueen dress with ruffle details. For Charlotte, Kate wore the same designer for her dress and shoes.  For Louis the Duchess of is in a dress by McQueen and a hat by Jane Taylor.  The Duchess of Sussex is in Ralph Lauren and a hat by Stephen Jones. The Duchess of Cornwall in Fiona Clare and a Locke hat.   Who are the godparents? Royals typically choose loads of godparents, and it is usually made up of other royals and members of the aristocracy. Louis\u0027 dad Prince William had six godparent - including former King of Greece Constantine II and Princess Alexandra, the Queen’s cousin. Prince George has seven godparents, including Earl Grosvenor, who is one of the wealthiest men in the country, and another member of the Royal family, Zara Tindall.  We now know who Louis\u0027 godparents will be: Mr. Nicholas van Cutsem - a close friend of William and Harry. William is godfather to his daughter Grace.Mr. Guy Pelly - William and Harry\u0027s best friend. Nightclub owner and entrepreneur. Mr. Harry Aubrey-Fletcher - his wedding was the first Will and Kate attend after announcing their engagment. The Lady Laura Meade - her husband, James, attending Eton with William. James is also godfather to Charlotte. Mrs. Robert Carter - Hannah Gillingham, a schoolfriend of the DuchessMiss Lucy Middleton - lawyer and Kate\u0027s cousin  Who will attend Prince Louis\u0027 christening? We now know the confirmed guest list for the christening. The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and MeghanMr. and Mrs. Michael Middleton Mr. and Mrs. James Matthews/Pippa  Mr. James MiddletonThe godparents of Prince Louis and their spouses The Queen and Prince Phillip are not attending.  Why Meghan Markle won\u0027t be godmother The Royals follow a pattern of choosing close friends and even former members of staff rather than family. Meghan, obviously falls in the latter.  Service details Will and Kate have chosen two two hymns, two lessons and two anthems. The Hymns are O Jesus, I Have Promised and Lord of All Hopefulness. The lessons are from St. Mark 10: 13-16, read by Miss Lucy Middleton and Ephesians 3: 14-19, read by Mr Guy Pelly. The anthems are This is the day which the Lord hath made (John Rutter) and Suo G\u0026acircn, a traditional Welsh Lullaby (Gareth Wilson). This is the day which the Lord hath made was composed for The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s Wedding on 29th April, 2011. The anthems will be performed by The Choir of Her Majesty’s Chapel Royal. The Processional Organ Music will be R. Vaughan Williams\u0027 Prelude on \u0027Rhosymedre.\u0027 The Recessional Organ Music will be Prince Johann Ernst von Sachsen-Weimar\u0027s Concerto in G major, BWV 592. When will Prince Louis\u0027 official photos be released? Princess Charlotte\u0027s official photos were released the Thursday after her christening, so expect to wait a few days. Can I watch Prince Louis\u0027 christening? The service is private, but we will have the photos and updates throughout the day here and in Mirror. Is there a reception or party after the christening? Following the service, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will give a private tea at Clarence House. Guests will be served slices of christening cake, which is a tier taken from The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding cake.  Why are guests being served seven year old cake? It\u0027s traditional for guests to be served the parent\u0027s wedding cake - in this case Kate and Will\u0027s - at the reception. The couple saved a tier which will be served up after the christening. Their cake had eight tiers so there\u0027s plenty to go around.   How was the christening announced? Just as they did with George and Charlotte, the royal family announced the details of the christening on Twitter. The statement said: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are pleased to announce that the christening of Prince Louis will take place on Monday 9th July at The Chapel Royal, St James’s Palace, London. Prince Louis will be christened by The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby.   Little Louis was born in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital in Paddington on April 23. Just seven hours after he arrived Kate and Wills showed off their new arrival to the world on the hospital steps. Why Princess Charlotte\u0027s christening was in a different place Instead of Chapel Royal, Charlotte was baptised at the Church of St Mary Magdalene at Sandringham in July 2015. The change wasn\u0027t due to her gender, or her ranking, it was thought to be due to the church\u0027s proximity to the family\u0027s new home in Norfolk. Royal Christening traditions Royal christenings in pictures, from Edward VIII and the Queen to Princess Charlotte Why is July 9 important to the Queen? Go back 71 years and July 9 is the date her majesty, who was then Princess Elizabeth, announced she was engaged to Philip Mountbatten. Even though they were privately engaged for a year before, they didn\u0027t make it public until July 9, 1947. They made the announcement at Buckingham Palace. As is traditional in the royal family, they also released an official photo to mark the occassion. It shows Elizabeth sitting on a chair with Philip sitting on the arm, and they are staring into each others eyes looking very much in love.

Robert Smith and his wife Christine, 61, received a letter from the company with apologies for his \u0027death\u0027 and the details of their subscription cancellation. Mr Smith informed the company that there had been a mistake when he was told his account had closed due to his ‘death’ - only to receive a letter weeks later addressed to the executor of his estate.  “I’m speechless about the whole situation, it’s absolutely disgraceful.” he told Teesside Live .  The 69-year-old from Thornaby-on-Tees said his wife were unhappy as the pair were forced to take out a new package. But as an apology, the couple ended up with a cheaper bill. The saga began around one month ago when Mr Smith noticed that his phone and internet had been disconnected.  “I might be nearly 70-years-old but I’m still alive,” he said. “I’m not happy because I’m classed as dead and I don’t want to be dead.” Despite telling the company that an error had occurred, Mr Smith claims that the situation wasn’t resolved, and this week a letter was delivered to his home addressed to the executor of his estate. It states: “We’re really sorry to hear that Mr Robert Smith has recently passed away, but just wanted to let you know that we have now disconnected the Virgin Media services at their address.” "},{"url":null,"title":"russians mock britain novichok branded","story":"NewsRussians mock Britain with Novichok-branded beer, T-shirts and vodka after death of nerve agent victim Dawn SturgessThe use of the name comes as Russian politicians are openly claiming that Britain deliberately poisoned Dawn Sturgess, 44, in Amesbury\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByWill Stewart12:32, 9 JUL 2018NewsA man wears a T-shirt emblazoned with the Novichok brand name (Image: SpareSkin/east2west news)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRussians are said to be mocking fears of the deadly Novichok nerve agent by using it as a brand name for products just hours after Amesbury mum, Dawn Sturgess, died. Goods emblazoned with the agent name are said to include T-shirts, beer, vodka and coffee. Moscow company Spare Skin are using the name in an eye-catching moniker on products which they claim offer “Russian character”. They say wearers a \u0026pound22 top can expect “the love of beautiful women”, “brutality in the eye” and an “exclusive and cool T-shirt”. The company revealed: “When we posted the design of the Novichok on Behance (social network for designers), we got a huge number of negative reactions, and thought it was a failure. “But at what speed are these T-shirts are selling now.”  But Novichok - the name of a lethal and illegal chemical weapon designed in Soviet times - is also now glamourised as the name of a craft beer, a vodka, a brand of coffee, a cocktail in Volgograd, and vegetable oil. The use of the name comes as Russian politicians are openly claiming that Britain deliberately poisoned Dawn Sturgess, 44, evidently killed by the nerve agent, as well as her partner Charlie Rowley, 45, now fighting for his life. Novichok beer from Alaska Brewery, Moscow promises a “very soft honey taste of melon turns into piquant hissing on the tip of the tongue hop bitterness”. Drinkers are promised “a nerve-paralytic nirvana”. Coffee Novichok is on the market in Russia, sold by the company Berserker Arms, which usually markets mostly foreign military equipment.

Harry Swan and Hugh Shaw are not inductees into Scotland’s Football Hall of Fame.”Rob, formerly of Lochee, Dundee, and now in Vancouver, Canada, continued: “In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Hibs were Scotland’s prestigious team, winning three consecutive league titles.“They gained international attention for their fluid attacking style of play and, in 1953, were invited by the Brazil Football Association to compete in a South American competition.“The Easter Road side accepted the invitation.“Long before the ‘Fab Four’, there was the ‘Fab Five’ – and fabulous they were . . . Gordon Smith, Lawrie Reilly, Willie Ormond, Eddie Turnbull and Bobby Johnstone.“Hibs filled every ground and football fans, regardless of their allegiance, came to watch this great team play with style, panache and score great goals.“Harry Swan was Hibs chairman, and Hugh Shaw was Hibs manager during this exciting era of Scottish football. Swan was outspoken about why there should be seated stadiums for the fans.“He installed floodlights at Easter Road in 1954, when directors at Aberdeen, Celtic, the Dundee clubs, Rangers and Hearts thought floodlights were a fad.“Swan was a man of vision, and Shaw was a brilliant manager.”Football at the highest level was changing, as Rob went on: “At the end of the 1954-55 season, a Frenchman named Gabriel Hanot, ex-French international player and editor of the French Sports newspaper L’Equipe, proposed a football concept that he and his newspaper had devised.“It was to create a European Club Football Competition and would be named ‘The European Cup’.“The winning league champions from 16 European countries were invited to play home and away games during the 1955-56 season.“Aberdeen won the Scottish First Division in the 1954-55 season.“Celtic, Rangers and Hearts came next in the league, with Hibs, now past their peak, in fifth place.“Aberdeen received an invitation to enter this new European competition, but declined.“The Pittodrie board of directors didn’t fancy midweek travel to European grounds and didn’t see a future in this tournament.“The directors of Celtic, Rangers and Hearts had a similar cynicism toward this foreign folly.“Swan and Shaw, however, jumped at the opportunity to enter this European venture, and Gabriel Hanot, a long-time fan of Hibs style of play, agreed that a fifth-placed team could represent Scotland.”Other countries were also not too sure about this new venture.“In England, the FA also had misgivings about this tournament,” continued Rob.“So did Chelsea, the league champions that season, and the Stamford Bridge outfit declined the European invitation.“So Hibs were the first British team to enter a European club competition, and Eddie Turnbull was the first British player to score a goal in the European Cup.“The Hibees, past their peak, made it to the semi-final and were beaten by French side Stade de Reims.“But who won the first European Cup? Real Madrid, of course!“More than a million fans turned out to watch this European football experiment and, in the 1956-57 season, Rangers, representing Scotland, and Manchester United, representing England, accepted an invitation to play in the European Cup, which had now expanded to 22 countries.“Swan, Shaw and Hibs always took the path less travelled, and others followed in their footsteps.”“This is part of the Hall of Fame Mission statement:‘The Hall of Fame is a permanent feature in the Scottish Football Museum and will honour the truly great players, managers and officials who have reached the pinnacle of their profession and have made significant contribution to Scotland’s football reputation through their skill, spirit and determination.’“The Hibs forward line of that great team are inductees into the Hall of Fame.“The mission statement could have been scripted for Swan and Shaw.“Why are these two great football minds, who, at that time, enhanced and enriched Scotland’s reputation as a progressive football nation, not listed in Scotland’s Hall of Fame?”Rob concluded by listing “the first 16 countries to enter and play in the 1955-56 European Cup — Rapid Wien, Anderlecht, AGF Aarhus, Stade Reims, Voros Lobogo, AC Milan, PSV Eindhoven, Gwardia Warszawa, Sporting CP, Saarbrucken, Hibernian, Real Madrid, Djurgarden, Servette, Rot-Weiss Essen, Partizan.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/11/59f99e8988abd-e1509532599593-785x564.jpg ","title":"burton albion snap up ex dundee united ace scott fraser","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee United talisman Scott Fraser has joined Burton Albion.The 23-year-old has joined the English League One side on a two-year deal.Fraser had attracted interest from a host of clubs, including Hearts, but Nigel Clough has managed to secure his services.The young Dundonian left United at the end of May and revealed that he was in talks for a new deal but \u0026#8220felt a change was needed\u0026#8221.Here\u0026#39s our newest signing @ScottFraser_ in training with his new teammates!#FraserBAFC pic.twitter/moNJU7teMB\u0026mdash Burton Albion FC (@burtonalbionfc) July 5, 2018He told the Burton Albion website: \u0026#8220I’m very happy to be here.\u0026#8220When I found out what clubs might be interested this was the best feel I got and having spoken to the manager and coming down to see the ground and training facilities I think it’s a club where I can get better as a player.\u0026#8221He added: “I was coming to the end of my contract and was speaking about a new one, but I just felt a change was needed to move away, grow up and try and improve as a player.

Dundee paid the price for that gamble by failing to get out of a group they had been expected to win comfortably and, ultimately, it was a factor in Hartley losing his job.Under McCann, the policy has been that the Betfred is an important event and it’s first game, not the league kick-off next month, marks the start of the season proper. That’s fine by his vice-captain.“I personally came back feeling really fit and I think as you’ve seen the rest of the boys look really fit as well,” he said.“You can kind of gauge first day back when we do a lot of testing. Everyone is a bit anxious because eyes are on you but this has been the fittest group of boys I’ve seen.“Everyone has a sharpness about them. I don’t know if it’s the modern game and the demands there are on you but everyone has been bang at it.“For me the Betfred two years ago gave me a shock. I remember speaking about it. That season we were straight into the competitive games and you are expected to win them but it doesn’t go that way because that’s football and you have to be ready.“That’s why to get the couple of games we’ve had has been massive and to get away (to Portugal), do some training and have another couple of games is massive as well.”Dundee are now in the Algarve where they’ll do more work and face SC Farense on Tuesday. Kerr’s sure that’ll have them ready for the Betfred tie at Stirling Albion Saturday week.“I enjoy being away. I’ve been to Hungary twice and Austria during pre-season and it’s good for the team.“You get to know the new boys who’ve come because you are together all the time and that’s important. We’re doing two sessions a day, eating meals together and spending time together at night as well.“That’s important because when you have new team-mates you can’t just go out on a pitch and gel right away. It takes work and time.”With the cup games looming large, Kerr feels the time away is also a chance to prepare properly.“We’re back in the middle of next week and then right into the first tie on the Saturday, so we can do a bit of work for that as well as the general stuff we’ve been doing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"community chest broughty ymca seeks cash to bring facilities up to 21st century standard","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBroughty Ferry YMCA is hoping to land some of the cash in the Tele’s Community Chest.The group runs a community centre on Brook Street that aims to provide affordable services to everyone in the area.The centre hosts various activities ranging from ballet classes for youngsters to exercise classes for those aged 50-plus.It also has a community garden and men’s shed.There are just three weeks left to collect tokens in the Community Chest giveaway, which is your opportunity to get a share of £10,000 for your non-profit group or club.David Mills, one of the fundraising directors at the YMCA, said: “We are all excited about trying to collect as many tokens as we possibly can.Community Chest 2018“Any funds that we get go straight back into what we do on the front line.“Whatever we get from the competition is a bonus.”The YMCA’s current project involves renovating its Victorian gym and turning it into a state-of-the-art facility, which is where any cash it receives will go.David added: “The showers need brought up to 21st Century standards and then more people would be able to use them.”He said money would go towards equipment, toilet facilities and making sure the building is accessible to people in wheelchairs.He added: “We want to turn it into something we can be proud of.“We want people to come and use a facility that is beautiful on the outside but still in keeping with the heritage and, at the same time, that it is as good as we can make it.”For your chance to grab some cash, all you have to do is work as a team to collect as many of the tokens printed in the Evening  as possible from now until Saturday July 28.Don’t miss out on your chance to enter our Community Chest competition by visiting thetele/promotions.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b335b8da880a.jpg ","title":"donkey joins in celebrations as dundee woman sandra turns 50","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBirthday girl Sandra McIntosh had an unusual visitor on her special day in the shape of Donkey Bond, a miniature donkey.Sandra, from Downfield, turned 50 and was delighted by the visit from the cute donkey who lives with owner Alison Wiseman at Balnuith Farm, Tealing.The surprise was arranged by Sandra’s fiance Scott Findlay and their friend Nicky Millen.Shocked Sandra said: \u0026#8220You don’t expect to open your door and a donkey to be there, do you?“Maybe flowers or chocolates but I would never have imagined Donkey Bond would be there.“He was so cute.

Before heading west, the young centre-half turned out for his parent club in the friendly draw at Brechin last Friday.And watching on was a scout from an English Premier League outfit who had headed north to specifically have a look at him.While that’s unlikely to lead to an immediate move to take him south, his first few appearances at Morton are likely to be monitored.Should Waddell impress, there’s still the possibility an offer for him could be forthcoming before the transfer window closes at the end of next month.It would take a substantial offer to persuade Dundee to part with him.

The teams coming down will have an expectation to go straight back up.“Then there are teams that have been down there for a while that will have a real go at getting up.“I would probably goes as far as to be saying in Scotland right now it is the toughest league.“The Championship is the most competitive but we are a club that have ambitions and we are one I think should be in the Premiership. I think we can all agree on that.”That’s pretty much all he has to say on that last point. He knows the best place to show United’s intent won’t be in interviews but out on the pitch and by getting results.And as Csaba Laszlo’s new-look side gels, he’s confident that will be the case.“We need to do our talking on the pitch,” he added.“Hopefully, all the pieces will come together during the season and the goal is to get to the Premiership.“It is going to take time but the pre-season games and the Betfred Cup games before the league season starts are all preparation for the first game against Dunfermline.“And the Betfred Cup gives us competitive games before the season starts but at the end of the day it is part of our preparation for the start of the league.“It’s a lot better playing games than training all the time but we do want to go on a nice cup run as well.”The early signs up at Glebe Park were encouraging and Aird admits he was pleased with how things went for both himself and his new team-mates.“Obviously, I was delighted to get a run out and get the goal. It was my first game for Dundee United and it was great to get started.“It was a pre-season game and the big thing was to get minutes on the pitch and that was good.“And the goal was good for the confidence going forward.“It was the first time all the boys had played together and gave the manager the chance to have a look at us in a game rather than training.”While it goes without saying United have taken something of a gamble by making so many signings in one summer.There have already been nine new arrivals and the manager has revealed he’d like as many as another four before the Betfred Cup kicks off against Arbroath next week.Rather than being daunted by that, though, Aird is relishing the challenge of being part of what could be a completely new team.“It was a position when they signed nine new players that it was the rebuilding of a club.“The number of signings excited me.

It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in

There will be outdoor games, dance, football, skateboarding and BMXing.”From Saturdayto August 17, the sessions will be at Torry Skatepark from 6pm on Mondays, Tesco Woodend from 5.30pm on Tuesdays, Kincorth Skatepart from 5.30pm on Wednesdays, Northfield Skatepark from 5.30pm on Thursdays and Bridge of Don Skatepark from 5.30pm on Fridays.Visit facebook/transitionextremesports for more information.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b42fb8d171d3-846x564.jpg ","title":"work on major upgrade of north east railway line making good progress","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWork on a major upgrade on a north-east railway line is on track, according to a transport operator.The Aberdeen to Dyce line has been shut since May to allow for the improvement work.A replacement bus service has operated during the closure and the project, which is taking place over 14 weeks, is now more than half complete.Network Rail has told the Evening Express that the work is “going well and on time”.It is part of the ambitious programme of works to double track the line between Aberdeen and Inverness.By the time the work is finished next month, 12 miles of rail will have been laid, as well as work on more than 20,000 sleepers and the replacing or refurbishing of five bridges along the line.The rail operator has released images of the work being done at different sites on the line, including Farburn Terrace in Dyce.The bridge at Dyce was demolished in mid-June and a new wider bridge was installed.Extensive ground work has also been carried out at Kittybrewster, Woodside, Bucksburn and Stoneywood. During the rail project, 1,640 concrete blocks weighing more than 5,000 tonnes will be installed. New signalling equipment will also be put into position along the line during this phase of the works programme.A spokesman for Network Rail said: “The work is part of the Scottish Government-funded Aberdeen-Inverness Improvement Project to reduce journey times and increase capacity on the route between the two cities.“Once complete, the project will provide a daytime hourly commuter service between Inverness and Elgin by December 2018.“Also, there will be a half-hourly service between Aberdeen and Inverurie by the end of 2019, and it will increase end-to-end services to an hourly frequency in the longer term.”Work has been ongoing 24 hours a day, seven days a week throughout the closure.North East Liberal Democrat MSP Mike Rumbles said: “It should not be a surprise when a major project is delivered on time. This is an important section of track that, once delivered, will benefit local rail users.“Until then, Network Rail should concentrate on mitigating the disruption for passengers.“I’m pleased that there have been no delays to the work so far, but I want to see more being done to keep local communities informed and greater provision for alternative transport at peak times.”The latest phase of the project began in February with Network Rail engineers carrying out work to clear weeds on the line around Kittybrewster and Tillydrone.By August 2019, the rail operator is also looking to install a second track and signalling equipment between Dyce and Inverurie.It would also see the current signal boxes removed.Colin Clark, Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon, said: “I recently visited the project sites in Inverurie, Kintore and Stoneywood and I have been very impressed with the work so far.“It is a huge and complicated operation – an incredible 23,000 tonnes of ballast have been delivered so far.“The project has meant long periods of disruption to services, which can be very frustrating.“However, people will have to be patient.“The end result will be a greatly-improved service, with more frequent trains and greater capacity.”The Aberdeen to Dyce route is expected to be closed until August 20.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 22","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 31/05/18, 11:50 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.CalMac management’s shocking handling of our ferry service is taking its toll on local businesses which depend on Islay’s growing tourist trade.We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.Also, I have been unimpressed with our roads department management’s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from residents and myself about the potholes across Islay.Councillor Alastair Redman, IslaySir,I\u0026#8217m inviting your readers to get their walking boots or trainers on for the Stroke Association and sign up to the summer marathon challenge, Walk Your Way.In April 2013, a year after my own stroke, I took on​ the London Marathon.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker.

All four girls contributed valuable points, with Jemma excelling in the 75 metres sprint recording a time of 12.65 seconds. Jorja was the top Mid Argyll girl in the long jump reaching 3.03 metres and also had a respectable 10.55 metres throw with the 500g turbo javelin.The girls B team finished ahead of the A team in 28th overall, mainly due to an excellent 14.25 metres javelin throw by Sophie Balkeen. This throw ensured fifth place overall for Sophie out of almost 200 girls and the points gained allowed the B team to finish above the A team. The A team finished only half a second ahead of the B team in the 4 x 100 metres relay. The B team consisted of Maisie Gilmour and Jodie Allan from Ardrishaig, Sophie Balkeen from Lochgair and Erin Naisby from Furnace.The girls contest was won by Law and District.This national competition was a great experience, not just for the young athletes competing in the big arena, but also for the supportive parents who provided transport on the day.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dust flies in cracking argyll rally","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 05/07/18, 12:07 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The Dunoon Presents Rally on June 23 saw the Scottish Rally Championship roll into town and 58 top-spec cars and crews take to the stages.Dust flew in dry conditions up in the hills of Cowal as drivers tested their skills among forestry roads in what turned out to be an excellent rally.The route this year was slightly different, with two new stages added to a schedule which saw the cars cover each of the four stages twice through the day with two service stops at Dunoon Stadium along the way.There were a few well known Argyll faces out there, with mixed fortunes on the day.Douglas Watt from Furnace managed to rebuild his Escort after its small excursion on the Scottish Rally in May and he was out again, hoping for better luck and a finish for he and his co-driver, Mark Grierson. The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

Isabelle Cairns, of Ayr, has hit out at the amount of rubbish being left on the beach. And the Financial Adviser feels that the council could do more. Isabelle said: “There are two beaches here, one part gets cleaned and one doesn’t. “Between Doonfoot side and the Pavillion is generally clean. “But the rest is neglected. “There was a petition signed about this and the fact the council have stopped cleaning parts of the beach. “There are plastic bottles all over the place, I even saw dirty nappies lying. “I get that it costs a lot of money to get staff out, but there are other options for the council.  “They could get community workers in, the ones who are serving community payback orders.” Isabelle claims that Ayr has little to offer outside the beach these days. She said: “What’s in Ayr now? It’s a ghost town. “There is not a lot about, but the beach is an attraction that brings in people from all over the country. “Walking along the beach seeing this mess was nothing short of disgusting. “It gets to me as it’s such a beautiful beach. “What you also have to think about is that all kinds of rubbish is going to be washed out to sea when the tide comes in.  “It’s just going to get even worse going forward as the schools are now off. “More people will be going to the beach and it’s just going to become an absolute travesty. “People have no respect for the beach, but the council should have someone cleaning up when it’s like that.” A council spokesman said: “We monitor our beaches closely and work within the national guidance and with available resources to keep our beaches looking their best, so they can be enjoyed by local people and visitors alike. “We clean and litter-pick the full stretch of Ayr Beach and ask people to dispose of their waste in our bins rather than abandoning rubbish on the sand. “The section from Cromwell Road to the Pier is not routinely mechanically cleaned as it’s classed as an amenity beach rather than a recreational beach, but the stretch is still managed on a regular basis.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lane closure inspection station hotel","story":"NewsLane closure as inspection at Station HotelGable end of the building to be investigated\u0026nbspShareByGary Fanning17:58, 6 JUL 2018Updated18:03, 6 JUL 2018NewsFront entrance to Ayr railway station is blocked off (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne lane of the A70 will be shut off to allow for an inspecton of the gable wall of the Station Hotel just off Burns Statute Square. In order to carry out the inspection, one lane of the A70 which runs over the railway bridge towards Holmston Road and Station Road will be closed temporarily from tomorrow (7th July 2018). The section of the pavement which runs adjacent to the road will also be closed on a temporary basis. The inspection to assess the gable end will form part of the overall structural survey which the Council is undertaking to obtain a detailed report on the condition of the building. Trains are expected to run as normal, however the temporary pavement closure may affect passengers making their way to and from platform 4. Since the closure of the main entrance, some passengers have been using the pavement next to the A70 as an alternative route. Network Rail and Scotrail have been informed of the partial road closure and we are working with them to ensure passengers can get to and from the various platforms as easily and as safely as possible. Donald Gillies, Director – Place at South Ayrshire Council said: “We’re linking with our partners to limit disruption to the public however these inspections and subsequent works are necessary at this time.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet. The everyday worries and thoughts I described like a train racing out of control?

Identity cards can be faked \u0026ndash phone the company to verify their identity.\n\u0026bull Some companies offer a password system. Ask your utility providers if this can be used and if you have a password with a company make sure the caller uses it.\n\u0026bull Never let people try to persuade you to let them into your home even if they are asking for help \u0026ndash they may not be genuine. If someone is persistent, ask them to call at another time and arrange for a friend or family member to be with you.\n\u0026bull Never agree to pay for goods or give money to strangers who arrive at your door.\n\u0026bull Don\u0026rsquot keep large amounts of money in your home.\n\u0026bull Remember, it\u0026rsquos your home.

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in many years.To help customers use water wisely, advice is at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or by calling 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer,Chief Operating Officer,Scottish

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7972409.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cement-plant-says-sorry-for-cars-being-coated-in-dust","story":"  Numerous complaints were made on social media regarding cars and, in particular, car windscreens being covered in dust late last month.  Residents such as Seona Mason-Chadburn, who lives in Dunbar town centre, contacted the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Tarmac, which operates Dunbar Cement Plant to the south-east of the town, about the discharge.  She told the Courier how she had attempted to use her window wipers to clear her front windscreen, only to discover the dust.  She said her windscreen felt like \u0026ldquosandpaper and compared the dust to the \u0026ldquobloom on a black grape.  A spokesman for SEPA added: \u0026ldquoEvery day SEPA works to protect and enhance Scotland\u0026rsquos environment and we are clear that compliance is non-negotiable.  \u0026ldquoIn response to local complaints, SEPA officers responded to reports of significant dust in the Dunbar area.  \u0026ldquoOfficers identified the source of the dust and are working with Tarmac to prevent a re-occurrence.  \u0026ldquoWe would advise members of the public to contact our 24-hour pollution hotline on 0800 807060 to report pollution events.  Tarmac has confirmed that the dust escaped, with an internal investigation being carried out.  Oliver Curtin, plant manager, said: \u0026ldquoIn the early hours of May 24 we experienced an isolated and brief incident where a small amount of limestone-based dust escaped from the site.  \u0026ldquoWe took action quickly and have been working with SEPA and conducting our own investigations to prevent a recurrence.

As soon as the discharge was detected, the process was \u0026ldquoimmediately shut down but \u0026ldquounfortunately some dust had already escaped into the atmosphere, said Tarmac.  The dry weather and wind direction resulted in the dust being carried towards Dunbar.

A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"  When the final of this year\u0026rsquos Scottish Black Pudding Championship was held earlier this month at the Edinburgh New Town Cook School, it was Anderson\u0027s Quality Butchers who came out on top.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"  Police said one person was trapped in a car which has overturned and they have closed the road while work to free them is carried out.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.

A post from the youth project said: \u0026ldquoOver the past three years, young people have been looking at youth provision in North Berwick and have been shocked to learn just how much has been lost and never replaced.  \u0026ldquoThe team have been working hard to receive advice from East Lothian Council on what can be put in place to ensure a safe environment for all, as well as actions which can be taken to discourage anti-social behaviour. The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.

Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.

The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.

Four were brought to the surface on Sunday, more than two weeks after a football team and their coach were trapped underground.  The next phase of the operation will start in 10 to 20 hours, according to authorities.  Chief of operations governor Narongsak Osatanakorn said 13 foreign and five Thai divers are taking part in the operation.  The British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC) confirmed that seven divers from the UK with \u0026ldquoexpertise in cave diving are assisting.  Two elite British divers, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, were the first rescuers to reach the group on Monday night and are believed to be part of the team.  A BCRC spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe UK divers are part of the core team, so they will be actively involved and that will include escorting each child out through the flooded passage.  \u0026ldquoThe operation is being supervised by the Thai authorities.  \u0026ldquoThey have had to make a quick decision because they are really concerned about the water level rising.  Two divers will accompany each boy as they are gradually extracted.  The entire operation to get all 13 out of the cave could take two to four days, depending on weather and water conditions, said Thai army Major General Chalongchai Chaiyakam.  A doctor and paramedics are standing by to provide medical attention whenever the rescue team emerges.  Rescuers pumped millions of litres of water out of the cave network to try to extract the group through nearly a mile of tunnels.  Thai officials are not only racing against worsening weather, but also lowered oxygen levels in the underground complex in the north of the country.  Former Thai navy Seal Saman Kunan passed out making the dive on Friday and died.  The boys, aged 11-16, and their coach, 25, were trapped inside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in the northern province of Chiang Rai after a football game on June 23.  Monsoon flooding cut off their escape and they have been on a rocky shelf inside a cave chamber since.  Although weak, they are largely in good health, authorities have said."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8040109.jpg?type=article-full","title":"from-draughty-dorms-to-en-suite-comforts-hostelling-evolution-in-scotland","story":"  The Glen Nevis hostel at the foot of Britain\u0027s highest mountain is still an oasis for hikers, cyclists and low-budget sightseers, but it has now been kitted out for the modern visitor with en-suite rooms and connectivity, plush five-star reception-style couches in communal areas and picture windows looking onto the Nevis rang.  Although it is now less yomping youths and more budget family hotel, half of the 72 beds are still dedicated to shared dormitories for those who like the simple charm of communal living for which the hostels are famed.  As it nears its 9th decade, the organisation that runs the 34 Scottish hostels undertaken a name-change - from the Scottish Youth Hostels Association to Hostelling Scotland - which was executed this year.  Research showed that while older people used and still use or are rediscovering hostelling, younger people understood the concept less.  Glen Nevis is part of the resulting overhaul that includes developing gems like its hostel on the edge of Loch Ossian, renovation of Lochranza on Arran and could also include expansion with new properties including in St Andrews.  Wardens are also consigned to history, with managers there in their place and new apprenticeships are being developed to help bring in young staff.    Margo Paterson, Hostelling Scotland chief executive, said the evolution will continue as the organisation settles into its new identity.  She said: \"This major redevelopment project truly reflects our commitment to the modernisation of our accommodation network.  \"It also highlights our mission to make more of Scotland more accessible to more people than anyone else, and especially young people, providing great value, affordable, flexible and welcoming accommodation in the best locations across Scotland.\"  She said:\u0026nbsp\"We pride ourselves in excellent customer service, listening to our members and guests, understanding their needs and developing our network to offer the best possible hostelling experience.  \"The new Glen Nevis Youth Hostel, one of our flagship hostels, highlights this perfectly. We want guests to discover the real Scotland with us.\"  She said removing the word youth from their title did not reflect a move away from core customers and schemes to help groups of young people embark on rural adventures are also under way.  The \u0026pound6 membership and guest overnight income supports its charitable youth programmes and the maintenance of the hostelling network.  Following the strategic review of the organisation early in 2018, the 88-year-old hostelling association said: \"The new identity follows on from extensive marketing research and reflects the organisation\u0026rsquos commitment to understanding the needs of its members, guests and employees as the modern face of Scottish Hostelling.  \"The name also more clearly indicates its representation of Hostelling International within Scotland.\"  The 34 Hostelling Scotland hostels is about half of the number hostels from a decade ago, but it attracts 380,000 guests every year, with a turnover of \u0026pound9m and an estimated contribution to the Scottish visitor economy of \u0026pound25m.  As well as the network of hostels across Scotland, members get dual membership with Hostelling International, providing access to more than 4,000 youth hostels in over 90 countries worldwide."},{"url":null,"title":"alan-roden-should-scots-support-england-no-it-only-makes-victory-sweeter-for-us","story":"  I sat my final exam at college in the morning before heading to a pub where happy hour pints were just \u0026pound1.  There were Saltires hanging above the bar, and a raucous crowd that erupted in cheers when John Collins scored a penalty to level the game against the reigning champions.  The pub was in York the audience was largely English.  Growing up in northern England, it never occurred to me not to support Scotland, or any of the home nations. Why wouldn\u0026rsquot I?  Unless we were playing each other, of course.  I am a passionate England fan it was Italia \u0026rsquo90 that hooked me. I couldn\u0026rsquot watch the Egypt game live so I recorded it on VHS and watched it in full when I got home. I watched the Cameroon quarter final \u0026ndash the last time England won at that level before Saturday - on a black-and-white TV in my aunt\u0026rsquos farmhouse, and was allowed to stay up late to watch the West Germany semi-final on a tiny TV in my bedroom, before crying myself to sleep.  The first poster on my bedroom wall was of Gary Lineker I\u0026rsquoll never forget watching Gazza play against Sweden at Elland Road in the Umbro tournament in 1995 I had to be picked up off the floor outside a Corfu bar in 1998 because I was inconsolable when Argentina knocked us out on penalties in the knockout stages.  Then, perhaps unwisely for such a diehard England fan, I moved to Scotland.  England\u0026rsquos next tournament game was in Euro 2000, against Portugal. I watched it in a bar in Edinburgh and it was my first real experience of the Anyone But England (ABE) phenomenon.  When Portugal came back from 2-0 down to win the game, the cheers and cries of \"sunny Portugal, we\u0026rsquoll support you ever more\" were deafening.  For someone who grew up in England, yet always supported Scotland, it stunned me. I simply wasn\u0026rsquot prepared for the animosity. I was bitter and upset.  But that was then this is now. Nearly two decades on, I get it, and I revel in it. It\u0026rsquos a footballing rivalry and it\u0026rsquos a healthy one. I even felt comfortable enough to watch last year\u0026rsquos Scotland v England game in the home end at Hampden.  I watched England\u0026rsquos World Cup game against Panama in an Edinburgh bar. There were fans in England tops bellowing out \"It\u0026rsquos Coming Home\", while others cheered Panama\u0026rsquos consolation goal as if it had been scored by Leigh Griffiths himself. It was a cracking atmosphere, with no hint of tension.  Traditionally, of course, it\u0026rsquos the ABE crowd which has more fun. Like the time Frank Lampard\u0026rsquos goal against Germany was disallowed and we went on to lose 4-1. Or the time Portugal knocked us out on penalties. Correction: times, plural.  The pain of defeat has hurt over the years, but boy is this tournament is making up for it.  Every two years the same debate takes place: should Scots support the Auld Enemy?  There are those who insist Scots should back England, arguing that to do otherwise is embarrassing. I\u0026rsquom not one of them \u0026ndash it makes victory even sweeter for us.  There are those \u0026ndash mainly politicians \u0026ndash who pick another team for spurious reasons. The correct choice for politicians whose nation is not playing is that they\u0026rsquore not supporting anyone, precisely because their nation is not playing.  And there are those who watch every England game in the hope of a humiliating defeat for the Three Lions.  This contingent is smaller than in previous years, and some put that down to the humility of Gareth Southgate and his young squad. Yet perhaps a bigger reason is we now have a generation of Scotland fans who have never known qualification for a major tournament, making rooting for England\u0026rsquos opponents all the more futile.  In the binary world of post-indyref Scotland, where everyone is forced to be a Unionist or a Nationalist, it is inevitable that politics poisons the football debate.  In a newspaper column last week, the pro-independence columnist Lesley Riddoch wrote: \u0026ldquoAs Scotland finds its new place in the North Atlantic and the league of small, energy-rich European states, our age-old enmity with England will become utterly irrelevant.  Completely failing to understand that the enmity is to do with a footballing rivalry, not the constitution, does she actually think independence involves sawing along the border and allowing Scotland to float off in the direction of Iceland?  She added: \u0026ldquoOne day, football and the constitutional question in Scotland will be equally disconnected.  It always has been, Lesley, and it\u0026rsquos only fanatical nationalists who make it otherwise.  Among real fans, there is no link between constitutional preference and support or otherwise for England. Some of the most vociferous ABE backers I know are diehard Tories.  It is perfectly acceptable to want Scotland to be part of the UK and to want England to be crushed on the football pitch. It\u0026rsquos also perfectly acceptable to want Scotland to leave the UK and to want England to win on the football pitch.  Or any combination of the above: there are no strict rules.  You don\u0026rsquot get much more passionate about independence than the SNP\u0026rsquos former Westminster leader Angus Robertson, who tweeted this week: \u0026ldquoAbsolutely delighted for England, all English fans, friends and relations. Congratulations.  Oh how the SNP misses him in the Commons.  It\u0026rsquos hard to imagine Angus would have resorted to such petty antics as his successor Ian Blackford and colleagues did last week, when they repeatedly dawdled through the voting lobby and ensured English MPs and Commons staff missed the Colombia game.  A healthy rivalry should not involve sabotage. Just imagine if Scotland had qualified for the tournament and English MPs pulled the same stunt during a crunch match.  So it\u0026rsquos the semi-final against Croatia on Wednesday. Nearly three decades since the last time England reached this stage. Just like Gazza in Turin, it\u0026rsquoll probably end in tears.  But maybe, just maybe, Southgate\u0026rsquos men really are going to bring football home. After all those penalty defeats, all the failures of the \"golden generation\", all the crushed dreams, what absolute joy that will bring me \u0026ndash and what pain it will bring for so many Scotland fans.  I absolutely can\u0026rsquot wait."},{"url":null,"title":"melissa-george-tough-girl-who-told-weinstein-he-looked-ridiculous","story":"  You should try it, she says. I\u0026rsquom not sure I have the equipment, Melissa. Nor the nipple tassels.  Melissa George is an Australian actor who lives in Paris, who once upon a time appeared in Home And Away and these days works alongside Sean Penn and Gabriel Byrne. You will have seen her in films such as Mulholland Drive or The Amityville Horror or Derailed, or maybe on TV in Friends or Grey\u0026rsquos Anatomy.  She is funny, earthy (see above), outspoken (see below) and lives in France, where she is a single mother of two boys. It\u0026rsquos Friday afternoon, and she got off the plane from Paris only a couple of hours ago and here we are in the Caledonian Hotel, Edinburgh, discussing the techniques of burlesque dancing.  The reason is her new film The Butterfly Tree, which is receiving its UK premiere at the Edinburgh International Festival a few hours after we speak. It\u0026rsquos an Australian movie about grief and desire and illness and flowers, roller skating and, yes, nipple tassels.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never seen a burlesque dancer with nipple tassels on roller skates and butterfly wings, George points out. Watch The Butterfly Tree and you will see George tackling all of the above. \u0026ldquoThis is not easy.  I know I made it look easy, but it\u0026rsquos not easy.  I think that we nailed it.  Making the film in Queensland, Australia, she says was one of the happiest experiences of her life. She travelled with her two sons, the youngest only a few months old.  \u0026ldquoI was obviously still feeding my son, she points out. \u0026ldquoNot many mothers after giving birth get to play a burlesque dancer with barely nothing on. I love stuff like that when you\u0026rsquore personally stretched and professionally stretched at the same time.  The film gives George a chance to channel her inner Blanche DuBois goes disco. She plays a former burlesque dancer turned florist who brings a little bit of sunshine into the life of a widower and his teenage son while hiding her own secrets.  It\u0026rsquos a movie about the male gaze made by a female director, Priscilla Cameron. George\u0026rsquos character Evelyn is a woman who has been looked at all her life. \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos every reason for it in a way, George points out. \u0026ldquoWomen are beautiful. They are shaped beautifully.  Born in Perth, western Australia, in 1976, these days George\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoStrine has the faintest hint of a French flavour in the speaking. She seems very at home in Paris. Last night, she tells me, she had dinner with the French film director Leos (Holy Motors) Carax. \u0026ldquoWe meet once a week at the same restaurant. We have the same meal and just talk about updates of the week. I adore him.  \u0026ldquoBeing in Paris opens you to all sorts of places and people.  And yet, anyone with a passing interest in George will know that life in the French capital has not been easy of late. George has come through a bitter custody dispute over her two sons with her ex-partner Jean David, founder of AlloCine.  The couple now share custody, which is why George has to stay in Paris. What\u0026rsquos the shape of life in 2018, I ask her?  \u0026ldquoThe shape of life doesn\u0026rsquot have a shape. There\u0026rsquos no shape. What\u0026rsquos the shape for me?  I wake up in the morning, put my feet on the floor, take a deep breath, look at my phone. Any fires to put out? No? Ooh, it\u0026rsquos going to be a good morning. Go for lunch, look at the phone again. Any fires to put out? Yes. Not such a good afternoon. It\u0026rsquos like that.  But George, who was previously married to the Chilean film director Claudio Dabed, says she is beginning to find her feet again. \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos a great feeling.  \u0026ldquoAnd, you know, if you want to treat yourself to life you go to Paris anyway, don\u0026rsquot you? I\u0026rsquom reminding myself of that every day.  Work is looking up, too. She recently shot a new TV series, The First, in New Orleans with Sean Penn and she\u0026rsquos still buzzing about it. \u0026ldquoI got to work with my idol and every day he gave me everything he had, absolutely everything he had.  It was on the set of The First, too, that she first started noticing the impact of the #MeToo movement. \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquore not so sexualised any more on set, she says. \u0026ldquoA lot of the male crew are a lot politer. Everything is kind of shifting and it\u0026rsquos also making women have a lot more respect for themselves too. Time\u0026rsquos for us now. We have to make the most of it and we have to step it up a little bit too.  We have to talk about Harvey Weinstein. The Hollywood producer who last month pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and criminal sex act charges in New York. Leading actresses, including Romola Garai and Kate Beckinsale, have accused Weinstein of arranging business meetings in hotels with them and turning up to find him dressed only in a bathrobe.  George made three films with Weinstein, including The Amityville Horror remake and Derailed. What she remembers is just how important he once was.  \u0026ldquoWhen I had meetings with Harvey Weinstein it was like \u0026lsquoOh my God if I don\u0026rsquot impress Harvey in this breakfast meeting I\u0026rsquom not going to get the movie.\u0026rsquo That\u0026rsquos how we used to think. Now it\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoIf I\u0026rsquom not a great actress and a respectable woman and human being I\u0026rsquom not going to get the role\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoBut I remember being at the Peninsula [hotel] shaking because I was about to meet Harvey Weinstein.  \u0026ldquoI was an Australian tough girl and have seen Harvey so many times. He\u0026rsquos always been so respectful, always a gentleman always very kind because I give off the energy to him that I\u0026rsquom not going to accept anything otherwise.  That said, after one meeting she believes she was demoted from the lead female role in Derailed to that of the wife, with Jennifer Aniston drafted in to take the role she had originally.  Still, she says, \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never had anything but pleasant experiences with that man. But I know why. It\u0026rsquos because I showed him that\u0026rsquos the way it\u0026rsquos going to be.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos no excuse for what he\u0026rsquos done and it\u0026rsquos no excuse for the way he manipulated certain women into doing certain things but in my case ... I just remember saying: \u0026lsquoyou look ridiculous with what you\u0026rsquore wearing.\u0026rsquo Suddenly the penny drops. Hold on, Melissa, sorry, I say, what he was wearing?  \u0026ldquoWell, we know what he wears.  A bathrobe? \u0026ldquoYes, so I remember saying: \u0026lsquoYou look ridiculous and I hope I leave the meeting with the lead in Amityville Horror\u0026rsquo.  This is Melissa George the tough Australian girl speaking. I am beginning to see how tough.  \u0026ldquoI had nothing but very good experiences with Harvey, she repeats. \u0026ldquoBut I know it\u0026rsquos got a lot to do with how I handled the situation. I\u0026rsquom not a #MeToo.

Two years after he died at the age of 97, the most decorated pilot in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) has been permanently honoured with a statue at Edinburgh Airport, his old base.  And there are additional plans for a more far-reaching memorial to the Leith-born aviator, with the scholarship being considered by a group of former pilots connected to his old university.    Eric Brown in a Wildcat, one of the 487 different types of aircraft he flew \u0026ndash a world record  The ex-pilots from the Edinburgh University Air Squadron Association (EUASA) got together to raise the funds for the life-sized bronze statue of Captain Brown, by Scottish sculptor David Annand.  Now Dr Hamish Macleod, chairman of EUASA, said the squadron also wants to put the scholarship in place to allow young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to access light aircraft flying.  He said: \u0026ldquoWinkle was not only a man who loved to fly, but he also inspired a generation of pilots with his modest good humour and outstanding courage. The statue of him outside Edinburgh Airport will give the many thousands of passengers the opportunity to reflect on this Scottish hero who can inspire us all.  \u0026ldquoWinkle\u0026rsquos legacy can also bring a life-changing experience to today\u0026rsquos youngsters assisting them to learn to fly, or simply experiencing the thrill of flying in small aircraft.  The squadron raised \u0026pound50,000 for the statue and are bidding to raise a further \u0026pound50,000 to set up scholarships, with the estimated cost to achieve solo flying standard being \u0026pound3,000.  Captain Brown\u0026rsquos own flying experience started with a bumpy but exhilarating ride in his father\u0026rsquos First World War Royal Flying Corps bi-plane, which sowed the seed of ambition in an eager eight-year-old.  He learned to fly himself at the earliest opportunity he could after leaving Fettes College as a student at Edinburgh University, which was an RAF recruitment route.    Prince Andrew unveiled statue of Captain Eric Brown  During his early adventures, he saw Hitler\u0026rsquos oratory at the 1936 Berlin Olympics with his father and at one stage in his life managed to sing with the Glenn Miller band.  He became a British Royal Navy officer after training at RAF Turnhouse, now Edinburgh Airport, in the late 1930s and came to be affectionately called Winkle, short for periwinkle, by his friends because of his physical stature.  His most amazing achievements were in his role as a Royal Navy test pilot, during which he pioneered the perfecting of breakneck aircraft carrier deck landings.  Captain Brown holds the world record for flying the greatest number of different types of aircraft, a total of 487, which is a feat unlikely to be rivalled. The highly-decorated pilot also holds the world record for landings on aircraft carriers, at 2,407, and for take-offs on aircraft carriers, at 2,721.  Also in action, he used his language skills to interview Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering, and was among those who liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.  He flew home a rocket-powered enemy aircraft, a Messerschmitt Me 163B-1a Komet, back to Britain from Germany after the aircraft was captured in 1945.    Sir John Elvidge, chairman of Edinburgh Airport, said: \u0026ldquoCaptain Eric \u0026lsquoWinkle\u0026rsquo Brown is a someone who is synonymous with RAF Turnhouse and, in turn, a key figure in the history of what is now Edinburgh Airport.  \u0026ldquoHis achievements speak for themselves and the fact his remarkable career is still held in such high regard after all these years is testament to the man himself.  \u0026ldquoWe are proud of the connection between Edinburgh Airport and the RAF and we want people to share that by learning about this truly inspiring man who served his country with great honour, and this statue is a small token of thanks to him and his legacy.  The statue to honour Leith-born Captain Brown was unveiled at Edinburgh Airport by the Duke of York, who himself served as a pilot in the Royal Navy for almost 20 years and now holds the rank of Vice Admiral.  The pilot has also received high praise from British astronaut Tim Peake who when he died tweeted a tribute from the International Space Station saying Capt Brown was \u0026ldquoto my mind the greatest test pilot who has ever lived.  First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas, said when Captain Brown died that he was one of the Royal Navy\u0026rsquos greats.  Paying tribute after his death, he said: \u0026ldquoThe Fleet Air Arm may have lost one of its finest and best-known pilots, but British aviation has lost something even greater \u0026ndash the most accomplished test pilot of his generation and perhaps of all time, and a huge advocate of military aviation.  His family said in a statement released after his death: \u0026ldquoEric was the most decorated pilot of the Fleet Air Arm, in which service he was universally known as \u0026lsquoWinkle\u0026rsquo on account of his diminutive stature.  \u0026ldquoHe also held three absolute Guinness World Records, including for the number of aircraft carrier deck landings and types of aeroplane flown."},{"url":null,"title":"island-vigil-for-alesha-macphail","story":"  Local people gathered to light candles for the six-year-old in Rothesay\u0026rsquos Guildford Square on Sunday evening.

The initiatives included in the Government\u0026rsquos Road to Zero Strategy include more money to fund charging infrastructure and the need to assess whether new homes and offices should be required to install charge points as standard.  The strategy calls for new street lighting columns on UK roads with on-street parking to have charging points in appropriate locations.  The Government is also expected to outline more details of its ban on sales of new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040.  Alternatively-fuelled vehicles such as hybrids and pure electrics held just 5.5% of the UK\u0026rsquos new car market in the first six months of the year, compared with 4.2% during the same period in 2017.  Launching the Government\u0026rsquos plans to boost take-up of the technology, Mr Grayling will say: \u0026ldquoThe Road to Zero Strategy, combined with the measures we\u0026rsquove already introduced, will mean Britain now has one of the most comprehensive support packages for zero-emission vehicles in the world.  \u0026ldquoWe want the UK to become the best country in the world in which to develop and manufacture zero-emission vehicles.  \u0026ldquoThe prize is not just a cleaner and healthier environment but a UK economy fit for the future and the chance to win a substantial slice of a market estimated to be worth up to \u0026pound7.6 trillion by 2050.  A study for motoring research charity the RAC Foundation found that growth in electric car use could be stalled by limitations in the public charging network.  The mass market appeal of ultra-green vehicles may be restricted without widespread, reliable and easy-to-use charging points, the report warned.  Separate AA research shows that eight out of 10 drivers see the lack of charging points as a stumbling block for them to buy an electric vehicle.  The motoring firm\u0026rsquos president Edmund King said: \u0026ldquoA big push on a range of slow, fast and rapid charging points should help overcome this hurdle.  \u0026ldquoThe challenge is then for manufacturers to make a car worth buying.  \u0026ldquoThese Road to Vision Zero proposals are a step in the right direction but there is still much to do to wean drivers off petrol and diesel cars."},{"url":null,"title":"what-we-know-about-the-amesbury-nerve-agent-emergency","story":"  The same type of chemical weapon was used in the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia\u0026nbspin Salisbury in March.  \u0026ndash What has happened?  Dawn Sturgess, 44, has died after being exposed to a nerve agent. Charlie Rowley, 45, who was also exposed to the nerve agent, is critically ill in hospital.  \u0026ndash How did they come into contact with the nerve agent?  Police have said they were exposed after touching a contaminated item with their hands.  \u0026ndash Have police found the item?  Not yet. On Sunday police said detectives were working \u0026ldquoas quickly and as diligently as possible to identify the source of the contamination, but this has not been established at this time.  \u0026ndash Have the authorities conclusively linked Amesbury to the Salisbury case?  Not yet, although the signs are that the investigation is moving in that direction. The possibility that the two investigations might be linked is \u0026ldquoclearly a key line of inquiry, Scotland Yard said.  \u0026ndash Was the nerve agent at the centre of the Amesbury alert the same type as the one used in Salisbury?  Yes, in both cases tests by Government experts detected Novichok, a highly potent nerve agent.  \u0026ndash Is the substance found in Amesbury from the same batch?

There is no evidence that they visited any of the sites decontaminated following the attempted murders of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March, according to investigators.  \u0026ndash Who was responsible for the Salisbury attack?  The UK Government has pointed the finger at the Russian government \u0026ndash an allegation the Kremlin denies.  \u0026ndash Has anyone been identified as a suspect in that case?  Not publicly.

It comes after Prime Minister Theresa May secured cabinet agreement for a compromise Brexit plan on Friday.  Mr Raab \u0026ndash who was previously housing minister \u0026ndash was a prominent Leave campaigner during 2016\u0026rsquos referendum.  A relatively unknown public figure, the\u0026nbsp44-year-old, who became an MP in 2010, is a surprise choice by Mrs\u0026nbspMay for one of the most important jobs in the UK Government.  The unexpected appointment could signal that the Prime Minister is hedging her bets against the possibility of someone else following Mr\u0026nbspDavis out of the door and that she would then have to find a senior colleague to fill a key role such as that of the Foreign Secretaryship.  Labour\u0026rsquos Keir Starmer said: \u0026ldquoDominic Raab\u0026rsquos appointment to the Brexit Department changes nothing.  \u0026ldquoThe deep division at the heart of the Conservative Party has broken out in public and plunged this Government into crisis.  \u0026ldquoIt is now clearer than ever that Theresa May does not have the authority to negotiate for Britain or deliver a Brexit deal that protects jobs and the economy, added the Shadow Brexit Secretary.  Explaining his resignation, Mr Davis warned the UK is giving \"too much away, too easily\" in the exit talks, but backed Mrs May to remain Prime Minister.  He said the Government had gone further than it should have in the negotiations, in a \"dangerous strategy\".  His decision to step down plunged Mrs May into a fresh leadership crisis and he was swiftly followed out of the Department for Exiting the EU by ally Steve Baker.  But Mr Davis said a leadership challenge would be the \"wrong thing to do\" and insisted he believed Mrs May was a \"good prime minister\".  Asked if she could survive, he replied: \"Oh yes, of course.\"  Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns said Mrs May\u0027s premiership was \"over\" but Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers, said he did not believe there would be an immediate challenge."},{"url":null,"title":"who-is-new-brexit-secretary-dominic-raab","story":"  Relatively unknown to the public, the 44-year-old was made a junior minister in 2015 under David Cameron, before returning to the backbenches when Theresa May took charge in the aftermath of the EU referendum.  Mrs May brought him back into Government last year, where he served as minister of state for courts and justice before being made housing minister in January.  He last hit the headlines just a few months later when his diary secretary was caught in an undercover sting selling sex on a website for \u0026ldquosugar daddies.  The 20-year-old aide told an undercover reporter she knew Mr Raab\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoevery move, raising fears she had left herself open to blackmail.  She also claimed her boss had the same Pret a Manger lunch every day without fail \u0026ndash a chicken Caesar and bacon baguette, superfruit pot and the vitamin volcano smoothie \u0026ndash dubbing it the \u0026ldquoDom Raab Special. Mr Raab later insisted this wasn\u0026rsquot true.  But the ardent Brexiteer is no stranger to controversy.  In a 2011 article for the website Politics Homes, he argued men were being flagrantly discriminated against, insisting: \u0026ldquoFeminists are now amongst the most obnoxious bigots.  The comment earned him a fierce rebuke from then Home Secretary Theresa May. She told the Commons: \"We should be trying to get away from gender warfare and the politics of difference \u0026ndash but I might suggest to him labelling feminists as obnoxious bigots is not the way forward to do that.\"  In 2012, Mr Raab joined other Tory rising stars in putting his name to a manifesto called Britannia Unchained, which raised eyebrows by branding the British \"among the worst idlers in the world\", insisting they \u0026ldquoprefer a lie-in to hard work.  And he provoked outcry again last year when he argued the \u0026ldquotypical user of a food bank is not someone that\u0027s languishing in poverty, it\u0027s someone who has a cash flow problem episodically\".  Previously David Davis\u0026rsquos chief of staff before being elected to parliament, Mr Raab\u0026rsquos background as a high-flying lawyer will come in useful for his new role.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not!

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766211.1531145313!/image/image.jpg","title":"new brexit minister criticised for comments on foodbanks and feminism","story":"        Theresa May\u0026#8217s newly appointed Secretary of State for Brexit Dominic Raab has immediately come under fire over comments he made on feminists and foodbanks.                 Dominic Raab, an ardent Brexiteer, was criticised for controversial comments he made while a Conservative backbencher, including a description as some feminists as ‘obnoxious bigots’.             The former civil servant and adviser is replacing David Davis as the UK’s chief negotiator on Brexit after his predecessor resigned in protest at the Government position laid out by Theresa May on Friday.             READ MORE: Dominic Raab appointed Brexit SecretaryMr Raab, the MP for Esher and Walton, was considered a shoo-in for almost immediate high office when he won the safe seat for the first time in 2010. His 2011 comments on feminism, however, earned him a swift rebuke from then-Home Secretary Theresa May, who said his comment on an ‘equality bandwagon’ was “not the way forward to get away from gender warfare.”He had claimed that men were the real victims of sexism in the piece for website Politics Home. In 2012, Mr Raab joined other Tory rising stars in putting his name to a manifesto called Britannia Unchained, which raised eyebrows by branding the British “among the worst idlers in the world”.            READ MORE: David Davis says UK is giving too much away in Brexit talksIn 2017, he was branded “offensive” by then Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron after telling a radio interviewer that “the typical user of a food bank is not someone that’s languishing in poverty, it’s someone who has a cash flow problem”.SNP MSP Linda Fabiani said: “Just when it seemed the Tories’ hard Brexit couldn’t get any worse, they’ve decided to appoint one of the most hard-right, toxic voices in their party as the lead negotiator.“Dominic Raab’s comments on women’s rights and worker’s rights, on foodbanks and on immigration are utterly disgraceful – not to mention his connection to voices calling for an end to all council housing, or his fierce advocacy of welfare cuts and policies such as the two child cap and rape clause.             “This Tory government, already the most right-wing in living memory, has lurched even further to the right with this appointment – it’s Thatcherism on steroids.”The Labour Party’s LGBT campaigning group tweeted: “As Dominic Raab is appointed as Brexit Secretary let’s not forget that this is a man who attempted to repeal the Human Rights Act and argued that feminism was bigotry. This Tory government cannot and must not be trusted with our rights after Brexit.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765906.1531125482!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith brexit no longer means brexit","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Theresa May has betrayed those 17.4 million who voted for Brexit with her latest plan, writes Brian Monteith                Well, does Brexit now mean Brexit? Does the Prime Minister’s Cabinet agreement on a negotiating position – more than two years after the British people voted to leave the European Union – amount to a craven capitulation or a triumph of pragmatism in the face of the EU’s intransigence?             The test must surely be to examine the proposal against what Theresa May has repeatedly told us, namely we shall be leaving the EU’s single market and customs union, we shall be controlling our own borders and we shall be free from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. In other words, by regaining full sovereignty the UK will take back control.            The press statement that summarised the Prime Minister’s proposal, which will form the basis of a White Paper, has been examined by barrister Martin Howe, QC, a respected specialist in European law and adviser to Lawyers for Britain – and it has been found seriously wanting.His 18-page advice can be found at their website and is well worth a read but the telling phrase is this: “These proposals [therefore] lead directly to a worst-of-all-worlds ‘Black Hole’ Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state in the EU’s legal and regulatory tar pit, still has to obey EU laws and ECJ rulings across vast areas, cannot develop an effective international trade policy or adapt our economy to take advantage of the freedom of Brexit, and has lost its vote and treaty veto rights as an EU member state.”• READ MORE: David Davis resignation plunges government into crisisTo achieve unanimity around her proposal, the Prime Minister connived against her colleagues who have repeatedly given her the benefit of the doubt only to find that decisions taken in good faith on issues such as the single market and customs union are consistently reopened to be debated again.Consider this: Mrs May flew to Germany to reveal her proposal to Chancellor Angela Merkel before she had presented it to her own Cabinet in an attempt to obtain pre-approval. It is generally held that the EU was also given wind of what she was proposing and was asked not to dismiss it out of hand before any negotiations.             The Cabinet members were then given the 120-page document to read individually only two hours before their meeting started and had their phones and watches taken off them so they could not communicate details of the contents or the meeting. Meanwhile, civil servants behind the plan were leaking details of the proceedings as if they were commenting gleefully on Eurovision Song Contest entries.That a Prime Minister should seek to cut a deal behind the backs of her own Cabinet betrays that she is not negotiating for the best deal from the EU but on the contrary, is negotiating together with the EU against Brexiteers in the Cabinet who represent the 17.4 million that voted Leave. If that is not treachery I don’t know what is. What we are heading for is not a soft Brexit, as its supporters are portraying it, but a soft Remain that will in time become a hard Remain – for it will undoubtedly result in further concessions. The Prime Minister’s Chequers agreement is only her opening gambit and, by the example of her performance thus far, must mean further concessions along the way.To consider what May has done let us look at it from a Scottish context. Imagine Scotland voted to leave the UK in a second independence referendum, but in the negotiations for a new relationship with the UK the SNP Cabinet is divided because some fear a soft Indyref will tie Scotland forever to decisions by UK institutions such as Westminster, the Bank of England and UK Supreme Court. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon quietly jets down to London, meets the UK Prime Minister of the day and reveals the plans she will present to her Scottish Cabinet before they are able to read it and agree to it. Sturgeon, with the promise of no more than murmurings from the UK that it is only a good starting-point, comes home and threatens the collapse of the government and an early election if she doesn’t get her way.            That is what May has done, and it is nothing short of treacherous to the decision that was taken on 23 June, 2016 by the British people – and it is not even the final settlement. No matter how sweet-sounding its initial reaction, the EU will bargain for more.  One has to conclude that if May had shown as much cunning and sharp practice towards the EU and Michel Barnier as she has shown to her Cabinet members then she would have undoubtedly have won greater support and loyalty from those who have put their faith in her, only to be betrayed.As is the way of politics I doubt we have heard the last of this shameful episode in the Conservative Party’s history. Too many are looking to their ministerial careers, their superannuated pensions, their limousine lifestyle and ambitions. David Davis was meant to be the minister for exiting the European Union but has become the doormat for the Prime Minister’s kitten heels. On Friday she trod all over him, again. Boris Johnson fires off smart-ass one-liners like torpedoes, but they have ultimately turned back and sunk him, for he is finished as an alternative to May if he can’t do a Heseltine and storm out. Meanwhile, Liam Fox is on a mission to irrelevance who will want to discuss trade deals in any serious fashion with him now? Michael Gove was apparently the first Leaver in Cabinet to support May’s plan if true then he has excelled himself as the most duplicitous of all having stabbed Boris Johnson in the back during the Tory leadership election on the basis he would not have delivered Brexit, he has now knifed the Brexit movement completely.            Left isolated, Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey have capitulated with their colleagues. Only a number of backbenchers, certainly too few if Labour backs May’s proposal, are wisening up to what it means.A Survation poll, carried out since the announcement, suddenly puts Labour ahead with the Tories dropping three points. It is only the beginning. The Cabinet may be united for the moment, but are all holding hands as they jump off an electoral cliff into that dark tarry black hole they are being warned about.• Brian Monteith is a director of Global Britain"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765653.1530992976!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm laws governing eu referendum proved meaningless","story":"        Without a criminal sanction or  the threat of a re-run, Vote Leave can cock a snook at the Electoral Commission, says Euan McColm                Imagine you’re unhappy with your television. The screen’s too small, the sound’s terrible and, frankly, nobody much enjoyed watching that last match round at your place.            There’s only one thing for it: you’re going to have to shell out a couple of grand on a new one.            Unfortunately, you’ve already spent the last of your savings on lottery tickets and artisan gin so the need for a TV simply cannot be met with the \u2028resources you have available. So what do you do?You could do the right thing and save a bit, maybe buy a new flat-screen next year, or you could, I suppose, stroll confidently into John Lewis, unhook a fancy Sony from the wall and march out with it under your arm.And, if a security guard stopped you by the front door, you could try explaining that it was the will of the people that you had a new TV.You wouldn’t do that, though, would you? There’s a law against you stealing things, even when you really, really want them. If you get caught in the act, you don’t get to keep your ill-gotten gains, you get to visit your local police station and you get to have a criminal record that might well ruin your life.Steal a referendum result, on the other hand, and – even if you get caught – you get to keep your winnings.            READ MORE: Official Brexit campaign ‘broke electoral law’Last week, the Vote Leave campaign, which celebrated victory in the 2016 EU referendum, leaked news that the Electoral Commission was set to find it breached electoral law during the Brexit referendum.In what appeared to be an effort to take back control of this particular story, this particular group of  Brexiteers let it be known that the commission had accused them of breaking their official spending limit of £7 million by passing donations to another campaign group – BeLeave – with which it was allegedly co-ordinating operations.If, indeed, Vote Leave did break electoral law during the campaign, one might be forgiven for expecting that there would be some pretty serious consequences.             After all, ignoring the law in order to win a referendum that will change the course of British history might be considered a more serious matter than half-inching a telly.If the law on spending limits – put in place (and here’s a laugh) to stop the wealthy simply buying victories – really meant anything, there would be police involvement. As it is, this piece of civil, rather than criminal, law is utterly worthless.The toughest sanction available to the electoral commission is the imposition of a fine of up to £20,000. To a millionaire campaigner willing to ignore the law, that might seem like very good value indeed.The spin from pro-Brexit politicians, campaigners, and commentators is that none of this had any impact on the result of the referendum a majority would have voted Leave, regardless of the amount any of the participants had spent. If this is so, one wonders why they felt the need to spend anything on the campaign at all.Remainers hoping that the Electoral Commission’s findings might have some impact on the result are to be disappointed.             It’s no wonder Vote Leave was so relaxed about revealing some of the detail of its own alleged misdeeds.But this scandal – and it is a bloody scandal, regardless of how it might be dismissed by the braying Brexiteers of Little England – should have consequences for future elections and referendums. It is time for spending on campaigns to be a matter of criminal rather than civil law.I fear, however, that we will see little appetite for this necessary change from the main political parties.It is an open secret that participants in elections regularly ignore the rules and regulations that are supposed to ensure financial fair play. As one campaigner put it to me last week: “We all do it and nobody wants to make an issue of it. If we start throwing accusations at our opponents, they’ll start throwing accusations at us. Everyone’s hands are dirty.”This cosy, all-in-the-sewer-together understanding makes a mockery of already toothless legislation surrounding spending limits.An especially bleak irony of the electoral commission’s findings, as leaked by Vote Leave, is that the Brexit campaign was driven by a populist message that departure from the EU would empower those who felt left behind by “political elites” or “the establishment” when the reality, it appears, is that the only people truly empowered by it are a financial elite whose contempt for the law (for what it is currently worth, which is nothing) is out there in the open, now, for all to see.When those who value “Britishness” talk about what it actually means, they will tell you that they pride themselves on our collective sense of fair play.If those Brexiteers who made so much about British values during the 2016 campaign truly meant what they say, they would be clamouring for a re-run of the referendum. A result obtained by murky means, with the law ignored, is surely fundamentally un-British, isn’t it?Anyone who dares to question the validity of a victory secured by a campaign that broke electoral law should expect to be dismissed as an out-of-touch “Remoaner”. The rag-bag of libertarians, right-wing obsessives, and downright racists who are currently pushing for Brexit at any cost will have their way.I can’t see any good reason that anyone – regardless of their political position – would oppose turning the regulation of campaign funding from a civil to a criminal matter. After all, don’t we all want to ensure the high standards politicians talk about to be a reality rather than just another bit of meaningless spin?The EU referendum result will have consequences for generations to come. Those who secured that victory may consider themselves very fortunate indeed that the law governing the way the referendum was conducted is meaningless."},{"url":null,"title":"leader comment brexit s true impact on our national health service","story":"        DURING 2016\u0026#8217s referendum on EU membership, those arguing most passionately in favour of a Leave vote were adamant that one of the main beneficiaries would be the National Health Service.                Without the need to pay for membership of the European club, went the argument, the UK could invest £350million-a-week in the NHS. Campaigners making this entirely dubious claim went so far as to emblazon it on the side of a bus, a cynical but effective move that helped perpetuate what The Scotsman regards as the myth that membership of the EU represented a drag on the UK economy.            The truth is that Brexit is set to have major impact on the health service but not in the positive way Leavers insisted.            It will not have escaped the attention of anyone who has used the NHS in recent years that it depends for the maintenance of acceptable standards upon the services of a great many staff who are not UK citizens.Uncertainty over the status of these staff post Brexit should be a matter of the gravest concern for us all.Gung-ho hardline Brexiteers may argue that the UK should walk away from the EU without any kind of deal. We believe this to be a dangerously reckless approach.A new report makes clear that a no-deal Brexit would impact on staffing not to just in hospitals but beyond.The social care sector - providing nursing and support services to the elderly and disabled in their own homes - currently employs 10,000 EU nationals in Scotland.            These staff are now living under a dark cloud of uncertainty while Eurosceptics across the political spectrum flex their muscles and demand that the “will of the people” be satisfied, no matter what.We do not believe it was the will of those people who voted Leave to bring the health and social care sectors to their knees.Prime Minister Theresa May has, in recent days, begun to show a little more steel in her dealings with the Eurosceptics in her party. While she is in this frame of mind, we hope she will take the necessary step of making clear that, whatever form Brexit takes, health and care workers who have devoted themselves to building careers here will be welcome to remain and that she will not prevent employers from bringing in more workers if necessary."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765145.1531123829!/image/image.jpg","title":"nick freer comment thinking outside the box to attract digital talent","story":"        I wrote last week about one of this country\u0026#8217s top venture capitalists and his view that in order to succeed in all things tech, we need an increasing pool of local digital and IT talent together with more senior managers experienced in global growth.                This stacks up with ScotlandIS’s annual survey which found that the local marketplace is anticipated to provide the bulk of new people talent, with 70 per cent of respondent companies expecting to recruit from within Scotland in 2018. No huge surprises here and a more interesting finding was around a marked increase in company demand for modern apprentices, with almost half of respondents saying they would recruit in this way.              Peter Proud, CEO and founder of Cortex Worldwide whose cloud-based technology platform includes Microsoft as a key client, says the group’s graduate apprenticeship scheme is “the second best thing we’ve done after founding the company.” Proud praises the work of ecosystem players like Skills Development Scotland (SDS) and Edinburgh Napier University to support further learning and employers, the overall engagement of the Scottish Government and says that the performance of Cortex’s graduate apprentices have “at least matched, in some cases exceeded” that of traditional university graduates. Cortex’s CEO, who will shortly take up a board position with ScotlandIS, also says his team is actively looking to hire from digital skills academy CodeClan over the next few weeks.              CodeClan deserves a special mention here, with around 600 people set to have graduated from its 16-week Professional Software Development Course by the end of the year. Key to CodeClan’s long-term success will be expanding the network of commercial and public sector employers who take on its graduates. George Elliott, Craneware’s chairman and a former Wolfson Microelectronics finance chief, reminded me last week not to forget about other skill sets: “It’s not just digital skills that we need but also commercial skills and knowledge of how to scale, market and sell the technology.” Elliott, whose track record of selling into the North American market during his time at Wolfson is nothing short of legendary, says we are better at this in Scotland than we were but we have to do more to compete effectively.   The CEO of one of Scotland’s most highly rated scale-ups, John Peebles of Administrate, says there is “a massive skills gap within the industry for people who are not engineers but have worked at large, scaling global tech start-ups. The skills shortage will become an acute choke point for the local tech industry within the next three years as local start-ups begin to mature.”Kelli Buchan, a highly rated technology recruitment specialist who has helped to build teams for fast-growth companies like Adminisrate, FanDuel, snap40 and pureLiFi, says: “Without a doubt Scotland, especially Edinburgh, has a thriving tech scene.“The opportunities in the digital sector are excellent and varied, for those who live here or those who move to work here. However, the biggest challenge in this sector is the fact that the competition between employers looking for talent is huge.            “There are simply not enough great candidates to fill the open roles which exist, especially in the start-up scene. From my experience with startups, recruitment is one of the last things they think about as they are so focused on building a product and securing funding.“When both are achieved, they then need to hire fast and the talent is so hard to find. The advice I always give to CEOs is to think and have your hiring plan in place at the very beginning so you do not lose out to competitors.”Susanne Mitschke, CEO and founder of MindMate, which develops apps to manage dementia from a headquarters in Glasgow with an investor base of US VCs, thinks Scotland has a very good standing when it comes to digital talent. Mitschke says: “We use the University of Glasgow’s recruitment system to find graduates and the quality has been fantastic. I see many other companies, in places like London, Berlin and the US who have trouble finding software developers, particularly affordable ones.”    In big news in Scotland’s informatics circles, David Richardson, currently director of partnerships at the University of Edinburgh’s soon to be opened Bayes Centre, is set to move to Heriot-Watt later this year to take up the position of chief entrepreneurial executive at the university’s new Discovery and Innovation Centre. Richardson says: “We have fantastic initiatives in Scotland focused on addressing the digital skills gap. Data science and cyber security are two of the hot areas right now and we need to continually work across industry, government and academia to help people upskill and retrain for the future.”             Overall, Richardson thinks Scotland’s report card reads well but says we could be doing more at primary and secondary level in order to start the “digital journey” even earlier.- Nick Freer is a founding director at the Freer Consultancy and Full Circle Partners"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say.

Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s

the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nMonday 9 Jul 2018 4:39

Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"}]
