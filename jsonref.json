They may be the most energy-efficient houses ever built in the UK. Could this be the start of proper social housing? Rows of glossy black tiles glisten in the afternoon sun, dripping down the facades like a neatly controlled oil slick. They cap a long row of milky brick houses, whose walls curve gently around the corners at the end of the street, dissolving into perforated brick balustrades, marking the presence of hidden rooftop patios. A planted alley runs between the backs of the terraced houses, dotted with communal tables and benches, where neighbours are sitting down to an outdoor meal.London-based architects Mikhail Riches and Cathy Hawley first won the competition for the site in 2008. The council’s intention had been to sell the site to a local housing provider, but these plans were scuppered by the financial crisis. In 2012, the city took the brave step of deciding to develop the site itself. It was a big risk: it hadn’t built homes for decades. Ever since the Tory government of the 1980s prevented councils from reinvesting funds from the sale of their council flats into building new housing, it had lacked the resources to do so. But, like a growing number of local authorities, Norwich found a way, using a mix of borrowing, funds from its housing revenue account, some right-to-buy receipts and council reserves.“It’s already won lots of awards, which is lovely, and other councils are really envious, but that’s not the point,” says Gail Harris, the Labour council’s deputy leader and cabinet member for social housing. “It’s about people having good quality homes and low fuel bills. And we plan to build a lot more.” In 2015, the city set up its own wholly owned housebuilding outfit, Norwich Regeneration Company, which has several other sites under way, and the council is planning to establish an additional fund to acquire sites and allow it to respond more quickly. In Goldsmith Street, the bar has been set high.The architects won the original competition because they were one of the few firms to propose streets, rather than slabs of apartment blocks. They took inspiration from the city’s Golden Triangle, a desirable neighbourhood of Victorian terraced houses. This provided a useful lesson on density: planning rules would usually require at least 21 metres between facing homes, to prevent overlooking, but these popular historic terraces were just 14 metres apart. The architects used the precedent to argue that this new neighbourhood could be just as humanely scaled, while fitting in more homes.The project might take its street width from the Victorians, but there is no pastiche. With generous windows, handsome brick details and bin stores cleverly hidden behind perforated bronzed screens, the homes are a smartly tailored arrival to the area of mostly postwar blocks of flats. Their rooftops are precisely angled to ensure that, even in winter, each terrace will not block sunlight from the windows of the row behind.David Mikhail, of Mikhail Riches, was initially apprehensive when the council suggested the Passivhaus route. “Most existing examples are pretty ugly: rendered boxes with small north-facing windows.” In the architecture world, Passivhaus is a byword for clunky boxes with fat rendered walls and tiny windows, representing a kind of socks-and-sandals, ironed hair-shirt approach to design. But Goldsmith Street shows that it doesn’t have to be so grim.“It’s onerous in a good way,” Mikhail admits, explaining how the homes had to undergo three airtightness tests during and after construction. “One pinprick in a membrane can destroy the whole thing. At one point, the builders had to go around with thermal imaging camera to find one small tear. There’s no cutting corners.” It means that heating bills should be just £150 a year, a boon when fuel poverty is a major issue.There are additional chance benefits, too. Passivhaus means windows have to be raised up around half a metre from the ground, which happens to be a good height for a little window seat. Other clever interior touches include an intelligent use of the space beneath the canted rooftops, where day-lit first-floor landings provide a space for a study nook, home office or play area, while the upstairs flats have been cleverly designed with interlocking stairs so that each has a door on to the street.It seems the only thing stopping Norwich, and other energetic councils, from doing more is central government rules. “There is a lot of rhetoric about needing more homes, but they should do more to help us,” says Harris. “They’ve lifted the borrowing cap, but we’re still losing a huge number of homes through right to buy.’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c4f3c99ac0a8b374045124f1a28722634a3afd4/0_365_5597_3360/master/5597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=070ea473cb09d9fafdf7e0840eeee7c8","title":"photographers beirut lebanese queer culture tattoos tans techno","story":"Ravers, semi-naked sun-worshippers, booming queer culture … we meet the photographers chronicling a new generation of Lebanese shaking off the trauma of civil war‘Parties are a privileged place, a space for exploration, a time for fusion,” says photographer Cha Gonzalez. They’re also the focus of her series Abandon, which looks at the way some Lebanese people have used nightlife – and techno music in particular – as a release after the trauma of the country’s 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990. “I knew a lot of people who were either born during the war or in exile,” she says. “What was put aside during the day came to light – and their internal struggles surfaced.”Abandon is a pertinent theme not only for Gonzalez, but for all of the 16 contributors to an exhibition in Paris called C’est Beyrouth (This Is Beirut), at the Institut des Cultures d’Islam. Gonzalez in particular seized on the city’s dance scene, and later continued the series in Paris, where she lives, because “there was something to say about countries that are very far from war as well. The war is inside us: how we feel useless, alone, bored, guilty, horny.”Photojournalist Hassan Ammar noticed a singular form of expression in Beirut’s Shia community. Ammar had been away from his native country but was back covering ceremonial Ashura – the 10th day of Muḥarram, the first month in the Islamic calendar – when he spotted a man with a shaved and inked head. “In a country like Lebanon, you don’t see people with a face tattoo,” he says.Over several months, he interviewed men at tattoo parlours as they etched images of Ali (disciple of the prophet Muhammad) and Hassan Nasrallah (the secretary-general of Hezbollah) into their skin. The men told Ammar that tattoos provided a way to express their solidarity with Hezbollah without carrying out extremist behaviour. Of the typical tattooed subject, Ammar says: “He’s not a fighter, he doesn’t hold guns or go to war, but his message is, ‘I’m not afraid.’” Ammar also points out, however, that they “don’t go to pray. Some are partying every night and dating … Their life is the opposite from that of religious people.”Patrick Baz documented a different kind of self-expression. His series Chrétiens du Liban casts a curious eye on Beirut’s Christian community, clustered on the city outskirts. Baz was a war correspondent for three decades until 2014, when PTSD led him to stop relentless newswire work. After that, he shifted to this series. “I was rediscovering my own country,” he says.In looking around with fresh eyes, this “very visual” presence and signage of the community stood in sharp contrast to “other communities that do not have such a theatrical approach to their religion”, he says, citing the more discretionary Shias, Sunnis and Druze among the country’s 18 recognised religious sects. The pageantry of iconography – tall crosses piercing the horizon line or the circulation of colossal Jesus statues – he documented are astonishingly cinematic,as if Fellini’s Roma had been transmuted into Middle Eastern set designs.French-born street photographer Vianney Le Caer’s series also boasts a larger-than-life vibe. He was working for an NGO in Lebanon, and during morning walks by Beirut’s Corniche became riveted by men he saw praying – between working out and tanning. Les Bronzeurs is a striking depiction of masculinity. “There was this element of Islam and nudity that was quite unique,” he says. “These men weren’t like anyone I’d seen before in the Middle East.” La Caer shot the series in 2015, at the height of the Islamic State’s power, and the fraternising of the Corniche crew provided a startling counterpoint, says Le Caer, to the fact that “two hours away from here, they’re beheading people and all these atrocities are being committed in the name of Islam”.His series proved somewhat controversial in the exhibition: masculine camaraderie in this state of undress has been interpreted in different ways. “The social codes are quite different there – as friends, brothers,” he says of the regional norms, “but for a western viewer, it has this homoerotic vibe.” (In 2016, the series won second prize at the Amsterdam-based Pride photo award.) The sexual orientation of his subjects is ultimately not his concern – “I really like the ambiguity,” Le Caer says. Although it is typical to see these men at the seaside, some Lebanese viewers were scandalised by the work’s inclusion and thought it was not appropriate to exhibit it.Ziad Antar’s Policemen series focuses on an easily identifiable trope: the uniform and its role in representing codes of power. He photographed about a dozen police officers alongside their motorcycles, inidually, in a studio. “I invited them formally – I went to the police station. They accepted, but I don’t know why,” he says. Antar chose to shoot his subjects at eye level, thwarting the tendency to shoot people in power from below.“In countries where there are conflicts, there are so many abnormalities with respect to violence and guns and how people respect the laws,” Antar says. “You have different criteria to respect the reality of the country.” Despite being a documentary series, the portraits could almost be from a kitschy TV casting shoot. Yet Antar is keen to stress that showing a perspective on a region is not a shorthand for understanding a culture. “You’re not showing the Arab world,” he cautions of exhibitions that focus on a particular place. Rather, he says, it’s a way to “show what artists from the Arab world are doing”.It’s this kind of thinking that motivated Sabyl Ghoussoub, who organised and curated the show, to shake up how Beirut is perceived or imagined, and to assemble the disparate communities he himself weaved between as an outsider (he was born in France but has been based in Beirut for many years). This exhibition provides a visual counterpoint to the headlines-only understanding of a territory, one that can be othering and reductive, and offers a more nuanced understanding of regional complexities.Indeed, the thematic spectrum of what local artists are exploring is growing more expansive, as exemplified by Mohamad Abdouni’s work. His series Doris \u0026amp Andrea spotlights a mother and son’s tender quotidian interactions over several weeks. The fact that Andrea is queer is incidental to their relationship. Abdouni is invested in chronicling not only the queer scene’s existence, but also its increasing wilfulness. “The community is less and less afraid. The law hasn’t changed – homosexuality is still illegal, crossdressing, regardless of sexual orientation, is still illegal – but we’re just more courageous, fed up. There’s a desire for expression, a desire for conversation, a desire for change.” He was delighted that this series is shown at an Islamic centre: it’s a powerful symbolic context. But while Abdouni has had a successful fashion photography career with global reach, working on fashion campaigns for Fendi and Gucci among others, his independent queer-focused projects have not yet been shown in his own city. “Attention is gathering from outside,” he says of the enthusiasm for Doris \u0026amp Andrea. “But I don’t think the work that I do is as important anywhere in the world as it is at home.”• C’est Beyrouth is at Institut des Cultures d’Islam, Paris, until 28 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aaeee4028a0e9a6bff4928d5bc12c37ae8755453/0_361_5463_3278/master/5463.jpg?width=1300\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=70b4c3e1d32fbc77615b962ec69a6f49 2600w","title":"search for british author of 50 year old message in a bottle washed up in australia","story":"South Australian man and his son found the bottle, which was dropped from an ocean liner by 13-year-old boy Paul Gilmore in 1969A South Australian man is trying to find the British author of a message in a bottle he found off the SA coast, 50 years after it was dropped into the ocean.Paul Elliot and his son Jyah told ABC radio they found the bottle on the Eyre Peninsula’s west coast recently while fishing.Elliot said he was looking for the author, Paul Gilmore, who described himself in the note as a 13-year-old English boy travelling on a ship along the southern Australian coast from Fremantle to Melbourne.The note is handwritten on paper with Sitmar Line’s company name at the top and is dated 17 November 1969.In it the teenager says he is travelling on board the Fairstar, a ship that brought many British migrants to Australia during the 1960s under the assisted passage scheme.The boy urges whoever finds the note to reply to him and gives an address in Melbourne.Oceanographer David Griffin said the bottle could not have remained afloat for 50 years off the south coast because “the ocean never stays still”.Griffin suspected that the bottle had been buried on a beach for years, then refloated by a storm.“If it had been dropped in anywhere in the ocean somewhere south of Australia, then there’s no way it’s going to stay actually at sea moving around for more than a year or two,” he told the ABC.The author gave his position as “1,000 miles east of Fremantle”.However, it is not clear whether the author actually meant 1,600 kilometres out of Fremantle, which would have included a journey south along the west coast before turning east.Last year, a West Australian woman found what is thought to be the world’s oldest message in a bottle.Tonya Illman found the 132-year-old gin bottle in the dunes near Wedge Island.

Who wrote in 2014 of Britain as “a nation of broken families clamouring about their entitlements siring ill-educated and undisciplined kids unfamiliar with the concept of right and wrong”? Who described with relish “the hulking fat tattooed chavmonkey standing in the queue at Burger King”? Who characterised the British masses as inhabiting “a dumbed-down culture”, being in thrall to “the background fugue of idiocy, the moronic inferno, of celebrity fuckstories”, and spending their time “watching TV, masturbating to pornography on the internet, getting drunk”? That would be Liddle in his last book, whose title, Selfish Whining Monkeys, may just possibly have had a slight whiff of contempt and vilification.But that was then, this is now. Liddle’s “chavmonkeys” have been redeemed by the Brexit referendum. Their “fugue of idiocy” is now a swelling symphony of reasserted sovereignty, their “dumbed-down culture” a fount of wisdom. The man who saw a “the moronic inferno” now champions the people against the “stereotype of the decrepit moron Leave voter”. For now, apparently, it is liberal remainers who commit the unforgivable sin of calling those voters stupid, “uneducated thickos” – and racists to boot. The evidence for this contention, as for everything else in Liddle’s polemic, is vanishingly thin. Yet the claim is central to his diagnosis of “a grotesque and unprecedented betrayal of the country” by the BBC, parliament, the judiciary, the civil service, Theresa May’s government and of course the “Irish spite” embodied in that “oily little shit”, the taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Liddle recalls that on the morning of the referendum result in 2016, he posted a one-line message on his Facebook page: “Betcha we don’t leave.” He now adds that he and his wife agreed that “they won’t let it happen”. Thus his narrative of Brexit betrayed is not a response to events since that (for him) glorious morning. It is the chronicle of a death foretold. And in a sense, this intuition of inevitable failure was quite right. Failure was baked in. The promise of a Brexit that delivered all the benefits of EU membership with none of the costs could not survive contact with reality. Brexit was not “betrayed”. It was dead on arrival.What makes Liddle’s book so dishonest is that he seems well aware of this, but persists with his pre‑prepared tale of treachery nonetheless. He accepts that Donald Tusk “had a point” when he spoke of a special place in hell for those who urged people to vote leave without having a plan for Brexit. He concedes that the leave campaign was “utterly lost” in the aftermath of its victory: “There was no sense of direction, no notion of a strategy, no notion as to how to proceed from here.” How can a non-existent project, one that is already “utterly lost”, be betrayed? Can a strategy that has never been created be thwarted by traitors?Tellingly, Liddle specifies the moment of perfidy. The conspiracy, as he sees it, began as soon as “the establishment” started talking about a “hard Brexit” and a “soft Brexit”, “whereas hitherto we had simply been talking about Brexit”. In other words, the betrayal started as soon as “Brexit” acquired any actual content. Once “Brexit means Brexit” became “Brexit means this or that”, it was being sold out. There is here a kind of truth – the pure, unbetrayed Brexit could exist only in the abstract. To give it concrete meaning was to sully it. Nowhere does Liddle ever tell us what he himself actually thinks Brexit means in the real world. How could he, since by his own definition that would be an act of betrayal?Of a piece is Liddle’s suggestion that Brexit was betrayed because its implementation was allowed to pass into the “hands of politicians … and away from the people who had voted”. How exactly does he think “the people who had voted” were supposed to negotiate the mutual rights of citizens, the orce bill, the UK-Ireland border and a vastly complex trade deal? Even conceding that the people who were, in Liddle’s pre-Brexit rantings, so sunk in idiocy five years ago, are now intellectual giants, how might this process be managed? Might the people, perhaps, elect delegates to some kind of representative assembly which in turn would choose an executive?Liddle is as untroubled by facts as by logic. He repeatedly cites the figure of £9bn as the UK’s annual net contribution to the EU – it is £7.9bn. The House of Commons library report of 24 June on the net contribution says the £9bn does not take account of EU funds given to non governmental agencies in the UK (universities and so on). He thinks Ireland was “forced” by the EU to hold another referendum on the Nice treaty in 2001 – it wasn’t. He thinks the DUP speaks for “the Northern Irish”, even though it gets a third of the vote and does not represent the strongly anti-Brexit majority. He claims Britain could have negotiated a trade deal with the EU before it discussed a withdrawal agreement, even though the EU can’t do a trade deal with Britain until it has actually left. His understanding of the border question – blockchain can solve “almost all” the problems – is childish. He even seems oblivious to the basic history of the UK: “Our boundaries have not shifted much over the years.” (So Ireland neither joined the UK in 1801 nor left it in 1922?)At the heart of Liddle’s new pose as defender of the people is his righteous rage against “the allegations that Leave voters were all racists”. His only actual source for this “allegation” is Diane Abbott, who Liddle quotes as saying that “people who intended voting Leave ‘want to see less foreign-looking people on their streets’”. Abbott did not say this about people who intended to vote leave. She said it on Question Time in April 2017, long after the vote. She did not say it about leave voters as a whole – she actually said: “The people that complain about the freedom of movement will not be satisfied because what they really want is to see less foreign-looking people on their streets.” And she also added that she would “never say that people voted to come out because they were racist”. This is the sole foundation for Liddle’s core argument.Equally disingenuous, though, is his contention that racism and xenophobia played no role at all in the leave vote. The grossly misleading posters showing brown-skin hordes supposedly queueing to get into the EU were “a matter of taste rather than accuracy”. He acknowledges that the use by the official leave campaign of Turkey’s allegedly imminent membership of the EU was “a little bit speculative”. But, he adds, it did not affect “a single vote, apart maybe from some Kurds”. He does not tell us how he knows this or whether he has explained to Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings how they wasted so much money and effort in appealing to a non-existent xenophobia.It is just as well that it does not exist. If it did, people might misunderstand the benign nature of Liddle’s questions about whether immigrants can have proper feelings for “the nation”: “If you are a fairly recent arrival in this country, does its long existence as a nation state matter very much to you? Do you have a stake in our history? Is the UK’s history as an independent country as impinging as it might be on someone whose family has lived here for countless generations?” He insists on giving one despised anti-Brexit campaigner her full name: “Gina Miller, née Singh” though he never refers, for example, to “Theresa May, née Brasier”. Otherwise readers might not realise that beneath Miller’s English-sounding name lurks a woman with no stake in “our” history. Here we face the underlying toxicity of the myth of betrayal. Without the treachery of those who do not belong to “us”, Brexit would always have been wonderful. Since it is not, we know who to blame.• The Great Betrayal is published by Constable (£14.99).

For many of us, this is a pattern that never fitted, and though we did the urban thing to burst (or tiptoe) from the closet, the lure of the rural soon overwhelmed the anonymity of the city. It didn’t feel like a choice, but something intrinsic that would have been dangerous to resist, like the act of coming out itself.So it was for George Walton and Reg Mickisch, an elegant couple who met in the postwar rubble of London, and in 1972 headed for the sticks, opening a B\u0026ampB in a tiny mid-Wales village. They became much-loved members of our thinly scattered community, and great friends. When they died within a few weeks of each other in 2011, aged 94 and 84, my boyfriend and I found that they had left us their old farmhouse. In us, they saw themselves, and the feeling was mutual. Their legacy was far greater than that though, for it included an archive of letters, diaries, photos, art and books that told a remarkable story. My book On the Red Hill is that story – and so many others.In researching it, I read widely around the topic of the “queer rural”. There wasn’t much, at least not explicitly so. Even more than is normally the case with LGBT+ history, that meant learning to read the shadows, to spot fragmentary connections that had previously been denied or ignored. The truth was clear: we are not newcomers to the countryside. We’ve always been here. In Wales, there is a long tradition of yr hen lanc (literally “the old lad”), the unmarried uncle who might live with, or next door to, his equally unmarried friend. Every village had its hen lanc, and his female equivalents too.These are some of the books that chimed most sonorously in my research. The queer rural is a small but growing canon, and I’m thrilled to be part of it.1. Maurice by EM ForsterThe gay grand-daddy of them all, Forster’s elegant love story was written in 1913, but – for fear of scandal – remained unpublished until his death 60 years later. Maurice and gamekeeper Scudder’s passion is ignited in the pillowy folds of a rural English landscape, a place of both beauty and danger. For middle-aged gay men like me, the 1987 film adaptation was a huge catalyst in our coming out – and surprisingly sexy, too, for a Merchant Ivory number. “Men of my sort could take to the greenwood,” sighs the eponymous hero we all sighed with him.2. Conundrum by Jan MorrisThe groundbreaking 1974 memoir of her transgender journey is a masterpiece from the greatest literary traveller of our age. There is a literal journey, its apex on a surgeon’s table in Casablanca, but an existential and spiritual one, too, that brings her back to the only place that can possibly heal her, “the profoundly civilised society of Caernarfonshire”, in Wales’s rocky north-west corner. And there she is still, well into her 10th decade.3. Edward Carpenter: A Life of Liberty and Love by Sheila RowbothamIn truth, the copious written works of early socialist Edward Carpenter (1844 – 1929) have not aged too well. More inspiring is this superb biography of the man himself, and especially of the decades he spent living quite openly with his lover George Merrill in the village of Millthorpe, south of Sheffield. Pilgrims came from far and wide, including EM Forster, who credited a bottom-squeeze from Merrill as the thing that freed him – it “touched a creative spring” – to write Maurice.4. Stripping Penguins Bare by Michael CarsonIn the second book of the Benson trilogy, set in the mid-1960s, our upright hero leaves Merseyside for university in Aberystwyth. There, he fights prejudice on behalf of the Overseas Students’ Society, while pining unrequitedly for one of its members. He has more luck with taciturn Welsh farmers, who happily deflower him in the wild west.5. Fingersmith by Sarah WatersBriar House, fog-bound in the Victorian English countryside, is the claustrophobic setting for this arch lesbian mystery story. At Briar, darkness and quiet rule, time moves differently and ordinary rules are upended. For all its clamminess, Briar insinuates itself into the hearts of the two women whose passion is ignited there. Though this countryside is heavy with secrets, it is only there that they can be themselves, and be together.6. On the Black Hill by Bruce ChatwinThe furzy Welsh-English borderland is the backdrop – and chief protagonist – of this epic saga of farmer twins Lewis and Benjamin Jones. Benjamin is not the marrying kind, and Lewis gives up his own hopes of marital fulfilment to stay with him, sharing a bedroom that was “always dark, and smelled of lavender and mothballs”. In many ways, the twins represent Chatwin’s own bisexuality, and the farm bisected by the border his equally ided sense of where he felt he belonged.7. Modern Nature by Derek JarmanA place of pilgrimage for all queer ruralists is Dungeness, that otherworldly protuberance from England’s south coast and home, for his final years, to Jarman. At Prospect Cottage, he cultivated a garden as strange and spiky as its surroundings, the backdrop of a nuclear power station only augmenting its bleak allure. One unique property of Dungeness is its lack of fences “my garden’s boundaries are the horizon” wrote Jarman in this passionate evocation of finding the wonder in wilderness.8. A Place Called Winter by Patrick GaleA muscular tale of escaping shame and demons in Edwardian England by becoming a prairie settler in Canada. The joyous Francis Lee film God’s Own Country was not, as many lazy reviewers had it, a British Brokeback Mountain. This is. The lesbian equivalent, a book that has bewitched its fans for 50 years, is Isabel Miller’s Patience and Sarah, the tale of two women who take on a farm in upstate New York at the beginning of the 19th century. We all need our cowboygirl stories.9. Blossom at the Mention of Your Name by Fiona CooperA book that shone a piercing light ahead for me when I first read it 25 years ago. I ached to be – or perhaps to be with – its central character, an elfin queer witch by the name of Callum. His connection to the green fuse of nature, so fulsomely explored and flamboyantly described, is a force that thrilled me, and only sharpened my hunger to get out of the city.10. Sacred Country by Rose TremainRural Suffolk in the 1950s was not the ideal time or place to be trans. Mary is six when she first realises that she is a boy, a growing understanding that propels him to sanctuary in London and then to Nashville, where he can live as Martin. Though this might seem like the standard queer “escape from the country” narrative, Martin can never quite shake off Suffolk village life, nor does he really want to. On boarding a Greyhound bus in Tennessee, the driver asks him where he wants to go. “Fields,” he replies.• On the Red Hill by Mike Parker is published by William Heinemann.

We are watching and we will continue to watch very carefully Northern’s performance in all respects, and I expect them to deliver on what they have committed to deliver. It hasn’t been good enough up to now.”The government has faced repeated calls to strip the franchise from Northern, which is ultimately owned by the German state-owned company Deutsche Bahn.In May, the mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool city region called for the franchise to be terminated, saying they had received assurances that services would have improved by then.Grayling, who was appointed as transport secretary by Theresa May after the EU referendum three years ago, acknowledged: “Fundamentally the infrastructure in the north is not up to handling the needs of a modern commuter railway, and that’s what it needs to be.”It is unclear whether Grayling will still be serving as transport secretary by the end of the month under a new prime minister. Grayling, who backed the leave campaign, was an early supporter of Boris Johnson, the bookmakers’ favourite to win the vote of Conservative party members.Grayling has faced repeated calls for his resignation during his tenure, including after a controversy over a £33m out-of-court settlement paid to Eurotunnel. The Department for Transport was sued by Eurotunnel for allegedly breaching public procurement rules over a contract with the ferry leasing company Seaborne Freight and two other ferry firms to provide freight capacity for emergency medical supplies in the event of no Brexit deal.Grayling, who favours leaving the EU without a deal if there is no trade agreement, said he had been in favour of fighting the action, but that he was overruled by a cabinet subcommittee who worried that the NHS would run out of vital medicines.“Although we would have liked to fight that case in court, we collectively decided that we could not jeopardise the supply of goods to the NHS, which is why we settled,” he said.Northern has been contacted for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45acf4ec75a8bd5b99958ba66b511f05f687f14e/666_292_4902_2941/master/4902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3619aa0d1c814b3b42ea26d3c16f556b","title":"pro europe tories remain no deal brexit","story":"As more leading Tories soften on no deal for the sake of their careers, principled moderates have only one option leftIf hardline Brexiteers were free to shop around for beatable enemies they probably wouldn’t change much about the current state of British politics. Their preferred candidate is well ahead in the final straight of a Tory leadership contest, and his rival doesn’t dare to contradict him on the issue that matters most.In hustings on Monday night, Boris Johnson ruled out any Brexit compromise based on revision of the Northern Irish backstop. And that is the only route to a negotiated, orderly resolution visible from Brussels. No backstop no deal. Jeremy Hunt might have inserted some practical reality into the conversation, if only for the sake of his intellectual credibility, but instead he endorsed the central tenet of Johnsonism: the only Brexit deal worth aiming for is one that doesn’t exist.It is not news that dignity is soluble in ambition. Hunt, like Matt Hancock and Amber Rudd, has examined the price of a seat at Johnson’s cabinet table and decided he is willing to pay. Others who served under Theresa May, and who understand what leaving the EU in a disreputable huff would cost the country, have made a different choice, preferring integrity on the back benches. The resistance to a no-deal Brexit will soon be bolstered by ministerial veterans – the likes of David Gauke, David Lidington and Philip Hammond.Even with heavyweight reinforcements, the Tory moderates do not intimidate the zealots. Pro-Europeans in the Commons have been adept in the use of procedural subterfuge against a no-deal Brexit, but that arcane combat does little to advance arguments for alignment with continental allies. One thing it has achieved is Eurosceptic radicalisation, sustaining tales of Westminster conspiracy against national liberation.Moderate Tories have won skirmishes over the legislative timetable and lost the battle for their party’s soul. One reason is their culture of obedience. The insurgent spirit does not come easily to these natural parliamentary prefects, who sit at the front of the class, waiting to be picked by teacher. The Eurosceptics have the temperament of troublemakers, sitting at the back.A greater problem still is lack of clarity among pro-European Tories about what they are really fighting for. There is a large number of Brexit Mensheviks – MPs who accept the referendum result but draw a line at the destructive revolutionary fervour of Ukip-style Bolshevism. They voted for May’s withdrawal agreement. They were in favour of “soft” options before the party’s centre of gravity shifted towards the hardliners. Then they ended up taking the view that any deal would be better than no deal. Their candidate in the leadership contest was Rory Stewart, who was lauded for supporting Brexit with body language hinting that he understood it to be a stupid idea. That stance is no longer available. What the Mensheviks call pragmatism, the Bolsheviks call enslavement to Brussels.There are queasy leavers on the Labour side too – MPs who like nothing about Brexit but would rather go through with it than explain to constituents why it shouldn’t happen. More avowedly pro-European Labour MPs have focused on nudging their reluctant leader towards a second referendum – a strategy that has muddled up means and ends. No one who likes Brexit wants another vote, so the only point of the thing would be to remain, and Jeremy Corbyn struggled to be enthusiastic about that the first time. Inordinate amounts of energy seem to have been wasted trying to persuade a man who doesn’t like the European project to give his party permission to run a campaign in which he would inevitably take a surly back-seat role.Pro-European voices in the main opposition party have been muted. In the governing party they have been suffocated. That has allowed the Liberal Democrats to emerge as a confidently anti-Brexit party, foil to Nigel Farage’s Brexit party. But that apparent symmetry creates a false equivalence between two polarised positions. The Lib Dems find themselves cast as “ultra-remainers”, as if aborting Brexit is a notion as extreme as Farage’s ambition to burn every bridge to the continent. The fallacy is exposed by imagining the morning after each side gets their way. In the remain scenario, the state functions as before, undisturbed. In the no-deal scenario there is frantic, costly execution of contingency plans and, if they fail, pandemonium.That is not to deny the political cost of staying in the EU. There would be a heavy penalty in trust among leavers who already feel their democratic will is despised. That price is so high in part because Brexiteers ramp it up, knowing it is their only argument for proceeding with a project that has no economic justifications left. On any technical, legal, financial basis, keeping our current EU deal is by a mile the easiest way out of the mess we are in.If remaining feels like an extreme measure, that is because even pro-European politicians have been extremely reluctant to admit that it is an available option, let alone make the case. But their other options are running out. The strategy of dilution has failed. The hardliners see no distinction between compromise and betrayal between efforts to avoid no deal and plots to stop Brexit. That could be liberating for Tory dissenters who feel unable to climb aboard the Johnson bandwagon. They will be cast as remainers anyway, so perhaps they should finally clear their throats and make the case for remain."},{"url":null,"title":"housing britain landlord tenants","story":"Britain has enough housing – it’s just that a series of outrageous policies makes it accessible only to the richI have a friend who works almost every waking hour, mainly to pay the rent. Her landlord lives on a beach, 4,000 miles away. He seldom responds to her requests, and grudgingly pays for the minimum of maintenance. But every so often he writes to inform her that he is raising the rent. He does not have to work because she and other tenants work on his behalf. He is able to live the life of his choice because they give their time to him. As there is a shortage of accessible housing, they have no choice but to pay his exorbitant fees.The effects are devastating not only for people’s finances but also for their family life and peace of mind, as Catrina Davies reminds us in her beautiful, elegaic book Homesick, published this month. After a childhood clouded by her father’s bankruptcy, the subsequent loss of the family home, destitution, orce, chaos and mental illness, she finds herself on the wrong side of the magic line between those who own and those who don’t. She is engaged in an endless struggle to lead a good, fulfilling life, without being crushed by the demands of rent.After living in a tent, a van and a static caravan, she rents a tiny box room in a crowded, angry house in Bristol for £400 a month. While she struggles to meet her bills, her landlords blithely travel the world. Eventually, it all becomes too much. She flees into a collapsing shed in Cornwall, without planning permission, electricity or water. She now lives on the wrong side of the law, under corrugated iron and decaying timber, in extreme precarity, but with a measure of freedom she has not been able to find elsewhere.She is surrounded by the dysfunctions of Britain’s property market. A miserable, pokey flat comes up, but there are no available jobs that could possibly cover the rent. Buying is impossible: the average price of a house in Cornwall is £206,000, while the average wage in the county would permit her to borrow £51,000.Davies encounters an almost feudal economy, in which non-owners work for the owners. Some of the employers – offering casualised work at the minimum wage cleaning and servicing holiday homes and staffing cafes and car parks – are also the local landlords, who set rents their own workers cannot afford. The economy is sustained by people living in tents, vans and caravans. She notes that “basic needs can be satisfied very cheaply when you don’t have a landlord to support”. But landlords have become punitively expensive to maintain.The folk theory of crazy rents and mortgages is that they are the result of too few houses and too many people. But one of the amazing facts of our time is that the UK has more bedrooms per person than ever before. Throughout the boom in house prices, the number of dwellings here has been growing faster than the number of households. There is plenty of housing – for the rich. But a series of outrageous policies ensure that it remains inaccessible to the poor. There are council tax discounts for second homes and holiday homes, and for single people in large houses. The capital gains tax on second homes and investment properties is lower than income tax. Why work if your extra homes earn more than you do – even if they are left empty?We will need private landlords for the foreseeable future, and they should be able to make some money from their property. But they cannot be allowed to use their position as owners of a limited and non-reproducible resource (the land on which their houses sit) to extract private taxes from people much poorer than themselves. We claim to be a nation that values freedom. But freedom is currently the preserve of the rich."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cce4835053a3973f76fb78f292c96514193d218/0_81_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=337e50f44d907790dfd1194363d42b0a","title":"number of small schools in england halves since 1980","story":"Rise of ‘super-jumbo’ primaries leaves villages mourning loss of community assetThe number of small schools in England has halved in recent decades, with those in rural and village settings twice as likely to have shut their doors as those in urban areas, according to research.The study says primary schools have undergone a dramatic transformation, with children increasingly being taught in “super-jumbo” institutions in towns and cities, many with more than 800 pupils, leaving villages to mourn the loss of a vital community asset.According to data from the House of Commons library, there were almost 11,500 small primary schools in England with 200 or fewer pupils in 1980, but by 2018 the number plummeted to fewer than 5,500.Over the same period, the number of primary schools with more than 600 pupils has increased from about 50 to 780 and there are now more than 100 primaries with more than 800 pupils.The same trend is echoed in Scotland and Wales. In 1985, there were more than 1,300 small primary schools with 200 or fewer pupils in Wales, but by 2017 the number had declined to fewer than 650. In Scotland, the number of small schools decreased by almost a fifth between 2002 and 2018, while the number of large schools with more than 400 pupils have tripled since 2002.The largest proportional declines in the number of small schools were in Wales, the north-west, and Yorkshire and the Humber, while the smallest declines have been in the the south-west, east Midlands and London, according to the study by the Conservative thinktank Onward.“With no discussion or public debate, a dramatic transformation has come over our schools in recent decades,” said the Tory MP and author of the report, Neil O’Brien. “Small schools and village schools have been in dramatic decline, and more and more small children are attending really huge schools.“Many people will feel uneasy about these trends towards large-scale institutions for very young children, because they regard small schools as a more human scale for the very young. Others will be concerned about the effect on community life or on commuting times and congestion.“Village schools are often much-loved institutions, at the heart of their community, places where the community gathers for special occasions, where people meet new friends, and community life gets organised. A village loses a lot when it loses its school.”Funding is the key issue facing small schools, with fewer pupils meaning less income. O’Brien said the government’s new national funding formula was an improvement, but complained that a lump sum aimed at protecting small schools had been cut. “The next PM must reverse this and back our small schools,” he added.A Department for Education spokesperson responded: “We recognise the importance of rural schools, the role they play in their communities and the circumstances they face. That is why the national funding formula allocates additional funding of £25m specifically for small and remote schools.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1ff02b1a29f108a59035f299cb8b8bb7c504dc6/0_0_6673_4004/master/6673.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce7937919ee4b927ddb034665d422de6","title":"flapping about swan upping on the thames","story":"Annual counting ceremony dates back to the 12th century when the crown claimed ownership of all mute swans"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c07e3411275ed722b8af8edeab797558ae28d779/3_0_10661_6400/master/10661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae8956563200dcf25722adb1824d4b95","title":"how the wig got big katy perry cardi b summer trend","story":"They are loved by celebrities from Katy Perry to Cardi B, are all over the catwalks and selling out fast on the high street. Is this the summer’s most hair-raising trend?Outside of the the black community, wig-wearing in popular culture has traditionally fallen into two camps: fancy dress or hair-loss solution. Occasionally, celebrities have flirted with wigs to define their look – Tina Turner or Cher – but whispers of “it’s a wig” are not often positive. That, however, is beginning to change.Last month, Paris Hilton revealed she has a collection of more than 800 wigs, albeit some of which she uses for going “undercover”. During this month’s Wireless festival, Cardi B removed her wig and threw it into the crowd, before requesting its return on Instagram. Katy Perry took to Instagram to remove a bouncy blond wig, revealing longer, blonder hair beneath (also thought to be a wig). Kylie Jenner, who, like the rest of the Kardashian clan, is best known for sporting long, dark locks, opted for a short, blond wig with a fringe on a highly publicised night out. And it’s not long, of course, since Jenner wore a lengthy, purple, mermaid-esque wig that matched her dress to this year’s Met Gala (three years after she claimed to have started the wig trend, to much derision). The first trailer for the forthcoming Charlie’s Angels film was so wig-filled that, in less than 24 hours, New York magazine’s style pages ran  a wigtastic roundup.On the catwalk, too, hairpieces are stepping out of the shadows: Martine Rose’s springsummer 2020 menswear show placed almost every model in a wig, many with their natural hair poking out from beneath. The designer cited the London club night Kinky Gerlinky as an inspiration for the show’s hair and makeup, as well as the event’s exploration of gender politics.Paria Farzaneh sent models out in identical brunette bobbed wigs for a show titled Virtue Signalling. When asked why she had opted to turn models into an army of clones, Farzaneh said: “It’s about who’s underneath.” According to the SS19 shows, wigs will be big this summer: Andreas Kronthaler for Vivienne Westwood put models in towering two-tone creations, while Asai’s show for Fashion East featured more naturalistic wigs in two colours, worn by all models.At Urban Outfitters’ online store, wigs in pink, purple and blue have all sold out. At Selfridges, the HotHair concession stocks a range of human and synthetic hair wigs, priced from £115 to £995.“The effect of celebrities such as the Kardashians openly wearing wigs has meant we have seen an upturn in wearers who want to wear them for fun, to change their look for an event or just for a night out,” says the HotHair marketing manager Louise Cayzer. “We also specialise in wigs for hair loss, especially for people affected by alopecia or chemotherapy treatment. I think one of the nicest things about the recent interest in wigs is that it normalises wearing them, which means we can offer a better selection of fun, fashion styles.”The global wigs and hair extensions market is predicted to reach a value of $10bn (£7.9bn) by 2023. “Wearing wigs has grown in popularity because people have the desire to change their hairstyles as a way to reflect their own iniduality, – whenever, wherever,” says the hairstylist Akki Shirakawa, who has worked with fashion houses including Saint Laurent and Versace, as well as Lady Gaga. “Instagram has become this amazing platform to source inspiration.”It’s true that images of wigs – from the fantastical to the more natural – abound online, with an Instagram search of #wig prompting more than five million results.“There’s a huge wig community on Instagram,” says Emily James, a 23-year-old social media manager, who often posts images of herself wearing wigs online and has since started modelling for Lush Wigs. “I tend to go for styles I’d never dare experiment with on my own hair I absolutely love being able to get pastel shades without bleaching, and then deciding the next day that I want to go straight to dark brunette. It’s impossible to have a bad-hair day with wigs. From what I’ve seen, they’re definitely becoming more mainstream, particularly with so many influencers wearing wigs now.”Such influencers are often criticised for feeding into the culture of throwaway fashion and promoting the idea that an outfit should only be worn – and more importantly, photographed – once. Wigs, then, are another way for iniduals to change their look and keep followers interested – although no doubt some wigs will also fall victim to the “wear it once” approach.However, Akki does credit Instagram with breaking down “so many of the stigmas that may have previously existed in fashion and beauty, especially for wigs”. Wig wearing is no longer secret or subtle, but lauded as a means of being fashion-forward. The wig maker César DeLeön Ramirêz, who has worked on wigs for Jenner and Ciara, says that negative associations – such as the taboo of female baldness – are long gone: “I wanted to diminish the stigmas that surrounded wig wearing. People are now open to wearing wigs because it has become another accessory, a statement piece and the alternative to a permanent change.”The fashion psychologist and avid wig-wearer Dawnn Karen agrees that wigs have “become more acceptable and less taboo. There are tons of tutorials online – how to secure your wig, how to care for your wig, how to create a wig. Black women already wear wigs, it’s commonplace within our culture. Also, the LGBTQIA community – particularly transgender women – have made wigs more acceptable.”“For most trans men, a wig is not necessary, but for most trans women – especially those above a certain age – a wig is essential,” says Dr Jane Hamlin, president of the Beaumont Society, a national self-help body run by and for the transgender community. “Several wig suppliers advertise in our members’ magazine and some attend events that are organised for the trans community, so that people can try them in an environment where they feel safe. When I started, I relied on mail order and bought wigs that were probably not the best choices for me.”Ramirêz recognises that the growing popularity of wigs comes at a time when the natural hair movement has encouraged many women with afro locks to embrace their curls. Yet he is also keen to stress that the two trends can sit side by side.“Wigs were originally a form of protective hairstyling that allows natural hair to grow while avoiding heat or chemical damage,” he says. “It’s a temporary shield for someone in the natural hair movement.”Drag acts, too, have had a role to play. Although drag errs towards the “costume” end of the wig-wearing spectrum, it has also placed wigs and their aesthetic potential firmly in the spotlight. On the TV show RuPaul’s Drag Race, the “wig reveal” – where a drag queen deliberately removes her wig as part of the performance – has become a recurring feature. It’s a motif that has also cropped up elsewhere in pop culture, from series two of Killing Eve to films including The Perfection and In Fabric despite the mainstream acceptance, wig removal is still a popular trope within the horror and thriller genres.The rise in popularity may also be down the fact that wigs have much improved in recent years.Wigs and Warpaint offers a wig-fitting service and gets between five and 10 requests every week, with those who are tapping into the trend (rather than wearing a wig due to hair loss) most likely to opt for more affordable, monofibre options, rather than real hair.The danger is that makers of wigs comprising real human hair may exploit those who provide it by either forcing them to cut their hair or not providing fair payment in return. Synthetic alternatives avoid this problem and are usually less costly, but cannot be heat-styled. They also have environmental implications – they tend to be made from plastic fibres such as polyester, acrylic or polyvinyl, which are not recyclable and are usually nonbiodegradable.Despite these concerns, the fashion psychologist Shakaila Forbes-Bell believes the versatility afforded by wigs is one of the main reasons why they have become increasingly mainstream.“Studies have shown that novel things, like a new hair colour or length, for example, activate the brain’s pleasure centres, resulting in a flood of dopamine – the same chemical that is released when we eat good food and have great sex,” she says.Wigs, then, offer a certain escapism a chance to achieve the aesthetically unlikely or impossible. While awareness has increased around conditions such as alopecia, so too have the opportunities afforded by wigs as a fashion accessory. Karen cites wigs as a means of “mood-enhancement dressing” – where clothes (or in this case, hairpieces) optimise the mood of the wearer. Now that wearing a wig is no longer imbued with the same sense of shame at the possibility of being “found out”, it can be an exhilarating experience, the chance to try different styles, and maybe even take on a more daring – albeit temporary – persona.“There’s a reason why many of us take a trip to the salon after a devastating breakup,” says Forbes-Bell. “A wig is even more appealing, as it allows you to experience that euphoric novelty, without having to plop yourself in a stylist’s chair for two hours.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00df6328b1d8177f5aebfe35b9147a856237a538/0_3172_6861_4115/master/6861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e0e07fff122afccc08f4022e24e2ff8","title":"felicity cloake masterclass salade nicoise recipe","story":"Outside the French Riviera, inauthentic versions of salade niçoise abound, much to the chagrin of purists. Here’s the classic French salad as it is meant to be madeIf salade niçoise were sentient, rather than a salad, it would sue for defamation of character, such are the abuses heaped upon it in the name of culinary innovation. Indeed, one of Nice’s most notorious sons, former mayor Jacques Médecin, wrote of the trauma of seeing ‘the remains of other people’s meals being served under the name salade niçoise’.

Bring slowly to a boil over a medium heat, then turn down the heat slightly and simmer gently for seven and a half minutes. Drain the water from the eggs and put them in cold water to stop them cooking further.Pop the broad beans from their pods, then peel off their papery skins (unless they’re very young, in which case you can leave them on). If you’d prefer to use French beans instead, bring a pan of salted water to a boil, simmer them for a couple of minutes until just tender, then decant into a sink of cold water to stop them cooking. Dry before use.Put the tomatoes in a pan of boiling water for 30 seconds, then scoop out and, once cool enough to handle, gently peel off their skins – if they haven’t split in the heat, use your fingernail or the tip of a small, sharp knife to help tease off enough to get started. Cut in half, scoop out and discard the seeds, then cut the flesh into thick slices.Peel the cucumber (I like to do this in stripes, but then I like stripes on everything), cut it in half lengthways, then scoop out and discard the seeds. Cut the cucumber into chunky half-moons. Finely chop the spring onions. Deseed the pepper and cut it into fairly thin strips.Put the peeled garlic clove into a mortar with a pinch of coarse salt, then mash to a paste. Add the anchovies – if they’ve been packed in salt, rather than oil, you’ll need to give them a quick rinse first – and mash them, followed by the basil. Finally, incorporate the vinegar and then the olive oil until well emulsified. Season to taste.Toss the beans, sliced tomatoes, cucumber, spring onion and red pepper in a large bowl with two-thirds of the dressing, until everything is thoroughly coated. Using your hands, lift out the dressed salad and arrange on a serving plate.Gently knock the blunt end of each egg against a hard surface until it cracks, then peel. Cut the eggs into quarters and season lightly. Arrange these on top of the salad. Pit the olives, if you like, and rinse the salt off the capers and anchovies, if need be. Cut the anchovies into slivers. Scatter the olives, capers and anchovies all over the salad.Spoon the rest of the dressing on top of the salad, then strew the basil leaves on top just before serving. Eat with some good baguette to mop up all of those delicious juices. Note: the salad itself can be made a few hours in advance, and left to let the ingredients mingle, but don’t add the basil until the last minute.If you’d like to add tuna, as is often used in Provence, leave out the anchovies from the salad itself, if not the dressing (though you can eschew them altogether, if you prefer) – a small tin, drained and flaked over the top, is quite sufficient.

He came on in the 74th minute and, by the 79th minute, he had scored twice to make it 2-2 on aggregate. Spurs would squeak through with a late Christian Eriksen winner.At Birmingham there was the last‑day escape from relegation in 2016-17, when Adams scored the decisive goal at Bristol City and, last season, a return of 22 Championship goals, that led to his being named in the ision’s team of the season.But Adams’s story captures the imagination because of what he did before all of that how he slipped out of the academy system and was forced to find a springboard for his career in the non-leagues, which were every bit as bruising as the stereotype suggests.The big rejection came from Coventry City at 14 – he had been with them since the age of seven – but there were “four or five times” when he was turned down by Leicester City, his hometown club, after trials.“The first time would have been before Coventry, so under-8s, and it was until under-16s – that would have been my last go,” Adams says. “Leicester was the closest team to us so it was always a dream to play for them.“I can remember the day they released me at Coventry – it leaves a mark, definitely – although me and the family knew it was coming. You get a feel for when someone doesn’t want you, when you are kind of getting pushed away. It was just disappointment towards myself and the people that helped me get there.“But it either pushes you on or knocks you back. At that age, it’s make or break. You either go down the education route or you keep working hard at your football. That’s what I did. I didn’t really get on with the academy life and it was the right decision for me to go another way.”Adams’s salvation came at Ilkeston, the Derbyshire club that played in the seventh tier. He joined after a spell further down at Oadby, initially travelling from his home in Leicester, taking an early morning train to Derby followed by a long bus journey, before he moved into digs. Ilkeston trained full-time – a rarity at that level – and, for Adams, there was also a BTec level 3 college course in sports studies.“We’d train in the morning, get lunch – we’d have to walk to Tesco or something like that – and then it would be back in for education,” Adams says. “College was all right. The majority of the people were just there for the football, you could tell. I moved up to Ilkeston at 16, 17 and it was there that I first came to grips with the sacrifices you have to make to be at the top.”Adams remembers being paid “£75 a week or maybe £75 a game” after he broke into the Ilkeston first team and he certainly earned it. “It’s just a question of how hard you’re going to get kicked,” he says. “You definitely get kicked harder in non‑league because the referee is all the way in the other penalty box or on the other side of the pitch.“Of course it’s frustrating but I was a little boy and I couldn’t really say anything to the older men, could I? It’s a little kid running around you and you just want to kick him as hard as you can to stop him from doing that.”In the first few months of the 2014-15 season, Adams was the most in-demand player in non-league football. “Sixteen games, 11 goals, nine assists,” he says, showing the total recall of a striker for personal statistics. More than 40 clubs sent scouts to watch him on one occasion. “I was reading all sorts about myself,” Adams says. “It was overwhelming and special.” In November 2014 Nigel Clough paid £135,000 to take him to Sheffield United.Adams’s value has since soared – Birmingham have turned a tidy profit on the £2m that they stumped up to get him from Bramall Lane in 2016 – but what is striking is how there is nothing remotely big-time about him.He fears that he might have messed up in his unveiling interview with Southampton’s in-house media team, when he said that he now wanted to win the Premier League and, yes, it led to the inevitable mockery on social media. But Adams merely wanted to offer something wholehearted rather than bland. Do Southampton fans really want to hear their players say that they dream of finishing seventh?It would be wrong to mistake Adams’s ambition for cockiness. He is warm and easy company, and it is no surprise to hear that he has settled in seamlessly at Southampton he scored after 116 seconds of the team’s opening pre-season friendly against the Austrian team SCR Altach on Sunday. Adams’s non-league background has shaped and toughened him but the determination to make it as a footballer has burned since his childhood in Leicester’s Thurnby Lodge, which has the reputation of being a tough area.“No, I thought it was all right, to be honest. Everyone really knew each other, everyone knew what everyone did and so everyone’s got respect. It’s still like that now. I think everyone who comes up – they say they had a hard life but I think it’s just normal.”Adams’s role model was his mother, Frances, who raised him and his three older siblings. “She’d take me across the country to play football all the time, breaking down in the car on some days,” Adams says. “She made me the person I am today.”His focus on football also helped to ensure he did not get mixed up in the wrong things as he grew up. “I think everyone is going to get that pressure but it’s your mental strength,” he says. “Everyone had respect for me, they knew what I wanted to do, so I never really got caught up in it or they never involved me in anything like that. I’ve seen people make the wrong choices, I’ve seen it everywhere and it is scary but they made the choices.”To Adams, Southampton feels like the ideal fit. Ralph Hasenhüttl, the manager, is obsessed by speed and strength, high pressing and intelligence – and these are the qualities that define Adams’s game, together with an ability to unload shots quickly on the turn. Adams had other suitors, including Everton, West Ham and Burnley, and he could have got more money elsewhere. But he knows that Southampton can be a pathway for young players he believes in Hasenhüttl and his project.“Me and the gaffer had a chat, he told me the way he wanted to play and I thought it would suit me perfectly,” Adams says. “He wants to build something, achieve good things, and it’s something I wanted to be a part of. I know I caused a stir when I said about winning the league – probably too much of a stir – but it was just pure optimism, looking up rather than down. I want to get right to the top. It just depends on how hard you want to work how much you actually want it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24d4cfe41ef3b6ccf9709b3400714eac43371c3a/326_239_3458_2075/master/3458.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=658afd0dc94df289e79c9d082aeb1bca","title":"tottenham omit danny rose from asia tour to explore opportunities with other clubs","story":"• England defender expected to leave after omission• Vincent Janssen and Georges-Kévin Nkoudou also left outDanny Rose has been omitted from Tottenham’s party for their pre-season tour to Asia “to explore prospective opportunities with other clubs” as Mauricio Pochettino’s restructuring of his squad continues.The England full back now looks set to follow fellow defender Kieran Trippier in leaving Spurs just six weeks after the pair started in the Champions League final defeat to Liverpool in Madrid, with Rose left behind along with Vincent Janssen and Georges-Kévin Nkoudou for the tour of Singapore and Shanghai.

So what drives a generation of young men to the all-consuming, often dangerous pursuit of perfection?It is difficult for Miles to pinpoint the moment his muscle dysmorphia started. It was just always there, a background hum. “As far back as I can remember, I wanted a better-looking body,” says the 35-year-old US soldier, now stationed in Mons, Belgium. When he was 13, Miles spent a summer cutting grass to save up for a secondhand Soloflex exercise machine. The machine cost $1,000 (£800), but as Miles was too young to join a gym, it was worth the expense. With the help of the Soloflex, Miles started weight training and never looked back.When he returned from a posting to Afghanistan at 24, things spiralled. He began obsessively working out and regimenting his meals. “I went all in ... it was full, hardcore dedication to the lifestyle.” Miles set his watch to beep every three hours, to remind him to eat. If it beeped when he was driving, he would pull over. Slowly, he whittled his body into shape. His muscles became striated, every fibre visible. Not big enough. At 95kg (210lbs) and 1.8 metres (6ft 2in), Miles wanted to be more muscular leaner. He lost 22kg and started competing in amateur bodybuilding competitions. There was virtually no fat on him. “You pinch your skin and it just stays pinched.” His girlfriend left him. “She began to realise that my body dysmorphia was like dating another person.” The pursuit of muscularity took over his life. “I just thought, I am so lean, and shredded, and veiny, and masculine – I don’t ever want to go back to how I was before.”Yet by 33, single again – the dysmorphia had claimed yet another relationship – it had all become too much and he was in a dark place. “I did not enjoy life in any way, shape or form.” All day long, he would starve himself, struggle through punishing workouts, go home and binge-eat before throwing it all up. One evening, waiting in line at the burger chain In-N-Out for more food to purge, Miles finally decided enough was enough. “I woke up so happy the next day, knowing it was over.”What drives a generation of young men to slavishly pursue this physical ideal? “Over the past decades, the idealised male body image has got bigger and bulkier,” says Nagata.This body type even pressed its way into our children’s bedrooms: studies show that action figures have become brawnier over the past 25 years.This wasn’t always the case. “In the 70s, we saw very slim, almost androgynous men, like Mick Jagger and David Bowie ... to be muscular was to be defined as to be militaristic, at a time when, in the US, there were protests against the Vietnam war,” says Dr Roberto Olivardia of Harvard Medical School, an expert in male body image. “So that build was really frowned on and rejected by youth culture.“But then the 80s came about, with figures like Ronald Reagan, who was pro-military, and men like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone.” This ideal male – hyper-masculine, militaristic, strong above all else – was exported globally through films such as First Blood (1982), Predator (1987) and The Terminator (1984). WWE wrestling was founded in 1980, and the likes of Hulk Hogan became celebrities. In the late 90s, a leaner but still very muscular aesthetic – popularised by Brad Pitt in the movie Fight Club – became fashionable.Today’s muscle men stare down at us from the billboards of superhero films featuring stars such as Chris Hemsworth or Jason Momoa, the latter only last week body-shamed online after photographs emerged of him enjoying himself on holiday in fractionally less-than-superhero condition. On the small screen, the current crop of Love Island contestants mug for the cameras in tiny swimming trunks, all the better to display their perfect six-packs.However, just as fashion magazines don’t cause anorexia, but contribute to a toxic environment in which extreme thinness is celebrated, Hulk Hogan, Dwayne ‘the Rock’ Johnson and Chris Hemsworth are not to be blamed for the disordered behaviours sweeping our gyms. According to the NHS, we do not yet know what causes body dysmorphia disorders but genetics, a chemical imbalance in the brain or a traumatic experience in your past may play a part. You are also more likely to develop it if you were bullied or abused as a child, something student Nathaniel Shaw knows well. The 28-year-old was bullied at secondary school – they called him a Borrower, on account of his slender frame.“I was always the small kid in the corner that no one wanted to speak to.” Social acceptance came one squat press at a time. “From where I’m from in Nottingham, because it’s a very rough place, you’re training to protect yourself. The bigger guys are the serious people that no one wants to mess with. That was the main thing at the start – get big and be taken seriously.”When Shaw went to college at age 17, he had a plan: work out all winter and reveal his buff body come summer. But when he took off his T-shirt playing football one afternoon, a girl said that Shaw “had no chest”. He instantly put his top back on. “I still wasn’t good enough.” The unkind comment laid waste to Shaw’s fragile self-esteem he walked away from the wreckage determined to become even more shredded.Shaw’s life became: the gym, home to eat enormous portions of tuna, pasta and cheese, move as little as possible to conserve energy and repeat. Shaw detached from the contours of normal life. He stayed in bed longer, later and missed exams. He was depressed. “The pursuit of this muscular ideal takes over people’s lives,” explains Nagata. “They become obsessed with it. They can’t function in their daily life outside of pursuing this ideal and it can lead to depression, missing school or work, and losing their ability to do basic living tasks.”To an observer, Shaw – who weighed 80kg at 1.7 metres – was tank-like. But that wasn’t how he saw himself. “I would be in the gym and say: ‘I look like shit.’ Everyone would be like: ‘No you don’t, you’re huge, I wish I could look like that.’” Muscle dysmorphia is a disease of perception. Although its sufferers live in the material world – a place of grunting exertion and weighted bags and scoopable protein powders – they spend most of their time in an imagined reality, where they are incalculably huge. Their biceps are swollen watermelons each muscle as finely striated as the delicate contours of a seashell.But even if they eventually achieve that physique, it is not enough. As soon as one muscular ideal is achieved, a new goal appears. “There’s a saying: ‘Once you step into a gym, you’re forever small,’” says 27-year-old Rich Selby, an amateur bodybuilder from Cardiff. Miles agrees. “Every muscle could be bigger. I could be leaner. You look at yourself and feel like everything is small and weak. I have no chest muscles I have no arm muscles ... you’re judging yourself against an impossible standard.”Social media reflects this standard back at you. “You’re being sold a false reality,” says Miles. “I can get into really good shape, right before I’m doing a bodybuilding competition, and use lighting and angles and filters to make my physique look even crazier than it already is, and save a bunch of pictures and upload them to make it seem that I always look like that, all year round.”Some turn to illegal substances to attain this ideal. Tony, 23, works for a pharmaceutical distributor in Dallas. He started taking illegal performance-enhancing drugs, including testosterone, equipoise and nandrolone, two years ago. The drugs created a dangerous feedback loop: the more he injected, the more his body changed and the more he took. “People are like: ‘Wow, that guy’s a tank.’ They have more respect for you ... I thought, heck yeah, I’m going to take more so I can get even bigger.”It is a common experience: muscle dysmorphia can be fuelled by the positive reinforcement men receive from other men in the gym. “When you’re large, you get a lot of respect,” Selby confirms. Men come up to him and ask how much he can bench. Sometimes they try to start fights. “That’s why people become addicted. They’re insecure, so they need confirmation from other people.” Selby self-identifies as having muscle dysmorphia, but believes that he has it under control, because he has good self-esteem.Up close, you can see the havoc muscle dysmorphia wreaks. “Your interpersonal relationships fall apart – but you are so caught up in the endorphin rush of affirmation from your gym buddies, you barely notice,” says Miles. “You’re kind of an asshole. You don’t realise it ... you just become this all-around grouch. It consumes not only all of your time and focus, but also the human part of you.” It’s also a lonely existence. All your time is spent preparing protein-rich food, but because you are over-exercising, you are often “hungry, and cranky, and don’t sleep well”.Tony was one young man who used drugs to bulk up. He knew what he was doing was dangerous: he would even donate blood to get his blood pressure down. “I just genuinely didn’t care.” As he cycled on and off drugs, he experienced dramatic mood swings. He got fired from his job at a hardware store for screaming at a coworker in the break room. Eventually, his mental health deteriorated so much that he came off all the drugs in May last year.What makes someone play Russian roulette with a steroid-filled syringe? Selby thinks people are driven to desperate measures because they cannot disassociate who they are from how they look.It’s an obsession that can prove fatal. Freddie Dibben, 28, died in March 2017 after his heart became enlarged by the stimulant Clenbuterol. His father Clifford, 69, found him. “The hardest part was going back through to the kitchen and telling his mum what I found. It’ll never go away.” Like Tony, Freddie experienced mood swings. “He would snap at you,” Clifford says, recalling an incident where Freddie was “stroppy” with him as they tinkered with his car. He put the moodiness down to work stress – Freddie had been pulling a lot of night shifts at Wilton carpet factory, where colleagues referred to him as a “forklift”, on account of how much he could carry.But Clifford felt blessed to have a health-conscious son he didn’t see anything to be alarmed about. A keen gym-goer, Freddie even gave up smoking at his parents’ request. “He used to cook all his own food! He’d cook a meal before he went to work ... he had two sets of scales, and he weighed all his vegetables, everything. He even kept notes of what he was eating and what he was doing.” Clifford laughs, bitterly. “Except for the bloody drugs.”And that is one of the issues of muscle dysmorphia – you can hide in plain sight. A pair of weighing scales in the kitchen tupperware boxes of chicken and broccoli in your backpack. Most people view these as harmless, if idiosyncratic, behaviours. And when you look like you are hewn out of marble, it is hard to consider anything is amiss. It is only when you step past the facade that you realise these statue-like men are slowly destroying themselves.•Some of the names in the piece have been changedComments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

He’s not wrong. A full orchestra take their seats and welcome on stage Mr Malibu himself, Burt Bacharach, frail of foot but still dextrous at the piano and with some of popular music’s most ubiquitous tunes falling from the folds of his slacks.The aesthetic is extravagant supper club, with an underlying agenda. Having rested for decades on the laurels of his staggering 60s and 70s songbook, at 91 Bacharach is undergoing a late-career resurgence driven by emotional altruism. He wrote a score for the 2016 film A Boy Called Po, the true story of an autistic child, in tribute to his daughter Nikki who killed herself after suffering with undiagnosed Asperger’s syndrome.America’s descent into violence and despotism, meanwhile, has jolted easy listening’s Mr Nice into revolt. He introduces 2018’s Live to See Another Day, his response to the near-weekly school shootings in the US, with a desolate “nothing will change”, and his anti-Trump track With a Voice “would be more biting, edgy and angry” if he’d written it another 18 months into the presidency. These songs are too syrupy and suppliant to spark riots, but the fact that the man who wrote Walk On By felt obliged to pen them speaks volumes to America’s identity crisis. What the World Needs Now Is Love never sounded so pertinent.The vibe is plush and luxuriant enough, though, that it’s easy to bypass the politics and wallow in the ultimate lounge masterclass. Bacharach’s songs are at the mercy of the singer: when John Pagano steps from the trio of backing vocalists to handle the 1998 Elvis Costello collaboration This House Is Empty Now his cabaret delivery strips it of Costello’s barbs and renders it more Richard Marx-on-Broadway, but when Joss Stone slinks from the wings, barefoot in red, she wraps herself around the classics with a compassion and conviction that make her a Bacharach foil every bit the equal of Dusty or Dionne.In her hands, Burt’s finest compositions sweep by with the un-showy simplicity of songs fully aware of their own brilliance: Wishin’ \u0026amp Hopin’, I Say a Little Prayer, the melted military march of I Don’t Know What to Do With Myself and an utterly sublime I’ll Never Fall in Love Again. Their coy, giggly banter curls toes, and Burt almost blows his nice guy front when he admits he wrote Brazilian samba groove The Look of Love for Ursula Andress rather than then-wife Angie Dickinson, but their musical chemistry is palpable.Just as delicate and powerful is Josie James’s rendition of Anyone Who Had a Heart, lacking Cilla’s wallop but reined in to such perfection that its explosive climax gets the evening’s first ovation. But Burt himself steals the show with his fragile Alfie and by beaming his way through a singalong of Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My Head: magic moments of pure affection for this master of the softest arts.

After being advised to do so by the prime minister, the Queen formally prorogues Parliament. This takes the form of an announcement in the House of Lords on the Queen\u0027s behalf. It is a speech, written by the government, which usually describes the bills which have been passed during that session, and summarises what has been achieved.It means that all work on existing legislation stops, and MPs and Lords stop sitting. Prorogation also automatically kills any bills, early day motions or questions to ministers going through parliament.\u0026nbspParliament can then be reopened a few days later with a fresh slate of legislation intentions, set out in a new Queen\u0027s Speech at the formal State Opening of Parliament.Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary and a supporter of Johnson, told a Commons committee on Wednesday that no-deal Brexit was “underpriced” and he believes preparations needed to be ramped up.Following reports that he clashed last week with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, by telling him the EU withdrawal agreement was dead, Barclay said this was “not a controversial observation”.“In terms of the withdrawal agreement, what I said was that the House had rejected it three times, including the third time by a significant margin that the European election results in my view had further hardened attitudes across the house and that the text, unchanged, I did not envisage going through the house,” he said.He said: “A no-deal Brexit would be disruptive,” but added: “No Brexit is the worst of those two outcomes.”Barclay also revealed that the government was looking at compensating sheep farmers in the event of a no-deal Brexit, following warnings from the National Farmers’ Union that this would result in shepherds being forced to slaughter their flocks because there would be no market for their meat.Barclay set out his view that parliament would be asked to vote on any new deal achieved by the next prime minister, and then if that was rejected, it would be offered a choice of revoking Brexit or leaving with no deal.“But the question then will be is there a deal that is palatable to parliament and if not will parliament vote to revoke or will we leave with no deal?”However, any prime minister going down that path could face a no-confidence motion first. Tory backbenchers fighting a hard Brexit, including Hammond, Dominic Grieve, Justine Greening and Guto Bebb, would have to weigh up whether to vote to bring down their own government and risk a general election rather than allow the UK to depart on no-deal terms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26f400b3f7b1eb2c0cefb0e3c55a0ca69c4009d3/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7800d19e26ca9200f165290860546fc","title":"storm area 51 internet meme facebook event","story":"Please don’t attempt to raid Nevada to ‘see them aliens’ as part of the internet’s joke du jour, the US air force will not be amusedUrban legend has it that Area 51 is a weird place. Yet even if the conspiracy theories are true and the Nevada air force facility harbors extraterrestrial technology andor life, it would still barely qualify as being weirder than the internet where, early this month the anonymous users behind a Facebook meme page proposed a jaunty group invasion of the restricted compound.In a Facebook event titled “Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us,” the creators explain: “We will all meet up at the Area 51 Alien Center tourist attraction and coordinate our entry. If we naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets. Let’s see them aliens.”The “naruto run” part of this call to action refers to the particular, oft-memed, ostrich-like sprint of a popular Japanese anime character.Their plan, scheduled for the wee hours of 20 September, has gained momentum 1.4 million people have RSVP’d as “attending” the raid, while 1.1 million more are “interested”.In a post pinned to the top of the event page, a user named Jackson Barnes has drawn a diagram “game plan”, illustrating how different factions of attendees could best swarm the base.Beneath his scheme, Barnes writes: “Hello US government, this is a joke, and I do not actually intend to go ahead with this plan. I just thought it would be funny and get me some thumbsy uppies on the internet.” (He currently has 101,000 “thumbsy uppies” for his effort).Barnes’s disclaimer contains perhaps the most important bit of information to retain from this story: “Storm Area 51” is all a joke. And through engaging with that joke, most people are simply trying to take it to further extremes of silliness, such as by posting goofy blitzkrieg suggestions based on astrological signs.The US air force, however, is not amused, with a spokeswoman telling the New York Times “any attempt to illegally access military installations or military training areas is dangerous”. “No trespassing” signs in the area reportedly state that the use of “deadly force” against intruders is authorized.The Times also noted that Nevada’s alien-themed Little A’Le’Inn hotel has been booked solid on 20 September, with many guests referencing the Facebook event while making reservations. It seems some people hope to take this gag as far as they can.Granted, even those who do travel to Nevada with the intent to descend upon Area 51 are very unlikely to get anywhere close to the base’s restricted zone, not only because it’s assiduously surveilled and patrolled, but because it’s located deep within a desolate and punishingly hot stretch of desert, far from amenities like convenience stores and public bathrooms. Is that really how anyone wants to spend their vacation days? In this economy?Whether this wildfire meme will be forgotten by next week, or catalyze real (inadvisable!) action come 20 September remains to be seen.The truth, maybe, is out there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b54fd0332a522661c712c05d0730be3bc0610560/14_0_3293_1976/master/3293.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba35e6bc9b1f276c57bfa3f8c861881c","title":"montana fossilized dueling dinosaurs skeletons dino cowboy","story":"A Montana rancher found two skeletons in combat – the Dueling Dinosaurs. But who do they belong to, and will the public ever see them? The early June morning in Montana was already very hot and dry by 7.30, when Clayton Phipps and his friend, Mark Eatman, set out to search for fossils. Phipps, a rancher who calls himself the Dino Cowboy, was wearing his trademark black felt Stetson cattleman hat.The two had gone bone collecting before, but they were joined on this day for the first time by Phipps’s cousin, Chad O’Connor. The trio fanned out to hike through the badlands of what they thought was the Judith River Formation later, they would learn they had actually been in an area called Hell Creek, a ision of gray and ochre sandstone, shale and clay deposited about 66m years ago during the Late Cretaceous, when the area was a swampy floodplain.Phipps, like most locals, calls it the Hell Crik. It’s one of the most storied dinosaur fossil sites in the world.At lunchtime, the group reconvened for roast beef sandwiches. Phipps asked Eatman if he had found anything. Yes, he said⁠, a pelvis weathering out of a hill – not a big deal, except this one appeared to have an articulated femur, potentially suggesting a rare level of completeness. They went to the site. Phipps could tell right away it was from a ceratopsian, a group of herbivorous, beaked dinosaurs. He brushed away some of the sand, and thought there might be more of the dinosaur buried in the hillside.But excavating it would have to wait for another day: he had 260 acres of hay to cut for cattle feed.Eatman went back to Billings, where he had gotten a job at a carpet store after a run of bad luck put an end to his 13-year career as a full-time fossil hunter. (“His wife said: ‘We’re starving to death – you gotta get a real job,’” Phipps recalls.)O’Connor and Phipps headed home to Phipps’s ranch. “We weren’t all that excited,” he says. “It was a pelvis in the ground at the bottom of a canyon that was really remote and no roads to it at all. We had no plans to go back, but Chad convinced us to. I’m sure glad we did.”Phipps and O’Connor returned to the site about a month later, this time with Lige and Mary Ann Murray, ranchers who owned the land where the bones had been found. In the US, fossils found on private land belong to the landowner prospectors simply need their permission to dig. The Murrays signed off, and Phipps and O’Connor got to work. They built a road to the site. They began excavating the ceratopsian with penknives and brushes. Business partners were brought in secret contracts were arranged. Eatman came to help when he could, along with a rotating cast of confidants.After two weeks, the body of the plant-eater had been revealed. It was more than a pelvis and femur – it looked like a fairly complete skeleton of Triceratops horridus, which is the triceratops you’re thinking of. One day, Phipps was behind the wheel of his uncle’s backhoe, scooping out soil from around the fossil so it could be removed. Carefully watching each dump of the bucket, at one point he noticed dark fragments among the light-colored sandstone.Oh no, he thought. He jumped down, combed through the sand, found the claw of a theropod. Theropods, like Tyrannosaurus rex, are three-toed carnivores. That doesn’t match the plant-eater, Phipps thought. What is happening here?Phipps scrambled down into the quarry where he had been digging and brushed away more sand. A hand appeared. Then a leg. It was clear: there was another dinosaur in the outcrop.“It was just surreal,” Phelps remembers. “Obviously, these two dinosaurs weren’t friends, so what were they doing in there together?”Phipps had been hunting for dinosaur fossils since 1998, excavating and preparing them to sell at trade shows and to museums and private collectors. But he had never found anything like this. “I think,” he says, “my hat went in the air that day.”This was in 2006. Three months of intensive excavation followed, during which Phipps lost 15 pounds. In the end, he and his partners had a 28ft-long ceratopsian and a 22ft-long theropod in four multi-ton blocks. “A little cowboy ingenuity, and we got ’em out of the hills,” Phipps says.The meat-eater was either a juvenile T rex or its relative, Nanotyrannus lancensis, a rare dwarf species whose existence is disputed. Both dinosaurs were extraordinarily well-preserved, fully articulated, with envelopes of skin and, possibly, mummified internal organs.Best of all, they seemed to have died together, not washed into their grave separately. And they appeared to have been battling when they died: teeth were found in the spine and near the pelvis of the ceratopsian, and the theropod’s skull was split laterally, as if it had been kicked.Phipps dubbed them the Montana Dueling Dinosaurs. “They’re remarkable specimens,” says Mark Norell, chairman of paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History. “Especially the tyrannosaur – it could go a long way toward resolving whether nanotyrannus was its own species.”Thirteen years later, the number of people who have seen the fossils remains in the low double digits. They’ve still not been fully extracted from the rock matrix, cleaned, prepped, studied or put on display. Phipps isn’t even at liberty to say where they are – he’ll only reveal that they’re at an American museum, pending the resolution of Murray v BEJ Minerals LLC, which deals with who owns what’s on top of the land versus what’s beneath it.“Dinosaurs bring drama,” Phipps says, “and being a cowboy, I’m not a drama fan. You can have it.”For years after unearthing the Dueling Dinosaurs, Phipps and his team tried every tactic they could think of to drum up interest for a sale. They set up a website, and a marketing campaign called the Paleo-Incident Project. They tried to get sponsors, like Dr Pepper, to fund further work on the fossils. They posted videos on YouTube, men in western wear standing around the fossil jackets, taking turns talking into microphones.They contacted natural history museums around the world, including the Smithsonian – where the bones were offered for a reported $15m – and the Museum of the Rockies, in Billings, whose head paleontologist, Jack Horner (the inspiration for the character played by Sam Neill in Jurassic Park) told them they were scientifically useless.“In order for a specimen to be of scientific use and publishable, we have to know its exact geographic position, its exact stratigraphic position, and the specimen must also be in the public trust, accessible for study, which this specimen is not,” Horner says.Phipps called Horner’s reaction “sad”, adding: “If somebody in his position is telling the world that the best dinosaurs possibly ever discovered in the world are worthless, what donor’s gonna donate anything to paleontology?”Acrimony between commercial and academic paleontologists is abundant. “The haters are always gonna hate,” Phipps says. “No question about that.”In the meantime, other valuable dinosaur fossils were found on the 27,000-acre Murray ranch, including a well-preserved triceratops skull and nearly complete adult T rex, which a Dutch museum purchased for several million dollars. The Dueling Dinosaurs themselves went to auction in 2013 at Bonhams in New York, but no bid met the reserve price of $6m.Though the fossils technically belonged to the Murrays, they ceded control of what to do with them to Phipps and his team via a contract, the details of which remain private. “We have a pretty loose arrangement, to be real truthful,” Mary Ann says. The deal specifies that any proceeds be split between the Murrays and Phipps Phipps will then subide his percentage with his team, which includes the owners of CK Preparations, a commercial fossil services company, and Peter Larson of the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, which has unearthed some of the most complete T rex specimens ever found.Larson’s story is also one of loss. After the T rex known as “Sue” was discovered by Black Hills in 1990, a dispute arose over its legal ownership. Two years later, the bones were seized by the FBI and South Dakota national guard in a highly publicized case, and ownership was returned to the landowner, a Sioux rancher whose deed was held in trust by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He sold Sue at auction for a record $8.36m to the Field Museum in Chicago. Subsequently, Larson was sentenced to two years in federal prison on separate charges related to trafficking fossils, including failing to report to customs traveler’s checks and cash transported internationally, and illegally taking a fossil worth less than $100 from federal land.His experience with the legal morass around dinosaur fossils would prove useful later.Lige and Mary Ann Murray were young hired hands in 1983 when they began working for George Severson, a longtime Montana rancher. The Murrays had a good relationship with him and a few years later, near the end of his life, Severson sold them half of his ranch, leaving the rest to his sons, Jerry and Bo, who live outside the state.For 14 years, the Seversons and Murrays operated the ranch in amicable partnership. But in 2005, the Murrays purchased the other half of the land. Exactly why is unclear the Seversons say Lige called to ask about buying them out, while Mary Ann says the Seversons approached them unexpectedly. An agreement was reached to split the estate: the Murrays would control all of the surface rights and one-third of the mineral rights, and the Seversons would retain the rest of the mineral rights.The following summer, the Dueling Dinosaurs were found.“Lige and I knew nothing about fossils,” Mary Ann Murray says. “We just ran cows and farms, that’s all we did.”Fossils, undoubtedly, can be composed of minerals, but they have generally been recognized as belonging to the surface estate owner – whom we normally think of as the landowner – in cases where the estate is split. The Department of the Interior ruled in 1915 that “fossil remains of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals are not mineral”, after the Carnegie Museum of Natural History paleontologist Earl Douglass had tried to procure a huge deposit of dinosaur bones with a mining claim. (The site today is Dinosaur National Monument.) This imposed some semblance of order after the wild west days of fossil hunting, when rivalrous collectors like Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh would freely roam public lands, digging up fossils to sell to museums or wealthy collectors. It has been the precedent ever since.The Seversons say they didn’t know the bones were worth much until 2013, when they were appraised between $7 and $9m before the auction. So they decided to assert a mineral rights claim after the Murrays refused to share any of the future proceeds. The following year, the Murrays filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that the fossils were theirs because they owned the surface estate. A district court ruled in their favor, leading the Seversons to appeal to the US ninth circuit.In a test, last November that court ruled that fossils on Montana state and private land could be considered minerals. “Once upon a time, in a place now known as Montana, dinosaurs roamed the land,” begins Judge Eduardo Robreno’s opinion. “On a fateful day, some 66m years ago, two such creatures, a 22ft-long theropod and a 28ft-long ceratopsian, engaged in mortal combat. While history has not recorded the circumstances surrounding this encounter, the remnants of these Cretaceous species, interlocked in combat, became entombed under a pile of sandstone. That was then … this is now.”The decision sent shockwaves through the field of paleontology, jeopardizing as it did the status of any fossil found on private land in Montana. The Murrays filed for an en banc appeal, supported by an amicus curiae brief from paleontological institutions including the Field Museum, the Museum of the Rockies and the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology – which had opposed Larson in the Sue case.“By reversing a widely accepted understanding of land rights,” the brief states, “the panel decision subjects scientifically important fossil collections to damaging ownership disputes and impedes future efforts of the paleontological community to discover, collect and study fossils.”The state of Montana, meanwhile, unanimously passed legislation clarifying the definition of fossils and distinguishing them from minerals.En banc appeals are rarely granted, but in May the Murrays got good news: the ninth circuit, “in the spirit of comity and federalism”, vacated its decision and punted the case to the Montana supreme court, where it will be taken up later this year.Larson sees some similarities to the Sue case – “when people, through a lot of hard work, make a fantastic discovery, there’s always somebody with their hand open” – but he’s more optimistic about the outcome for the Dueling Dinosaurs. And while the Seversons, the Murrays and the commercial paleontologists disagree on much, they all claim to want the fossils to end up in a museum, where their immense scientific potential can be explored, and they can be put on display for people – the undisputed inheritors of natural history.The question of who owns a fossil gets slippier the further back one goes. Before the Murrays or Seversons ever set foot in Montana, it was Sioux, Cheyenne, Crow and Blackfoot territory. The oldest dated human burial site in North America is near present-day Wilsall, Montana. For millions of years before that, the uplift of the Laramide orogeny, which created the Rocky Mountains in the west, was depositing thousands of feet of sediment in what is now eastern Montana, creating the rare conditions needed to fossilize the remains of the terrible lizards that had roamed that land long before, for humans to later find and fight over.But that was then. This is now.“To get it down in cowboy terms, I’m getting an education in our justice system I never wanted to pay for,” Phipps says. “I’m in my 40s and I’d never needed an attorney until this. I try to live my life to avoid ’em.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec7b07a7575c33e2bc28cd1fb6d913695c4ad44/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5c8ae63d3b252ce40203edec4d1474b","title":"cricket world cup 10 fans countries review action","story":"Readers from around the world reflect on seven weeks of cricket and one astounding finalEngland’s run to the semi-finals, and indeed final, could not have been more quintessentially English. The team came into the tournament on a great run and hope was lifted to even greater heights with a few high-quality performances, only to be met with a crash back to traditional English cynicism when we almost inevitably lost to two tournament underdogs. From this point on though, they were exceptional, rising to the challenge of what essentially became four consecutive knockout games.What else can be said about the final? It was the best game of cricket I’ve witnessed and quite possibly the best of all time. The match had it all and England finally proved that they can stand up in those pressure moments in a knockout tournament. They had no small degree of luck and there was plenty of tension, but how else would you want to win your first Cricket World Cup?Let’s hope this group stays together for one more World Cup under the cool head of Eoin Morgan and a coach who will further develop this exciting brand of cricket. It would be easy to see this as the pinnacle, but how incredible would it be to push for an Australia-esque World Cup dynasty? Matt LeechWe delivered the greatest of World Cup finals. No other countries would have produced such a game. New Zealand always get stuck into games and regularly deliver some of the greatest cricketing spectacles. It’s such a shame we remain financially uninteresting for cricketing schedulers. Winning the World Cup might have changed that, but we are worthy runners-up.Jimmy Neesham was my player of the tournament. He plays hard and fearless, keeps going and has a mental toughness and mature outlook on life. He will have plenty of big moments in his career. Malcolm EddingtonIndia were like a critically acclaimed television show. After power-packed leading performances from neo-noir legend Rohit Sharma and the experimental yet highly engaging directorship from Jasprit Bumrah, most expected that pair, along with a strong supporting cast, to help India execute a stunning finale. But, despite bringing in the biggest viewing figures, the show was cancelled at the last moment by the executives at the World Cup – the notorious Kiwis.MS Dhoni was a fan favourite, but his personal style did not suit the overall tone of the crew. Rishabh Pant, a cult hero on the local soap opera, Indian Premier League, wasn’t ready for the biggest stage just yet. Surely, by the time the next big show comes around, he will be in the spotlight. Scriptwriter Virat Kohli was excellent but still did not meet his lofty standards and fluffed the ending. Cameos from Sir Ravindra Jadeja grabbed bits and pieces of the public imagination and an unexpected starring role during India’s final moments justified calls for his regular introduction to the set-up in the future. Abhijato SensarmaDespite the horrible thrashing in the semi-final, we performed above expectations. Six months ago I didn’t think we’d make it to the last four in some respects we got through because other sides failed to deliver.Mitchell Starc was our best performer. It was a shame he went AWOL in the last two matches. Alex Carey looked a class above most in his ball-striking and attitude. He was a real find. To play a great knock after being cleaned up by Jofra Archer really showed he has what it takes. The performances of Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis were really disappointing. The one innings where Maxwell looked really like to kick into gear was the one where Usman Khawaja ran him out horribly.The semi-final revealed all our weaknesses at once, which was a shame. Unfortunately our domestic one-day competition is now contained in a short period at the start of our season. It’s not enough for players to improve their skills in this format on the biggest international stage. Scott MeehanPakistan did well. Our performance would be viewed much more positively had we reached the semi-finals, but that’s how fine the margins are. The game against West Indies was very costly and some fans think the Sri Lanka washout was a missed opportunity. Although we have no one to blame but ourselves for not reaching the last four.After beating both the finalists in the group stage, it’s a shame we weren’t consistent enough elsewhere. We have a few special players coming through and they will surely help. Although fielding remains a problem. Awais AhmedWe were hot favourites to finish in the bottom two, yet finished sixth and may have qualified for the semis had we won our two washed-out matches. We have a bright talent in Avishka Fernando. In fact, we could have a fearsome batting unit in 2023. The bowling will be the real concern. We have to search hard for the next Malingas and Muralis. Malinga still has a role to play in four years’ time. We need his personality and experience in the team. And our former cricketers need to take part in building cricket from scratch. The current administration is useless. Akesh SamudithaIt took us four games to get a point on the board and we had to thank the English summer weather for that. South Africa paid the price for a terribly slow start, and highlights were few and far between. The AB De Villiers debate before the tournament obviously didn’t help.I’m hugely disappointed that we were so poor early on. The late wins against Sri Lanka and and Australia, were spoiled by the fact that there was so very little to play for. Wasting a successful 300+ run chase against Australia in a dead rubber hurts. Nils LouwAfter a great start to the tournament – beating South Africa and almost forcing a win against the Kiwis – the Tigers threatened to be the story of the World Cup, but it never quite happened. Instead the campaign ended in a whimper with damaging losses against both south Asian neighbours. The defeat to Pakistan was particularly disappointing given the historical context and the fact they were playing in front of a packed house at Lord’s. It was easily their worst performance of the tournament.In contrast, the stunning run chase against the Windies on the postage stamp-sized Taunton ground was the tournament highlight, reaching the target of 322 with such ease and with so many overs to spare. It gave fans genuine hope for a top-four finish. Had fine margins gone their way, a semi-final place would have been a reality.The team didn’t quite live up to its billing for the emotional Tiger fans. A feeling of the wheels coming off was compounded by the swift dismissal of coach Steve Rhodes long before England lifted the trophy.Giving player of the tournament to Kane Williamson was obviously a sympathy vote. Shakib Al Hasan was the true star of the World Cup. After spending a decade being the most underrated international cricketer in the most underrated international team, Shakib finally became a household name – for those households with Sky TV anyway. His consistency batting at No 3, often arriving at the crease early in the innings, and scoring at nearly a run a ball was staggering. Add to that tidy reliable off-spin and you have the complete package. Tawhid QureshiWe were terrible for most of it. Bowling Pakistan out for 105 in the first game got our hopes up, but there wasn’t enough thought into anything after that and we played out the tournament as a Chris Gayle testimonial tour. At least we beat a plucky Afghanistan side.The authorities must begin planning for the next World Cup immediately by investing in players who will be available solely for the longer version of the game. We have become champions of the T20 game, but the same players struggle in longer formats. T20 is hurting the quality of players in the longer versions. The problem remains that we have a very small pool of players. Glen DucreayIt was always going to be tough. Always. I’m disappointed we didn’t take any points but there were some competitive performances. Falling 11 runs short of beating India, and two balls from shocking Pakistan, were the best memories.Captain Mohammad Nabi had plenty to say before the tournament, but his inexperience showed in the field. I’ll be happy if we can progress tactically and learn from the experience of playing against the very best.

The 18-year-old said she would cherish the memory but was sad not to keep the ball as a memento.“I’d love to have the ball but I have no idea where it’s gone,” Kyung said. “I’d be grateful if someone found it for me.”Footballers get to keep the match ball when they score a hat-trick and baseball players often keep the ball they hit for their first career run or homer – if they can trade a signed bat or other memorabilia to get it back.Kyung went home without her ball but was nevertheless feted after her goal provided a little respite with the Koreans losing 27-0. “When I took the shot I didn’t think it was going to go in,” said Kyung. “But I gave it everything I had. I couldn’t have done it without my teammates.”South Korea only managed to rustle up a team a month before the start of the competition, calling on former swimmers, with all but captain Oh Hee-ji still in their teens.Their dogged determination evoked memories of Equatorial Guinean swimmer Eric “The Eel” Moussambani, who clung to the lane rope at the 2000 Sydney Olympics in his first dip in a 50-metre pool before making it to the wall as the crowd erupted.“Our coaches told us that we’re here to show people that we’re ready to battle hard,” Kyung said. “They also said we grew so much after the first game – we shed many tears of joy.”The local crowd got into the spirit as fans danced along to Korean pop classic Gangnam Style blaring from the venue’s loudspeakers, including a group of elderly women, who brought the house down by copying musician Psy’s raunchy moves.Back on the pool deck, Korean-American Ryan Hanna Yoon promised there was more to come from the hosts.“It was really emotional because we’ve been going through a lot,” she said. “The goal means everything for us. We’re just beginners in water polo.”Asked about her hopes for their next game against Canada on Thursday, Yoon smiled: “Scoring more and having them score less.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45ca6fd946769afb2a481fc6646b0ecb81615eb/0_256_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=165c1a154f45b2bb03b3c8a17efaa412","title":"tour de france 2019 stage 11 live","story":"Highlight of the day so far is the glorious scenery of the Tarn region – absolutely stunning. One kilometre to the summit of this climb.The gap is still stable just under 2min 30sec as the leaders close in on the foot of the category three Cote de Tonnac.Local interest today: Calmejane was born in Albi, while Perez lives in Toulouse. The peloton have held the gap at just over two minutes so the sprinters’ teams clearly want to keep them within a manageable range. That has to be pretty dispiriting with 160km to ride.The breakaway lead stretches to over two minutes. The quartet are all over an hour down on GC so can be given plenty of space. Calmejane is either horribly out of form or has been deliberately keeping his powder dry in an attempt to gain admittance to a break. He’s got decent TDF pedigree, winning a stage in 2017 and finishing 35th and 30th in the past two years.The riders exit the neutralised early kilometres and immediately a four-man break scampers up the road. Anthony Perez of Cofidis, Stéphane Rossetto also of Cofidis, Total Direct Energie’s Lilian Calmejane and Aimé De Gendt of Wanty. Three French riders and a Belgian.“Thanks John, for sharing the EF racing film and for the tour coverage,” writes Robert Betts. “On a similar theme are the films made by the Morton brothers (Lachlan and Gus) as they go on various cycle touring adventures. The brothers are good company as they ponder life outside the sport and cycling for the love of it: Thereabouts. There are three ‘Thereabouts’ films each around an hour in length.”Thanks for that Robert. I have to say, I get very jealous of how good these videos look. Whenever I go out on a ride, the only photos I generally take (because I’m a mature inidual) are of ‘hilarious’ street names. Yesterday, for example:Off we go then. The riders roll slowly out of Albi (which looks rather lovely) in glorious sunshine. There’s the chance of a bit of wind later in the stage and therefore potential for nervousness in the peloton as we get close to Toulouse.The last time the Tour finished in Toulouse was 2008. That day – in the rain – Mark Cavendish sprinted to his second stage victory. Such a shame he’s not in France this time around.The riders are congregating in Albi – we’ll have some racing very soon.This is how today’s finish shapes up:Fancy it could be a day for Caleb Ewan to finally get a win under his belt, but we shall see.As this stage is short and pretty damn flat there’s a slightly later start today – racing will get under way around 12.45pm BST with the sprint to the line coming at around 4.30pm. One man who won’t be on the startline is Rick Zabel, the Katusha-Alpecin rider has the flu and has had to withdraw from the race.While we wait for things to get going here’s some rest day news from our man in France, Jeremy Whittle:Rest day can often bring some pretty decent #content from teams across their social media channels. It’s not Tour-related but I thought this from EF Education First on the GBDuro event was a really good watch:I can’t see anything changing much in these today (fact fans: the yellow jersey has never changed hands on a stage to Toulouse). Hello all. Hope you’re all feeling refreshed after a hard-earned rest day. Today the peloton blasts across Tarn, from Albi to Toulouse. It’s a day for the sprinters, the last one for a while with the first taste of the Pyrenees coming up on Thursday. That said, if Monday’s madness tells us anything it’s to take nothing for granted in this bike race.Here’s what William Fotheringham has to say about today’s stage:An amuse-bouche before the serious general classification racing begins, this is a short and probably rapid sprint stage across the south of France with only an early third-category climb to trouble the sprinters. There will be a break, but there are only two more sprint stages after this, so the fastmen will want their teams to control the race."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5750ac80bccd17180c74145a71a9af0837cc8134/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b342efe89192b7cd7eb2cbbae1b9e5c","title":"amazon faces eu inquiry over treatment of small retailers","story":"Investigation into possible anti-competitive behaviour is likely to spark US angerThe European Union has launched a formal investigation into Amazon, opening a new front against US tech giants.Announcing the decision, the European commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, said she wanted to take “a very close look” at whether Amazon’s business practices broke EU anti-trust rules.The investigation into another US company seems bound to provoke the ire of the White House, only weeks after Donald Trump said Vestager “hates the United States perhaps worse than any other person I’ve ever met”.The Danish commissioner, due to leave her role in the autumn, has won international recognition for her tough action on US tech companies such as Google and Apple when Brussels investigations found either an abuse of market power or underpayment of corporate taxes. The commission has always insisted its actions are targeting anti-competitive behaviour rather than singling out companies by nationality.The latest investigation will assess the agreements between Amazon and the thousands of independent retailers that sell goods on its site. After a preliminary investigation launched last year, the commission said Amazon appeared to use “competitively sensitive information” from those independent retailers.The formal investigation, launched on Wednesday, will study how the use of this data affects competition, with a focus on Amazon’s “buy box”, which allows customers to add items from a specific retailer directly into their shopping carts.“E-commerce has boosted retail competition and brought more choice and better prices,” Vestager said. “We need to ensure that large online platforms don’t eliminate these benefits through anti-competitive behaviour.“I have therefore decided to take a very close look at Amazon’s business practices and its dual role as marketplace and retailer, to assess its compliance with EU competition rules.”The commission said the announcement of the investigation did not prejudge the outcome."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f237ebad83038a6bad5935f35a776a8028da3c4/0_109_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c109570b99853b96241bb64772302847","title":"send tip off the tourist trail europe twin 200 pound hotel voucher","story":"You might know a hidden-but-wonderful village, town, historic site, landscape or beach.

If there is one quality the European commission’s first female president shares with her mentor Angela Merkel, it is that her political persuasions can be difficult to classify. Unlike Germany’s consensus-seeking chancellor, however, she is not afraid to raise hackles and ide opinion to drive through the policies she believes are right.Born in October 1958, Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen spent her first 13 years in Brussels, where her father was one of the first pan-European civil servants. She attended the European School in Uccle, graduating two years before a certain Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson joined the same establishment.One of seven children, she was raised in a Christian household that adhered to the traditional model of the West German nuclear family. As state premier of Lower Saxony, her father, Ernst Albrecht, became a leading figure of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and a bete noire for the burgeoning Green movement, with whom he clashed over the opening of a nuclear waste depository.Her mother, Heidi, took a supporting role, at times leading a family choir that serenaded its patriarch on German TV shows, and stating: “The best way for me to gain the respect of the public is through the role of motherliness.”But if her father’s career enabled her international upbringing, it also allowed Von der Leyen to step out from his shadow.When she was studying economics at the University of Göttingen in the late 1970s, her father was informed that his family could be a potential target for the Red Army Faction, a terrorist group also known as the Baader-Meinhof gang, and that his daughter should consider moving to another university.Von der Leyen adopted the pseudonym Rose Ladson – a combination of her family nickname and the surname of her American great-grandmother – and enrolled at the London School of Economics.“I lived much more than I studied,” she told the weekly Zeit. “No details, please. Only this: in 1978 I immersed myself for one year in this seething, international, colourful city. For me, coming from the rather monotonous, white Germany, that was fascinating.“For me, London was the epitome of modernity: freedom, the joy of life, trying everything. This gave me an inner freedom that I have kept until today. And another thing I have kept: the realisation that different cultures can get on together very well.”Switching to study medicine, she later worked as an assistant physician at a women’s clinic in Hanover and graduated as a doctor of medicine in 1991.After she joined the CDU in 1990, on the same day her father stepped down from his job as state premier, her inner freedom made its mark on the posts she held, first as a regional and national delegate and then at the family, work and defence ministries.“She has an incredible amount of energy”, said Daniel Goffart, a political correspondent for the news magazine Focus who co-wrote her biography in 2015. “You especially saw that in her bitter and protracted battle to modernise her party’s view on the role of the family.”Under her watch, Germany introduced a law guaranteeing every child over 12 months of age a place at a daycare facility, and a paid parental leave scheme that includes at least two months of paid leave for fathers. She forced Merkel to drop her opposition to boardroom quotas for women, even though the policy was later defeated in the Bundestag.Married since 1986 to a physician, Heiko, and mother to seven children, Von der Leyen has juggled a prolific career with family life – at the cost of popularity within her own party, some say. Instead of attending CDU summer fetes in rural Lower Saxony, said her biographer Goffart, she preferred to spend weekends at the family home in Beinhorn near Hanover when her children were still young.Among her critics, the 60-year-old Von der Leyen has a reputation as an Einzelgängerin, a lone wolf with an instinct for front page-grabbing interviews and photo ops, but lacking the gift to pass the inner freedom driving her career down to the teams she works with.If Von der Leyen’s approval ratings have recently plummeted, making her the least popular minister in Merkel’s cabinet, it is because her handling of Germany’s notoriously under-funded military at times displayed those same deficiencies.When she diagnosed the troops with an “attitude problem” after the emergence of stories about rightwing extremist activities and hazing of new recruits, she was accused – and not only by members of the Bundeswehr – of choosing a good write-up over loyalty to her staff. “If she has a weakness, it is her tendency to excessive stage management,” said Goffart.More recently, Von der Leyen grabbed negative headlines over the accusation that her defence ministry had allocated over-inflated contracts worth hundreds of millions of euros to external consultants. A parliamentary committee is investigating the ministry for accusations of nepotism, and Von der Leyen is expected to be invited as a witness in December. In Brussels and Berlin, she will have two stages to manage.• This article was amended on 17 July 2019.

Germany’s armed forces, which critics maintain have long been chronically underfunded, are consistently accused of inefficiency and of having inadequate or defective equipment.Originally thought likely to go to the ambitious young health minister, Jens Spahn, the defence job has been labelled “the ejector seat” of German politics, after derailing the careers of several ministers who have held it.Von der Leyen, once seen as a potential chancellor, became one of Germany’s least popular politicians during her five years in the post.Kramp-Karrenbauer’s colleagues welcomed the appointment. “When such an important position, a core job in the cabinet, becomes available, then a CDU leader must step up and take responsibility, and she is doing that,” said Ralph Brinkhaus, the leader of the CDU parliamentary caucus.“If you want to show leadership you don’t consider the risk, you get on with the job. In life as in politics, there are always risks. If you don’t trust yourself to take on hard tasks, you don’t belong in politics.”Sometimes called the “mini-Merkel”, Kramp-Karrenbauer has been poised to take over as chancellor since becoming CDU leader in December after Merkel announced she would not seek another term when her current term ended in 2021.But she has failed to connect effectively with voters, many of whom see her as out of touch, and came in for strong criticism after the party’s record-low performance in the European parliamentary elections in May.After a succession of gaffes obliged Merkel to publicly dismiss reports that she had reached the conclusion her chosen successor was not up to the job, Kramp-Karrenbauer recently said she wanted to concentrate on reforming and reuniting the party rather than taking a ministerial job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b66f388b0e13b6550d66aa46509bef68e36edbad/7_4_2552_1532/master/2552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72064a1b263c4c4a2242a96c2c6755d6","title":"the best things in life are free but where are they","story":"From amber fishing in the Baltic to mushroom hunting in Russia, there’s lots of stuff that doesn’t cost a pennyby  Ruth Maclean,  Kate Connolly,  Justin McCurry,  Hannah Ellis-Petersen,  Michael Amundsen,  Sam Jones,  Michael Safi and  Angelique ChrisafisIn Russia, mushroom picking is called the “quiet hunt” and it has a ritual all its own. From late spring through to autumn, the high season for mycophiles, Russians fan out into the forests in search of fresh air, solitude and fungi to fill their wicker baskets. Should you see Ladas and Range Rovers abandoned roadside after a downpour, do not be alarmed: it is just mushroom season, not the zombie apocalypse.The prey depends on the season: morels in spring, then pine boletes, broad milkcaps, orange chanterelles and the prized boroviki, the porcinis or penny buns that crown the season before the first snowfalls.Yes, Pushkin and Leo Tolstoy wrote about mushroom hunts. But for a more hallucinogenic offering, turn to the Bolshevik functionary Alexander Tolstoy, who wrote a fairytale about talking mushrooms complaining how painful it is to be eaten, trampling a poisonous mukhomor and then shoving their way into the mouths of two children with the cry “All right, kids, open up!”Soviet labour unions sometimes rented out buses to send factory workers off for a day of mushroom picking as a kind of teambuilding exercise. But the quiet hunt is really about leaving everything behind – our troubles, our devices, and often our loved ones – and communing with forests of birch and pine until we emerge again, our burden a little lighter.Well, most of us emerge. Each year, dozens of Russians go missing and only stumble out weeks later in a kind of trance state. Others become so hopelessly lost that they are never found at all.• Andrew Roth in MoscowIndians are born negotiators, and everything in Delhi has a price. But twice a day, tens of thousands of people file into the city’s largest Sikh temple, take their place on their floor and eat a simple meal of vegetables, daal and roti – without paying anything.The langar, or communal kitchen, is a pillar of the Sikh religion. At the Bangla Sahib gurudwara in Delhi, an estimated 35,000 people are fed each day in a ritual symbolising the faith’s commitment to equality and eradicating hunger.“For everyone who comes it is free of cost,” says Harbhej Singh, who runs the langar. “It doesn’t ide anyone by caste, creed or culture. It’s for everyone.”In a culture that has traditionally been riven by the caste system, an intricate south Asian social hierarchy whose rules include who can and cannot prepare food or eat together, the 500-year-old langar tradition is still a radical statement.“The main motive is to remove these class differences,” Singh says. “Whether it’s a foreigner, a minister, or anyone, they all sit together. A beggar might be sitting next to you, but you both eat.”Preparing the meal involves thousands of volunteers as well as staggering quantities of food. On an average day, the kitchens prepare 450kg of lentils, 1,800kg of flour, 300kg or rice and 900kg of vegetables, most of it garnered through donations.And will the temple ever start charging? Singh is emphatic. “It will never happen.”• Michael Safi in DelhiWhen the initiative to make public transport free for residents in Estonia’s capital Tallinn was introduced six years ago, it was seen as something of a throwback to the communist era.No matter. It’s predictably popular. Across ages, genders, mother tongues and ideologies, free public transport has become something that residents expect and value. The scheme has encouraged people to sign on as residents of Tallinn with the city’s population registry. This has increased the tax base and improved revenues. Proponents of free public transportation in Tallinn have pointed to gains in the city’s income that far outweigh the loss of fares.“I couldn’t do without it,” says Mari-Liis Kade, 20, a barista at the coffee chain Reval Café in Tallinn’s old town who commutes in from a suburb 10km away.“Young people generally don’t earn much in Estonia by EU standards,” she adds. “If you take home €300-€400 a month, which is common in the service industry, you can see why a free mode of transport is a great benefit.” A ride on the bus or tram in Tallinn is €2 for non-residents.“But it’s not just the money,” she continues. “It’s as much about convenience. It’s great to just jump on the 1A bus, ping my (Tallinn Transport) card and not have to worry about the fare. I definitely use the bus more because it is convenient in my community but also for getting to other places. Tourists think of Tallinn as just the Old Town and centre but it’s actually quite a spread-out city.”And is free public transport alleviating traffic snarls? “Well, the people of Tallinn are addicted to driving. I don’t know how much it has helped with that. But for those of us without cars, free public transportation is a godsend. It definitely encourages my friends and I to go into the city more often.”• Michael Amundsen in TallinnEver wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theA hazy dusk descends on Dakar’s coastal strip as hundreds of men and women work out, undeterred by the heady blend of harmattan dust and diesel fumes.Recently, China gave Senegal an improbable number of outdoor fitness machines – a vast row of glinting seafront metal. Surely there are not enough fitness freaks to necessitate even a quarter of the pull-up bars, pec decks and leg-swinging contraptions that interrupt the view?But by evening, they are full. Dakarois take fitness seriously. Packs of men jog up and down the city’s chinks of beach, turning shoal-like every 50 metres to cover the same ground hundreds of times. Other groups do aerobics, play football or wrestle as the traffic splutters past. The most creativity is brought to bear on elaborate synchronised press-up routines: with legs crossed one way then the other, elbows in then splayed out, then holding each other’s legs aloft.On a recent weekday evening on Yoff beach, a group did frog jumps en masse, first forwards, then back. Wrestling is equally popular, and you will often find a ring of spectators egging on two skimpily-dressed but deadly serious men circling each other before launching themselves at each other’s waists.At Dakar’s biggest and most prestigious gym, the Olympique Club, staff confide that some of the country’s most famous wrestlers often come to work out – but add that they preen a little more than they train. Senegalese boys are as likely to tell you that they want to be wrestlers as footballers, which goes some way to explain the citywide pursuit of “musculation”.Often sensible of gifts that are likely to be popular, China has cottoned onto that too – their donation of a large wrestling arena was inaugurated in Dakar last summer.• Ruth Maclean in DakarAmber fishing is a popular pastime for visitors to the Baltic Sea coast. I’ve been doing it in the islands off northern Germany with my children ever since they were babies. Requirements are: the immediate aftermath of good storm, coupled with an onshore wind, after which you should make your way to the beach in the early morning to beat the other “Bernstein Fischer” (amber anglers). Take a scoop net – known as a kescher – to drag over the sea bed, and if you’re really serious, a pair of waders, or waterproofs that reach as far as your oxters and enable you to walk through the breakers, and possibly even a rope fastened to the shore to stop you being swept out to sea. Still keen?The idea is that a storm loosens the amber nuggets – believed to be around 44m years old – from the sea bed, and once it’s relatively calm again, the “golden tears of the Baltic”, as they are typically referred to, are either to be found floating among the concentration of disturbed shells, seaweed and driftwood or, if you’re lucky, washed up on the beach.The most likely time of the year is between November and March, when storms are most common. The sea must be cold.Patience and luck is required to find the best gems, and the most magical finds include pieces with insects encased in them, or the rarer green moss amber, and sometimes even blue chunks. But we have always been thrilled by the tiniest find – some little bigger than a pinhead. Other orangey-coloured stones on the beach can easily be mistaken for amber. But its lightness, hollowness and softness (tapping them against your teeth and biting into them helps to identify the real stuff) helps distinguish them from stones and pebbles. Polished them up is as easy as using a duster dipped in dry washing powder, and rubbing it over the nugget.Make a hole in it (local amber shops are usually happy to do this for a small fee), insert a thread, and you have the perfect unique holiday souvenir.• Kate Connolly in BerlinNow that the dawn tuna auctions at Tsukiji fish market have moved to more clinical surroundings, arguably the best possible early start to a day in Tokyo is a visit to a sumo stable. Several heya allow visitors to sit in on training sessions, although reservations are recommended to guarantee getting close enough to take in the slapping of sweaty flesh and the sweet scent of the wrestlers’ bintsuke hair oil. The Arashio stable has an English-language page on its website, but restricts visitors to watching the action through a window.Visitors arriving in Japan in the next few weeks will have to be incredibly unlucky not to catch a glimpse of the springtime sakura – or cherry blossoms – whose pale pink petals appear at different intervals the length of the archipelago. The blossoms’ ubiquity means you are never far from a park or riverbank to indulge in a spot of hanami flower viewing and ponder the ephemeral nature of life as the petals float to the ground, not to be seen for another year. A Japanese picnic and a plentiful supply of beer and sake are optional, but recommended.• Justin McCurry in TokyoThey move with a stealth and speed that belies their years, materialising suddenly at pedestrian crossings, on cafe terraces and in tube carriages. They carry sweets, gooey compliments and, above all, centuries of accumulated wisdom and opinion. They are the grandmothers of Spain, and they are not shy.Undoubtedly the most assiduous worshippers of children in a country where kids possess semi-ine status no matter how infernal their true natures, the abuelas are always keen to talk, ruffle hair and magic up tissues for snotty young noses.Their chief function, however, is the imparting of parenting advice – whether solicited or not. God help the mother or father who dares to venture out without wrapping their offspring in at least two more layers than is strictly necessary. Being a guiri (foreigner) will not serve as mitigation.There is something wonderful about these daily displays of affection and about the way old and young communicate in Spain. To be a child here is to be seen, to be heard and to be engaged with. And, obviously, to be fussed over relentlessly. I sometimes wonder whether the children and the grannies don’t share some secret signal long lost to the eyes and ears of the generation that sits between them.Perhaps it is something learned, forgotten and then rediscovered over the course of a life. Perhaps it’s just the smell of sweets.• Sam Jones in MadridShrines are scattered across Bangkok, dedicated to deities, gods, ghosts and spirits. In a city where the luxury mall is king, they serve as a spiritual counterbalance to the ever growing number of Louis Vuitton boutiques and on days when Bangkok feels overwhelmingly urban, I go and seek out some of the weirder and more wonderful ones. And the Chao Mae Tubtim shrine is certainly weird, and certainly wonderful.The modest shrine, tucked away in a park in the hectic centre of Bangkok, is dedicated to the Chinese fertility goddess Tubtim, and since 1920 has been where women hoping to conceive have come with a phallic offering – mostly in the form of a penis sculpture. It is a shrine dedicated to the power of the female and there is something both so endearing and so defiant about seeing the image of a goddess with hundreds of penises – big and small hot pink, red, black, brown and ornately decorated some piled up on a gold platter, laid out before her like a phallic congregation standing to attention.Another favourite is the shrine dedicated to Mae Nak, one of Thailand’s most famous ghosts. As the myth goes, she was so in love with her husband that when she died in childbirth she returned to the world and pretended to him she was still alive – until unfortunately he noticed she could walk through solid objects. Then there is Trimurti shrine, known as the lovers’ shrine and always strewn with red roses: a joy to encounter in the midst of a crowded, polluted Bangkok junction.In a city of chaos, the shrines offer a moment of stillness. And whether I’m sitting in the company of a lovesick ghost or in a sea of phalluses, they offer a window into the spiritual side of Thai society that can otherwise be easy to miss.• Hannah Ellis-Petersen in BangkokFrom summer outdoor cinema in deckchairs in northern Paris to December’s monumental, nocturnal light creations in central Lyon, France has a vast array of free festivals all year long. The Atlantide international book festival held in the western city of Nantes in early spring each year – and currently run by the acclaimed Congolese novelist Alain Mabanckou – is among the best literary festivals in Europe, attracting top writers. And it doesn’t cost a cent to attend.Local festivals such as the Fêtes d’Arvor in Vannes, southern Brittany, are about celebrating regional traditions and culture. Others such as the Techno Parade in Paris each September are more about hundreds of thousands of fans taking over the city centre in a giant, free street party.The Parc de la Villette in northern Paris stages a summer free open-air cinema where people can bring their own picnics and watch films from Yellow Submarine to La La Land. In October, Paris also stages its Nuit Blanche nocturnal art trail, where people roam the city into the early hours looking at art installations in buildings and courtyards that they might not otherwise have access to.Even France’s more than 16,000 public libraries – over four times the number of libraries in the UK – regularly stage their own free events, such as the Paris libraries which decamp to parks on certain days in summer.Many of the most popular festivals are in smaller locations, like Saint-Louis on the Swiss border, well known for its free summer open-air music festival, Conç-Air.Lyon’s December Festival of Lights – one of the region’s key tourism events – sees top artists create giant, cutting-edge light projections and installations in the city centre.

An outline of proposed legislation for reforming the Higher Education Authority Act was approved by the Cabinet in recent days.Third-level colleges face a series of stringent penalties for misconduct including having funding withheld under the biggest shake-up to regulation of higher education in almost 50 years.The measures, to be announced by the Government in the coming days, have sparked controversy within some universities who fear the planned moves will undermine their long-standing autonomy.An outline of proposed legislation for reforming the Higher Education Authority Act – which dates back to 1971 – was approved by the Cabinet in recent days.• Carry out reviews into the performance or governance of third-level colleges with the co-operation of staff and full access to internal documents• Appoint an “observer” to sit on governing bodies of colleges where there are concerns• Withhold or request a refund of State grants in cases where there they have been misused• Issue “non-financial penalties” such as admonishments taking into account any professional regulatory regimes or impose more stringent HR requirements• Remove higher-education institutions from a list of “designated” institutions under certain circumstances.Name changeThe planned legislation would also change the name of the Higher Education Authority (HEA) to the Higher Education Commission. The planned legislation follows Minister of State Mary Mitchell O’Connor’s announcement last year of plans to reform higher-education governance.However, there is alarm within some universities which fear the move will undermine long-standing rules which protect the autonomy of the sector.There are also concerns among some senior academics that the move could result in more power being consolidated in the Department of Education.“At a time when less and less money is going into higher education, control of the sector is on the increase. It’s eroding our autonomy,” said one source.However, Government sources insist that the moves are simply an attempt to place many of the HEA’s existing functions on a statutory footing.“The legislation for the higher-education sector hasn’t kept pace with the developments in the sector.

Photograph: Jason ClarkeMr Martin said his party in government would seek a “broader reconfiguration” of the departments as there was not “enough thought” put into the structures of some of those established in recent times. The Cork South Central TD said the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Department of Rural and Community Development got off to “a very difficult start”. “There will be a broader reconfiguration of government departments in terms of our overall plan for government which will involve a separate higher education and research department, and that will mean a reconfiguration of other departments – the specific areas we haven’t yet decided on, but that’s quite a doable proposition,” he told reporters on Tuesday. Mr Martin said there is “absolutely” a need for both a department of higher education and research and department of education. “Because of the packed agenda within education at the moment, from a policy perspective, higher education tends to get marginalised in the wider debate of primary, second level, special needs education, curriculum reform and all of that,” he added. The Government is due to announce proposed legislation in the coming days that will introduce a series of penalties for third-level colleges for misconduct. Mr Martin said universities and third-level institutions need “far more than a system of penalties”. “There’s a lot of what we might call shadowboxing going on and PR stuff but a lack of substance behind that.”The Fianna Fáil leader addressed the Irish Universities Association’s inaugural Future of Ireland series on Tuesday. He said higher education and research is under “real pressure”, which is likely to get “much, much worse in the next decade unless we start acting now”. “The creation of a separate department of higher education and research might be the only way to guarantee both the real priority for this area and to provide strategic leadership,” he said. “Such a department would have critical mass in terms of size and budget and would mean that for the first time we will have a senior political and administrative leadership, whose sole responsibility would be to focus on higher education and the wider research and knowledge agenda.”Mr Martin said he is absolutely opposed to the current “political attempt” to bring Ministers and Government departments “back into the decision making structures for research awards”. “Last year’s National Development Plan is full of proposals such as the disruptive technologies programme which allow Ministers the final say and bypass awards procedures which has so consistently worked in the past,” he said.

Sport Ireland chairman Kieran Mulvey and its chief executive John Treacy told the Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport it was their clear understanding that the entire board would be standing down.At the weekend it emerged that outgoing president Donal Conway is the sole person nominated to continue in his role, while vice-president Noel Fitzroy has also been nominated to return but faces competition from two others.  Mr Ross wrote to Mr Conway on Tuesday asking him to withdraw his nomination. In a response, the board of the FAI pointed to a recommendation of a review group that at least one, and at most two, outgoing members of the board remain in situ to avoid the risk of a loss of knowledge and experience. Mr Mulvey told the committee, chaired by Fine Gael TD Fergus O’Dowd, that Sport Ireland understood “very clearly and unequivocally that the board would be standing down and would not be standing up again.“I have no difficulty with the view of the Minister.” Mr Treacy said it was his view that no member of the current board should go forward to the new one. He said Sport Ireland had told the FAI that this was its view at a meeting last Friday. LeadershipMr Treacy said that Mr Conway had shown leadership, especially with the roadshows that the FAI is holding around the country, and that needed to be acknowledged. “He did steady the ship,” he said. “Our view is it’s now time to hand it over and get on with new people.”Aidan Horan, a governance expert who chaired the independent review group that examined the FAI, said it reached a conclusion that to avoid a risk of knowledge being lost it might be best to have some element of continuity.“We suggested that there should be some consideration of having one, or two, of the existing board (remaining in place) to smooth the handover.”However, committee members including Mr O’Dowd, Catherine Murphy and Noel Rock expressed the view there should be a total clear-out, as did the Sport Ireland representatives.Mr Treacy also told the committee that the investigation by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement was “a serious and very substantial” one. He said a number of other investigations were continuing including a forensic audit and internal audits. “It may show up (findings) that are embarrassing to the former board. Our preferred view is that nobody would stand for the new board,” he said. “A new beginning would happen. There is also a big piece around public trust.”He said that new leaders needed to step forward from the membership of the FAI but that this had not happened. DifficultyMr Mulvey told the committee that Sport Ireland had immense difficulty hiring forensic accountants with firms in the State reluctant to do so because of reputational risk. In response to questions from Mr O’Dowd about the accounts, he said the annual accounts would not be ready for the AGM.“We will not be restoring funding until we have a full set of accounts,” he said. He said the main message from the review group was the lack of governance that had been in place in the FAI and even when elements existed, they were not in place. “The governance report is about changing the FAI and its culture and to separate the management of football and the management of business,” he said. Mr Treacy later said the process around the reform of the FAI was like a marathon and “we are only at the three or four mile mark at the moment.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3957998.1563307573!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ursula von der leyen elected european commission president","story":"EU Commission presidential candidate Ursula Von der Leyen says that one of her priorities in the Brexit negotiations is maintaining peace on the island of Ireland. Video: EU Parliament\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerman defence minister Ursula von der Leyen, who has been elected European Commission president by 383 votes, with 327 voting against. Photograph: Francois LenoirReutersAverting the possibility of a major EU inter-institutional rift, MEPs on Tuesday night in Strasbourg confirmed Germany’s defence minister Ursula von der Leyen as the EU’s next commission president.Ms Von der Leyen, a member of the centre-right European People’s Party, who was nominated two weeks ago by the EU leaders’ summit, saw her election narrowly ratified by 383 votes to 327. She needed 374 for a majority. The tightness of the margin may affect the European Commission’s ability to get its legislative programme through.Speaking on Tuesday morning during the ratification debate, Ms Von der Leyen sent a strong conciliatory message to the UK in declaring that she would support another Brexit extension beyond October, “should more time be required”.She said of the Brexit decision, to jeers from Brexiteers, that “we regret it but respect it” and reiterated the EU position that the Withdrawal Agreement as it stands “provides certainty where Brexit provides uncertainty” on citizens’ rights and peace and security on the island of Ireland.Important signalThe decision to allow a further Brexit extension will be one for EU leaders in the council, but Ms Von der Leyen’s words, certainly spoken after consultation with European Council president Donald Tusk, will be seen as an important signal to London that it may have more space to negotiate.The MEPs’ vote on her nomination – formally speaking, it is they who “elect” her – is the final piece in a complex political package deal between leaders, in which they agreed the share-out of the EU top jobs between the union’s leading parties. Gender and geographical balance were also part of the equation, which ultimately depended on the willingness of MEPs to take instruction from national party leaders.The presidency of the council has gone to Belgian Charles Michel, a member of the liberal Renew Europe group, while Spanish socialist foreign minister Josep Borrell was appointed high representative for foreign and security policy. France’s Christine Lagarde is to head the European Central Bank.Ms Von der Leyen was supported by her own EPP group, which had won the recent European election, by the centre-left Socialists and Democrats, with defections from its German ranks, and by the liberal Renew Europe group.Impassioned speechMs Von der Leyen gave an impassioned speech to MEPs in which she stressed her deep commitment to European values, not least the rule of law, and promised to put climate change at the top of her agenda. She said she would work to democratise the union, bringing the commission and MEPs closer together. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOnce her presidency is ratified, Ms Von der Leyen will start the process of liaising with national leaders over their nominees for commissionerships, and on Tuesday she put down a strong marker that she will insist on a 50-50 male-female commission.\u0026nbsp She warned that if member states refuse to supply her with female names she will not hesitate to turn nominees down.\u0026nbspSources suggest, however, that she is unlikely to resist the renomination of male commissioners such as Ireland’s Phil Hogan.Parliament votes on the commission as a block after inidual hearings in September."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Comment: Ursula von der Leyen is gearing up to be the most hardcore EU-federalist Commission President in historyUrsula von der Leyen will struggle to keep promises she made to get elected as new European Commission president Manchester Arena bomber\u0026#39s brother extradited from Libya\u0026#39Going to the dump now is like going through customs\u0026#39:  readers on the rubbish-tip \u0026#39tax\u0026#39China issues 17,000 smart watches to pupils to track movementsDriver guilty of terror attack outside Parliament Andrea Camilleri, author of Inspector Montalbano novels, dies at 93  Comment: Fanatical Von der Leyen is the final nail in the coffin for shambolic EU \u0026#39democracy\u0026#39Ex-partner of pregnant woman stabbed to death in London admits responsibility for killing herWith Corbyn on the ropes Boris Johnson could win a huge electoral majority in a matter of monthsThousands of criminals spared jail last year despite having more than 50 convictions to their nameNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe being transferred to psychiatric hospital raises hopes for release, husband saysLabour peers take out newspaper advert to tell Corbyn he is \u0026#39failing the test of leadership\u0026#39Boris Johnson vs Jeremy Hunt: The final two Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 policy pledges in fullUK enjoys partial lunar eclipse on 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 moon mission launchBolshoi Ballet star Eleonora Sevenard: ‘It’s nerve-racking for my boyfriend to dance with me’Eoin Morgan told his England side to \u0026#39calm it\u0026#39 at No 10 drinks with PM to avoid repeat of 2005Comment: Erdogan\u0026#39s gone too far.

GPS is a system developed and owned by the US government.“With this watch, Mom and Dad can know where I am, and I can call and voice message them immediately after class,” one enthusiastic fourth-grader told state media.The smart watch-tracking government program is entirely voluntary and about half of the devices distributed have already come online. Plans are in place to issue another 13,000 smart watches to students, and the authorities will soon begin handing them out to elderly people.User information will be uploaded to a database maintained by China’s ministry of public security and the ministry of industry and information technology, according to state media.Cities in China have been getting creative in finding new ways to monitor students and curb truancy with the latest technologies.In December, more than ten schools in Guizhou and Guangxi provinces began requiring students to wear “intelligent uniforms” embedded with computer chips to track their movements and trigger an alarm if they skip class, according to state media.China sent a satellite of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System into space in JuneTwo chips, sown into the shoulders of school jackets, can sustain around 500 wash cycles and temperatures of 150 degrees Celsius.Facial recognition scanners at school gates match the chips with the correct students, meaning anyone who tries to swap jackets in order to play truant will be caught. Alarms will also sound if a pupil falls asleep in class.Last May, a high school in Hangzhou installed facial recognition technology to check how attentive pupils were in class.Movements of students are watched by three cameras positioned above the blackboard, and can pick up seven different emotions, including neutral, happy, sad, disappointed, angry, scared and surprised. If the technology concludes a student is distracted in class, it will send a notification to the teacher to take action.BeiDou was originally developed by the Chinese military to reduce reliance on the US-owned GPS system, but its positioning accuracy is to within 10 metres while GPS can track down to 30 centimetres.In efforts to speed up adoption of the system, Chinese authorities have ordered taxis, buses and other vehicles to install BeiDou, and many domestic phone brands including Huawei and Xiaomi are now also compatible with the system.There are only a handful of other global satellite navigation systems, including Russia’s Glonass and Europe’s Galileo, which has suffered an outage over the last two weeks.The UK has been involved in developing Galileo, sinking £1.2 billion in the project, but now intends to build its own as part of Brexit fallout.Ursula von der Leyen will struggle to keep promises she made to get elected as new European Commission president Manchester Arena bomber\u0026#39s brother extradited from LibyaComment: Ursula von der Leyen is gearing up to be the most hardcore EU-federalist Commission President in history\u0026#39Going to the dump now is like going through customs\u0026#39:  readers on the rubbish-tip \u0026#39tax\u0026#39Driver guilty of terror attack outside Parliament Andrea Camilleri, author of Inspector Montalbano novels, dies at 93  Comment: Fanatical Von der Leyen is the final nail in the coffin for shambolic EU \u0026#39democracy\u0026#39Ex-partner of pregnant woman stabbed to death in London admits responsibility for killing herWith Corbyn on the ropes Boris Johnson could win a huge electoral majority in a matter of monthsThousands of criminals spared jail last year despite having more than 50 convictions to their nameNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe being transferred to psychiatric hospital raises hopes for release, husband saysLabour peers take out newspaper advert to tell Corbyn he is \u0026#39failing the test of leadership\u0026#39Boris Johnson vs Jeremy Hunt: The final two Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 policy pledges in fullUK enjoys partial lunar eclipse on 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 moon mission launchBolshoi Ballet star Eleonora Sevenard: ‘It’s nerve-racking for my boyfriend to dance with me’Eoin Morgan told his England side to \u0026#39calm it\u0026#39 at No 10 drinks with PM to avoid repeat of 2005Comment: Erdogan\u0026#39s gone too far.

Everything was in good spirits and it was a fantastic day for English cricket, starting with the children at the Oval and ending at Downing Street.There was certainly no danger of any rude words being uttered in that song and Eoin quickly told them to calm it. The players had been on their best behaviour after a celebrations the previous night when the alcohol was still flowing at 4am at the Landmark Hotel, London.Prime Minister Theresa May with England cricket captain Eoin Morgan and the trophy outside Downing StreetBefore attending Downing Street, the cricketers put on a brave face through the hangovers at they met hundreds of adoring children as part of a celebration at the Oval.Mrs May, who was at England’s dramatic tournament win against New Zealand at Lord’s, had been gushing with praise for the players during the reception, and is likely to recommend the entire team for honours in the New Year’s list.Want the best of The  direct to your email and WhatsApp?

followThe IndependentEvery person in the UK could be given a monthly idend to spend on fresh, healthy, locally produced food as part of radical proposals to reform the farming system and avert the twin crises of climate change and deteriorating public health.A “beetroot bond” would nudge people to buy healthy food and shift local communities away from unsustainable large-scale agricultural practices that produce large amounts of unhealthy food and contribute to environmental degradation, according to a report from a commission set up by the Royal Society of Arts (RSA).Alongside the bond, which would be government-funded, people would also become “shareholders” in their local food system with the ability to influence decisions on which types of produce will effectively be subsidised, such as local and seasonal, organic or other high-welfare, plastic-free or fairly traded.It is one of the more eye-catching ideas among plans laid out by the RSA’s Farming \u0026amp Countryside Commission, which argues the UK farming and food system must be urgently and radically reformed if we are to stem rising temperatures and rates of obesity and diabetes.The research involved farmers and supermarkets as well as health and environmental groups and thousands of conversations with rural residents.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all

the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.It concluded that, while agricultural and economic policy has focused for the past 70 years on producing more food more cheaply, this has come with unintended consequences that have moved many of the costs elsewhere.“More intensive farming practices are not necessarily more productive or more profitable,” the repost states.Even though Britain has some of the lowest food prices in Europe, it has the highest rate of food poverty. The poorest 10 per cent of households need to spend 74 percent of their disposable income after housing costs on food to meet the Eatwell Guide, a policy tool used by government to define a healthy diet.Type 2 diabetes, which is associated with a high-sugar and high-carbohydrate diet, now eats up 10 per cent of the NHS budget, a figure that is expected to rise to 17 per cent by 2035.Tesco suspends \u0027ethical\u0027 farm over \u0027disgusting\u0027 abuse of chickensMeanwhile, farming accounts for 83 per cent of global ammonia emissions that contribute to air pollution and 11 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.“Time is now running out. The actions that we take in the next 10 years are critical: to recover and regenerate nature and to restore health and wellbeing to both people and planet,” the report states.\u0026nbspThe commission recommends the government implements a “polluter pays” principle so that the true costs of food production, including on the environment and public health, are borne by the businesses that benefit.To accomplish this requires a “strong and escalating” regulations that put pressure on businesses to end practices that deplete public value.Another key pillar of the proposals is to simplify the “jungle of labels” that consumers face when trying to decide on healthy and environmentally friendly food, and to provide better, simpler and clearer information.Other ideas floated in the Our Future in the Land report include ramping up production of healthy British food such as fruit, vegetables, nuts and pulses, with the help of a national agro-ecology development bank that it is hoped would attract long-term investors to fund a transition to sustainable farming.Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary Michael Gove said: “This report raises issues that are hugely important for changing the way we produce food in this country when we are outside of the EU\u0027s Common Agricultural Policy.”Mr Gove has previously said the UK would have more freedom to pursue a greener farming policy after Brexit.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Housing costs were also deducted to account for income differences between outright homeowners, mortgage holders and renters.\u0026nbspThe recent drop in incomes forms part of a wider stagnation in living standards since the financial crisis, caused primarily by a severe slowdown in productivity growth, the Resolution Foundation said.\u0026nbsp“Restoring this – via greater investment in skills and capital across the UK, and resolving Brexit uncertainty – should be a top priority for the next prime minister,” it added.Rising output per hour accounted for two-thirds of\u0026nbspthe UK\u0027s overall economic growth before the financial crash, but just\u0026nbspover a fifth of growth since then, the report noted. Population growth has replaced productivity gains as the engine of economic expansion since 2007.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBritain predicted to fall into recession after no-deal BrexitAverage household incomes\u0026nbsphave been propped up since then by\u0026nbspmore people entering work and a halt to a century-long decline in working hours.The researchers also found that income inequality has “rocketed” over the past half-century and called on the next leader of the country to ensure a more equal distribution of income growth.However, that is the opposite of what the ongoing leadership campaign has focused on, they said\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspin apparent criticism of Boris Johnson, the frontrunner, who has promised to raise the threshold at which the higher rate of income tax kicks in. The move was widely criticised as handing more money to the better-off.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

followThe IndependentEvery person in the UK could be given a monthly idend to spend on fresh, healthy, locally produced food as part of radical proposals to reform the farming system and avert the twin crises of climate change and deteriorating public health.A “beetroot bond” would nudge people to buy healthy food and shift local communities away from unsustainable large-scale agricultural practices that produce large amounts of unhealthy food and contribute to environmental degradation, according to a report from a commission set up by the Royal Society of Arts (RSA).Alongside the bond, which would be government-funded, people would also become “shareholders” in their local food system with the ability to influence decisions on which types of produce will effectively be subsidised, such as local and seasonal, organic or other high-welfare, plastic-free or fairly traded.It is one of the more eye-catching ideas among plans laid out by the RSA’s Farming \u0026amp Countryside Commission, which argues the UK farming and food system must be urgently and radically reformed if we are to stem rising temperatures and rates of obesity and diabetes.The research involved farmers and supermarkets as well as health and environmental groups and thousands of conversations with rural residents.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all

the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.It concluded that, while agricultural and economic policy has focused for the past 70 years on producing more food more cheaply, this has come with unintended consequences that have moved many of the costs elsewhere.“More intensive farming practices are not necessarily more productive or more profitable,” the repost states.Even though Britain has some of the lowest food prices in Europe, it has the highest rate of food poverty. The poorest 10 per cent of households need to spend 74 percent of their disposable income after housing costs on food to meet the Eatwell Guide, a policy tool used by government to define a healthy diet.Type 2 diabetes, which is associated with a high-sugar and high-carbohydrate diet, now eats up 10 per cent of the NHS budget, a figure that is expected to rise to 17 per cent by 2035.Tesco suspends \u0027ethical\u0027 farm over \u0027disgusting\u0027 abuse of chickensMeanwhile, farming accounts for 83 per cent of global ammonia emissions that contribute to air pollution and 11 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.“Time is now running out. The actions that we take in the next 10 years are critical: to recover and regenerate nature and to restore health and wellbeing to both people and planet,” the report states.\u0026nbspThe commission recommends the government implements a “polluter pays” principle so that the true costs of food production, including on the environment and public health, are borne by the businesses that benefit.To accomplish this requires a “strong and escalating” regulations that put pressure on businesses to end practices that deplete public value.Another key pillar of the proposals is to simplify the “jungle of labels” that consumers face when trying to decide on healthy and environmentally friendly food, and to provide better, simpler and clearer information.Other ideas floated in the Our Future in the Land report include ramping up production of healthy British food such as fruit, vegetables, nuts and pulses, with the help of a national agro-ecology development bank that it is hoped would attract long-term investors to fund a transition to sustainable farming.Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary Michael Gove said: “This report raises issues that are hugely important for changing the way we produce food in this country when we are outside of the EU\u0027s Common Agricultural Policy.”Mr Gove has previously said the UK would have more freedom to pursue a greener farming policy after Brexit.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Population growth has replaced productivity gains as the engine of economic expansion since 2007.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBritain predicted to fall into recession after no-deal BrexitAverage household incomes\u0026nbsphave been propped up since then by\u0026nbspmore people entering work and a halt to a century-long decline in working hours.The researchers also found that income inequality has “rocketed” over the past half-century and called on the next leader of the country to ensure a more equal distribution of income growth.However, that is the opposite of what the ongoing leadership campaign has focused on, they said\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspin apparent criticism of Boris Johnson, the frontrunner, who has promised to raise the threshold at which the higher rate of income tax kicks in. The move was widely criticised as handing more money to the better-off.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention.

Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. Ed Sheeran’s new album is bland, sincere and hygienically preparedWhy do celebrities find it so hard to play themselves?Intriguingly, the Moscow statue is not the first time Sheeran has served as inspiration for a statue. In 2016, a Sheeran-inspired pig statue wearing a plaid shirt and sporting messy red hair was planted in Ipswich, near Sheeran’s hometown of Framlingham. Named “Ed Sheer-Ham”, the statue was met with support from Sheeran himself.“I’m really excited to have a pig sculpture made in my honour,” he said in a statement.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Following on from the option to choose the skin tone of the characters, users will now be able to select different combinations of skin tones.That means that the emoji intended to represent relationships – the two people of different genders holding hands – can each be changed up to ensure they look more like the people they represent. It allows for more than 75 possible combinations of different skin tones, Apple said.The company also revealed a set of new disability-themed emoji, which include a new guide dog, an ear with a hearing aid, wheelchairs and a prosthetic arm and leg. Celebrating ersity in all its many forms is integral to Apple’s values and these new options help fill a significant gap in the emoji keyboard, Apple claimed in a release.Apple had lobbied with the Unicode Consortium to allow those emoji to come to the keyboard. Though Apple designs the little images itself, what they are is decided by a group of different technology companies to ensure the images look similar across platforms – so adding new ones can be a long and bureaucratic process.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment.

This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)The footage was released on Thursday by Ningaloo Marine Interactions, the tour company which Mr Wilton works for.The hero himself suggested it was all in a day’s work.First known nursery for giant manta rays discovered in Gulf of Mexico“I’m often guiding snorkellers in the area and it’s as if she recognised me and was trusting me to help her,” he said.“She got closer and closer and then started unfurling to present the eye to me. I knew we had to get the hooks out or she would have been in big trouble. I went for a few es down to see how she’d react to me being close to her.”When the animal stayed calm, he approached and took out the hooks.The manta stayed completely still in the water,” he said.“It’s pretty incredible behaviour if this is what happened,” said David Boyle, lecturer in marine biology at the University of Plymouth. “It’s not uncommon for animals – generally mammals – to interact with ers but for one in distress to seek out assistance would be novel indeed.”Manta rays are believed to be some of the most intelligent creatures in the ocean. Unlike stingrays, they don’t have an external spike and are generally harmless to humans.Experts believe the injured eye would have become infected, leading to blindness and possible death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How many years between sequel and original? SevenIt wasn\u0027t until the arrival of Austin Powers sequel The Spy Who Shagged Me that Mike Myers\u0027s comic creations were fully wedged into the hearts of film lovers. If the original was the perfect introduction to Austin\u0027s groovy world, the follow-up was an altogether funnier, bigger and more quotable affair. How many years between sequel and original? TwoCapping off not only your own franchise but a decade-long series consisting of 22 films is no mean feat – and yet Avengers: Endgame balanced all the playing pieces to do so with gargantuan success. How many years between sequel and original? Seven437 Back to the Future Part II (1989)The first sequel to Robert Zemeckis\u0027s Back to the Future is an amusing adventure that sees Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travel... well, back to the future, to prevent his own son from sabotaging the family legacy. How many years between sequel and original? FourIt was the addition of both Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito – as Catwoman and the Penguin, respectively – that made Tim Burton\u0027s sequel Batman Returns an even more memorable watch than the original. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeEach instalment of Richard Linklater\u0027s Before trilogy is as good as the last.

How many years between sequel and original? NineThere\u0027s a blistering chase sequence midway through The Bourne Ultimatum involving Matt Damon\u0027s amnesiac spy and journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine).

How many years between sequel and original? Five837 Bride of Frankenstein (1935)Depicting Mary Shelley\u0027s classic creature as a pleasant guy just looking for a companion, Bride of Frankenstein is one of the greatest monster movies, let alone sequels, in cinema history. How many years between sequel and original? FourBatman Begins may have been the perfect origin story for the caped crusader, but nothing could have prepared film fans for the classic its sequel would become. Christopher Nolan intelligently crafted The Dark Knight into one of the greatest follow-ups ever made, with several standout action sequences and an untouchable performance from Heath Ledger as the Joker. One for the ages. How many years between sequel and original? Three1037 Dawn of the Dead (1978)George A Romero ditched the entire cast of Night of the Living Dead for its first sequel, Dawn of the Dead, which showed the effects of the zombie apocalypse on a much larger scale than depicted in the black-and-white original. One of the most entertaining horror films ever made.  How many years between sequel and original? 10The glory you feel watching Hellboy II: The Golden Army comes from the knowledge that you\u0027re watching a studio allow Guillermo del Toro to do whatever the hell he wants. A scintillating oddity of a follow-up that surpasses the 2004 original within minutes. How many years between sequel and original? FourNot so much an improvement on the first as one that rips up its rule book completely: Sam Raimi took the character of Ash (Bruce Campbell), who viewers first met in influential 1981 horror The Evil Dead,\u0026nbspand placed him in the heart of what is essentially a slapstick comedy. How many years between sequel and original? SixAfter the lacklustre fourth instalment, Fast \u0026amp Furious 5 was the reinvention the series desperately needed. Bringing in Dwayne Johnson as the bad guy was a genius stroke and the final set-piece – a car dragging a bank vault through the streets of Rio – remains as entertaining as anything the long-running series has ever done. How many years between sequel and original? 10The Godfather Part II set the highest benchmark for what sequels should be, but so rarely are – a crucial chapter in a saga. The film won Robert De Niro an Oscar for his efforts, playing the same role Marlon Brando won an Oscar for two years before. This, alongside another film on this list, is one of two sequels to ever win Best Picture (keep scrolling to find out the other one). How many years between sequel and original? Two1537 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)The fact that Sergio Leone had barely any money to make The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – the third film in his Man With no Name trilogy – fortuitously led to the casting of the relatively unknown Clint Eastwood. Leone\u0027s film, beautifully soundtracked by Ennio Morricone, is a masterwork that proves less is more: its most classic dialogue-free scenes derived from the fact that Leone had no time to shoot dialogue. How many years between sequel and original? Two1637 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)Gone was the warm glow of Hogwarts in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s adaptation of the JK Rowling novel proved the franchise could win widespread acclaim, as well as ticket receipts, if put in the hands of interesting directors. How many years between sequel and original? Three1737 How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)Could How to Train Your Dragon endure as one of the most beloved yet underrated franchises of all time? Quite possibly – and its first sequel, which features breathless flight sequences and animation to marvel at, is solid evidence of this. How many years between sequel and original? FourDespite essentially rehashing the plot of the first film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a bolder, more exciting and, yes, deadlier outing for Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s heroine Katniss Everdeen. How many years between sequel and original? One1937 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)If Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade isn\u0027t better than series opener Raiders of the Lost Ark, it\u0027s certainly as good. This is thanks to the addition of Sean Connery\u0027s Henry Jones Sr – the father of Harrison Ford\u0027s whip-cracking archaeologist. How many years between sequel and original? EightPerhaps it was down to relief that Iron Man 3 was so revered by critics (lest we forget Iron Man 2 is one of Marvel\u0027s biggest duds). But, Robert Downey Jr\u0027s third solo outing as Tony Starl boasts enough laughs and thrills, not to mention a doozy of a twist, that earns its placement on this list. How many years between sequel and original? FiveLethal Weapon 2 takes what made the original so fun – the wit and twist-filled action – and amps it up as far as it can possibly go. That it throws in Joe Pesci for good measure just makes the results even more sizzling. How many years between sequel and original? TwoLogan rectified the mistakes of Wolverine\u0027s earlier standalone films thanks to James Mangold\u0027s decision to place the character in a far grittier film than he was used to (it was rated 15 in the UK). The result remains a perfect send-off to one of X-Men\u0027s greatest characters, who first played the role in 2000.How many years between sequel and original? 17Gareth Evans\u0027s sequel to The Raid is more of the glorious same, only – somehow – more ambitious. Two hours and 30 minutes of breathlessly-paced fight sequences that\u0027s unlike anything caught on film before. How many years between sequel and original? Three2437 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)The second sequel to ever win Best Picture is all about the payoff. While each film in Peter Jackson\u0027s Lord of the Rings trilogy delivers in what it needs to, this final chapter balances all the plates to dish out an epic conclusion that surely would have been everything JRR Tolkien wanted from an adaptation of his classic novels. How many years between sequel and original? TwoNobody could have predicted quite how breathlessly entertaining Mad Max: Fury Road would be. George Miller\u0027s dystopian chase film refuses to relent from the very first second and is just as entertaining with every watch – and far superior to the Mel Gibson original, which was released in 1979. How many years between sequel and original? 36There has never been a bad Mission: Impossible film. However, since Christopher McQuarrie stepped into the fold as director, the series has taken just as many audacious leaps as its lead star, the stunt-loving Tom Cruise. Fallout is a multi-layered, twisty action film that will undoubtedly go down as a franchise classic. How many years between sequel and original? 22All it took was the spirit of Christmas for the Griswolds to get the film they deserved. Chevy Chase heads up this one liner-filled festive treat that\u0027s probably the only Vacation film worth your time. How many years between sequel and original? FourOne critic described Paddington 2 as the Godfather Part II of Peruvian Bear movies and they were not wrong. The sequel somehow manages to convey more charm than the original – which in itself is extremely charming – and has the benefit of starring Hugh Grant as a villainous actor named Phoenix Buchanan. A delight. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeAll eyes were on Shrek 2 thanks to the unprecedented success of the fantastic original, which was released in 2001. What people didn\u0027t expect, though, was that the follow-up would be just as hilarious and even more enchanting. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeSam Raimi managed to outdo himself with Spider-Man 2 (the first one remains a superhero standout) with help from Alfred Molina\u0027s Doctor Octopus and some nightmarish scenes in which the Evil Dead filmmaker delves into his bursting bag of horror movie tricks. How many years between sequel and original? Two3137 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)By placing the emphasis on character as opposed to action, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan righted the wrongs of the classic TV show\u0027s first big screen adventure, a dud that was released in 1979. The result is a staggeringly improved follow-up. How many years between sequel and original? thREEThe Empire Strikes Back would make this list for its twist alone, which ranks as one of the greatest in cinema history, but the film also represents so much more. Episode V established the Star Wars franchise\u0027s staying power by proving A New Hope was no fluke. How many years between sequel and original? Three3337 War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)With War for the Planet of the Apes, Fox\u0027s closing chapter of the rebooted trilogy, Matt Reeves delivered a near-faultless arthouse film parading as a mo-cap monkey-filled blockbuster. How many years between sequel and original?  SixIt would have been easy to chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane\u0027s acclaim to the fact it was a secret up until a month before it was released. The fact remains, though, that this spiritual successor to 2008 found-footage thriller Cloverfield is a gruellingly tense chamber piece that\u0027s even more nail-biting than the first. How many years between sequel and original? EightThose who believed you couldn\u0027t get a more groundbreaking film than The Terminator likely burst a vessel after watching Judgement Day, a sequel that reshaped what people wanted from their action movies forevermore. It did so while subverting expectation in the most simplest of ways – by turning Arnie\u0027s killing machine, the terrifying villain in the first, into a cuddly force for good. How many years between sequel and original? SevenWhen Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok.

SixSure, the third and fourth instalments might have the emotional payoffs, but –\u0026nbspthanks to a series of standout scenes (the traffic cone pileup, anyone?) – it\u0027s Toy Story 2 that stands tall as the best of Pixar\u0027s sequels.

How many years between sequel and original? Three1737 How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014)Could How to Train Your Dragon endure as one of the most beloved yet underrated franchises of all time? Quite possibly – and its first sequel, which features breathless flight sequences and animation to marvel at, is solid evidence of this. How many years between sequel and original? FourDespite essentially rehashing the plot of the first film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a bolder, more exciting and, yes, deadlier outing for Jennifer Lawrence\u0027s heroine Katniss Everdeen. How many years between sequel and original? One1937 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)If Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade isn\u0027t better than series opener Raiders of the Lost Ark, it\u0027s certainly as good. This is thanks to the addition of Sean Connery\u0027s Henry Jones Sr – the father of Harrison Ford\u0027s whip-cracking archaeologist. How many years between sequel and original? EightPerhaps it was down to relief that Iron Man 3 was so revered by critics (lest we forget Iron Man 2 is one of Marvel\u0027s biggest duds). But, Robert Downey Jr\u0027s third solo outing as Tony Starl boasts enough laughs and thrills, not to mention a doozy of a twist, that earns its placement on this list. How many years between sequel and original? FiveLethal Weapon 2 takes what made the original so fun – the wit and twist-filled action – and amps it up as far as it can possibly go. That it throws in Joe Pesci for good measure just makes the results even more sizzling. How many years between sequel and original? TwoLogan rectified the mistakes of Wolverine\u0027s earlier standalone films thanks to James Mangold\u0027s decision to place the character in a far grittier film than he was used to (it was rated 15 in the UK). The result remains a perfect send-off to one of X-Men\u0027s greatest characters, who first played the role in 2000.How many years between sequel and original? 17Gareth Evans\u0027s sequel to The Raid is more of the glorious same, only – somehow – more ambitious. Two hours and 30 minutes of breathlessly-paced fight sequences that\u0027s unlike anything caught on film before. How many years between sequel and original? Three2437 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)The second sequel to ever win Best Picture is all about the payoff. While each film in Peter Jackson\u0027s Lord of the Rings trilogy delivers in what it needs to, this final chapter balances all the plates to dish out an epic conclusion that surely would have been everything JRR Tolkien wanted from an adaptation of his classic novels. How many years between sequel and original? TwoNobody could have predicted quite how breathlessly entertaining Mad Max: Fury Road would be. George Miller\u0027s dystopian chase film refuses to relent from the very first second and is just as entertaining with every watch – and far superior to the Mel Gibson original, which was released in 1979. How many years between sequel and original? 36There has never been a bad Mission: Impossible film. However, since Christopher McQuarrie stepped into the fold as director, the series has taken just as many audacious leaps as its lead star, the stunt-loving Tom Cruise. Fallout is a multi-layered, twisty action film that will undoubtedly go down as a franchise classic. How many years between sequel and original? 22All it took was the spirit of Christmas for the Griswolds to get the film they deserved. Chevy Chase heads up this one liner-filled festive treat that\u0027s probably the only Vacation film worth your time. How many years between sequel and original? FourOne critic described Paddington 2 as the Godfather Part II of Peruvian Bear movies and they were not wrong. The sequel somehow manages to convey more charm than the original – which in itself is extremely charming – and has the benefit of starring Hugh Grant as a villainous actor named Phoenix Buchanan. A delight. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeAll eyes were on Shrek 2 thanks to the unprecedented success of the fantastic original, which was released in 2001. What people didn\u0027t expect, though, was that the follow-up would be just as hilarious and even more enchanting. How many years between sequel and original? ThreeSam Raimi managed to outdo himself with Spider-Man 2 (the first one remains a superhero standout) with help from Alfred Molina\u0027s Doctor Octopus and some nightmarish scenes in which the Evil Dead filmmaker delves into his bursting bag of horror movie tricks. How many years between sequel and original? Two3137 Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982)By placing the emphasis on character as opposed to action, Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan righted the wrongs of the classic TV show\u0027s first big screen adventure, a dud that was released in 1979. The result is a staggeringly improved follow-up. How many years between sequel and original? thREEThe Empire Strikes Back would make this list for its twist alone, which ranks as one of the greatest in cinema history, but the film also represents so much more. Episode V established the Star Wars franchise\u0027s staying power by proving A New Hope was no fluke. How many years between sequel and original? Three3337 War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)With War for the Planet of the Apes, Fox\u0027s closing chapter of the rebooted trilogy, Matt Reeves delivered a near-faultless arthouse film parading as a mo-cap monkey-filled blockbuster. How many years between sequel and original?  SixIt would have been easy to chalk up 10 Cloverfield Lane\u0027s acclaim to the fact it was a secret up until a month before it was released. The fact remains, though, that this spiritual successor to 2008 found-footage thriller Cloverfield is a gruellingly tense chamber piece that\u0027s even more nail-biting than the first. How many years between sequel and original? EightThose who believed you couldn\u0027t get a more groundbreaking film than The Terminator likely burst a vessel after watching Judgement Day, a sequel that reshaped what people wanted from their action movies forevermore. It did so while subverting expectation in the most simplest of ways – by turning Arnie\u0027s killing machine, the terrifying villain in the first, into a cuddly force for good. How many years between sequel and original? SevenWhen Taika Waititi took the keys to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he walked away with one of its greatest films: Thor: Ragnarok. The finished product is Asgards apart from the first of the hero\u0027s two adventures, starring Chris Hemsworth, that were released in 2011 and 2013. How many years between sequel and original? SixSure, the third and fourth instalments might have the emotional payoffs, but –\u0026nbspthanks to a series of standout scenes (the traffic cone pileup, anyone?) – it\u0027s Toy Story 2 that stands tall as the best of Pixar\u0027s sequels. How many years between sequel and original? FourBuckley and his co-stars came together for The Inbetweeners: Fwends Reunited reunion special in January, which viewers described as “awkward”. Buckley later admitted on his podcast Completed It Mate that he had “come across as a complete moron” on the show.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Aldi’s basket included its own-brand\u0026nbspVeuve Monsigny champagne.A further line stated: “Save 45 per cent”, while small text at the bottom of the page said: “Tesco may sell ‘own-brand’ products at different prices.”Tesco complained that the champagne products included in the selection unfairly skewed the price comparison in Aldi’s favour, and that the advert did not make sufficiently clear that Tesco also sold alternative\u0026nbspchampagne products that were cheaper than Moet.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Inveraray pipe band parades through the town at the start of the Highland Games in Inverarary, ScotlandExtinction Rebellion Activists block roads near the Tron Clock tower in GlasgowSerbia\u0027s Novak Djokovic raises the winner\u0027s trophy after beating Switzerland\u0027s Roger Federer during their men\u0027s singles final on day thirteen of the 2019 Wimbledon Championships at The All England Lawn Tennis ClubThe referee counts Nathan Gorman out as Daniel Dubois looks on during the British Heavyweight Title fight between Daniel Dubois and Nathan Gorman at The O2 Arena in LondonGiant Panda, Yang Guang, exploring his new home at Edinburgh Zoo after moving in last weekEngland\u0027s captain Eoin Morgan, left, celebrates with teammate Joe Root after winning their Cricket World Cup semi-final match against Australia at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

The aerobatic display team have been granted formal approval on Wednesday to perform for audiences, known as Public Display Authority (PDA), to mark the official start of the Red Arrows\u0027 55th display seasonBritish Environment Secretary Michael Gove returns to his home following a run in London.In its defence Aldi\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspthat comparing own-brand and branded products was\u0026nbsp“inherently permissible”, adding that its own\u0026nbspchampagne was the second-most popular on the market –\u0026nbspafter the Moet to which it was compared.But the\u0026nbspAdvertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld Tesco’s complaint, ruling that Aldi had given consumers the overall impression they could make significant savings generally by switching their loyalties.\u0026nbspIt noted that the Aldi champagne was priced at £11.49, while the Moet\u0026nbspcost £28, accounting for more than half the price difference between the two baskets.The ASA said: “Given that there were other lower and mid-range priced champagnes available at Tesco, both branded and unbranded, which would be considered by price-conscious consumers to be more comparable with the Aldi product, we considered that the inclusion of the Moet product in the basket of goods skewed the comparison and was likely to mislead consumers.”It added: “We told Aldi to ensure that when making multi-product comparisons in future they did not imply that consumers could make more general savings if the claim was based only on a specific selection of goods, rather than a typical weekly shop.“We also told them to ensure that their selection of comparator products did not mislead.”An Aldi spokesman said: “This was a one-off seasonal advert published more than seven months ago. The ruling does not impact our ongoing Swap and Save adverts, which clearly show how much shoppers can save by switching to Aldi.”Additional reporting by PAOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And with more light coming through, this will create a new habitat and encourage new species to grow.”He added that he hoped the reintroduction of these “charismatic species” to the wood will encourage visitor to think about the issues of climate change and rewilding.“We\u0027re excited that people are starting to recognise the value of British woodland, which is often overlooked when zoos concentrate on more exotic locations such as the African savannah and rainforest.“We have a unique change to reach out to people so they can recognise the importance of our ancient woodland that remains.”Last month, the government passed a law to cut\u0026nbspgreenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.One of the ways the government’s Committee on Climate Change say this target can be achieved\u0026nbspis by offsetting emissions by planting trees and creating woodland.\u0026nbsp“Ancient woodland is one of the richest habitats for wildlife in the UK, providing a home for hundreds of species of animals and plants,” explained Dr Christoph Schwitzer, chief zoological officer at Bristol Zoological Society.“In order to protect what remains, we need to inspire the next generation about the importance of this unique habitat. We believe that the best way to do this is to immerse people in these woods and show them the amazing ersity that is at stake.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Improved output per hour had accounted for two-thirds of economic growth ahead of the crash, but only 22 per cent in the decade after it.In the absence of productivity growth, households have shored up their incomes by working more, with employment three percentage points higher than in 2007.Eight million working people trapped in relative povertyThe rise of ‘survival sex’ is a crushing legacy of austerity\u0027Ideological\u0027 Tory austerity causing poverty, pain and misery, says UNMillennials face record levels of working-age poverty, report finds And the long-term trend which saw the working week reduce by an hour every four years over the past century has now ground to a halt, with workers putting in an average 32 hours, just as they did in 2007.The Foundation warned that households were “running out of road” in terms of opportunities to maintain income levels by working more, as the UK’s employment rate is already at its highest level since the Second World War.Instead, the new prime minister arriving in Downing Street next week should seek to stimulate productivity and improve employment and earning opportunities for women.Just as the expansion of paid maternity leave and free childcare improved family incomes by allowing more women to work, policies such as reforming Universal Credit to better support households’ second earners into employment will be needed in the coming years, said the report.The Foundation’s senior economic analyst Adam Corlett said: “The living standards history of the past 25 years tells us that there are two broad ways that families have traditionally got richer over time – higher pay off the back of rising productivity, and supporting more women into work.“After an unprecedented income squeeze over the past decade, and a living standards outlook that includes child poverty rising to record levels, an economic approach that supports higher incomes for all households must be the top domestic priority for the incoming PM.”\u0026nbspMr McDonnell will use the launch of the Audit to announce Labour\u0027s \u0026nbspnew commitment to ending in-work poverty over the course of the next parliament, which is currently due to cover the years 2022-27, but could be brought forward by a snap election.He will say: “The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said last year that ‘in-work poverty is the problem of our times’.“I am committing today to ending this modern-day scourge, to eliminating in-work poverty by the end of Labour’s first full Parliamentary term.”As Chancellor in the next Labour Government, I want you to judge me by how much we reduce poverty and how much we create a more equal society. By how much people’s lives change for the better. Because that is our number one goal.”Mr McDonnell will say that Labour policies to introduce structural change to the economy, improve public services and reform social security will all be needed to meet the target of a “sustained eradication of poverty (and) dramatic narrowing of inequality”.And he will confirm Labour’s rejection of the concept of “social mobility” which has underpinned the agendas of governments of all stripes over the past 40 years.“Behind the concept of social mobility is the belief that poverty is OK as long as some people are given the opportunity to climb out of it, leaving the others behind,” he will say.“I reject that completely, and want to see a society with higher living standards for everyone as well as one in which nobody lacks the means to survive or has to choose between life’s essentials.“A rejection of the belief that it’s OK if your local factory closes, as long as you have cash transfers from the finance sector in the South-East or a new warehouse opening on the edge of town paying minimum wage on its zero-hour contracts.“Ending poverty won’t just be done in the workplace: we need to make sure the essentials of life are never denied to people because of their circumstances.“So parents aren’t forced to choose between feeding themselves and feeding their children or the unemployed teenager doesn’t give up on job interviews because they cost £5 in bus fares each time.“We need a structurally different economy, a social safety net of shared public service provision, and of course a financial safety net as well.“Without any one of these three elements, we will not be able to achieve the sustained eradication of poverty, the dramatic narrowing of inequality, and the transformation of people’s lives that will be the central purpose of the next Labour Government.”Responding, Conservative Party chairman\u0026nbspBrandon Lewis said:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Labour’s plans for the economy would lead to worse living standards and harm the people they claim they want to help the most.“Just this week we have seen wages rise by their fastest in 11 years, giving people more money in their pockets, and record numbers of people getting the security of a wage.“Thanks to our balanced approach, we’ve also cut taxes for 32 million people, taking millions of the lowest-paid out of paying income tax altogether, and taken action to reduce the cost of living”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She needed 374 votes to reach the threshold to be elected, meaning she scraped through by just nine votes.Ms Von der Leyen, who was nominated by EU leaders earlier this month,\u0026nbspis the first woman to hold the top job in Brussels. The European Commission is the union’s executive arm and is responsible for proposing EU law, enforcing its treaties, and representing the interests of the bloc as a whole on the world stage.\u0026nbspShe is due to take office on 1 November after a handover period during which her cabinet of commissioners, one from each member state, will be chosen and their portfolios allocated. She has pledged to achieve gender balance in the top team – but could face a showdown with member state governments, who may have other candidates in mind as their commissioners.The German politician’s appointment is controversial because she\u0026nbspwas not a lead\u0026nbspcandidate in the EU elections last month. The European parliament had previously said that the next commission president should have been on the ballot paper during the contest and campaigned across the EU, under the so-called “spitzenkandidat” system.New EU commission cabinet will be half women, says Juncker replacementUrsula von der Leyen: the German minister set to run the EUEU leaders back Ursula von der Leyen to be commission presidentBut a majority of\u0026nbspMEPs gave Ms Von der Leyen their backing anyway after national leaders called their bluff and proposed a candidate who was not available to vote for. She was opposed by MEPs from the green and left groups in the parliament, but supported by the centre-right and the liberals. The centre-left socialist group was split, with some countries’ parties such as the German SPD opposing the appointment and others such as Labour supporting it.“The trust you placed in me is the confidence you placed in Europe,” she told MEPs in her acceptance speech.\u0026nbsp“Your confidence in a united and a strong Europe, from east to west, from south to north. Your confidence in a Europe that is ready to fight for the future rather than fighting against each other. Your confidence in a Europe that will take the big challenges of our times together. The task ahead of us humbles me: it is a big responsibility and our work starts now.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Rescuers work at the site of collapsed building in Dongri area of Mumbai, IndiaA motorist drives past a destroyed house after a large earthquake that hit Surigao City, in the southern island of Mindanao, Philippines French Gendarmes remove fences next to a burning portable toilet during clashes with protesters on the Champs Elysees avenue after the traditional Bastille Day military parade in Paris, FranceA recortador jumps over a bull during a contest in a bullring at the San Fermin festival in Pamplona, SpainJapan\u0027s Megumu Yoshida and Yukiko Inui compete in the duet technical artistic swimming event during the 2019 World Championships at Yeomju Gymnasium in GwangjuHot air balloons fly over the city of Igualada during an early flight as part of the European Balloon Festival in Igualada, Spain.

Most of them answered the question honestly but had a decent dig at each other as they went.All in all, a very entertaining debate filled with fun # and some news too.In just a week’s time we will know which of these two men will be your next Prime Minister.Thanks to everyone for watching, and our fantastic readers for sending in their questions.We’ll have all the reaction from outside Sun Towers to the debate coming up.And on talkRADIO Ross Kempsell will have all the analysis of the last hour’s debate.And now it’s time for our quick-fire round of questions, to finish off the debate.# climate change target of net zero emissions by  keep it  Boris: YesHunt:Yes# continue to freeze fuel duty, like the last  years Boris: Not making any more spending commitments.

One Lord was described as a “notorious bullying pervert” by a Westminster worker.The verdict was that the prevailing culture and behaviour in the House of Lords “has not been conducive to an open and supportive culture to ensure all those working there are treated with dignity and respect”.Worse, the report concluded those staff on the receiving end of bullying and harassment generally did not complain because they thought nothing would change, or feared reprisal.Clearly, the House of Lords has issues. But it’s nowhere near as bad as the House of Commons. The second report, by Gemma White QC into inappropriate conduct in Westminster, concluded MPs’ staff face “unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment”.It found sexual harassment in Parliament is seen by young staff as a “necessary evil”they want to progress. Witnesses describe speaking out against any abuse as “career suicide”.Even though both reports state only a small minority of MPs or Lords behave in unacceptable ways, this has been tolerated for too long and shining a light on it will bring about change.What’s clear to me, both from reading the report and working at the House of Lords, is that this is a generational issue. The House of Lords is full of older people stuck in a time warp.Many of them live in a world where it’s still acceptable for women — often females of a lower status to them — to be patted on the bottom or on the head.The House of Lords can feel a bit like a boys’ boarding school, or Hogwarts. It’s populated predominantly by old white men, many of whom lead a le insulated from the real world.That said, the worst behaviour I witness is usually in the library, where Lords often retire after lunch and which rings with the sound of ear-deafening snoring and, I am sorry to say, farting.The only time I’ve ever seen anyone being actively rude was when one Lord commanded a member of canteen staff to get him a bag of crisps. He was so close he could have reached out and got it himself.I’ve also been on the receiving end of the odd condescending comment, such as when a Lord looked me up and down and said: “You’re dressed rather casually.” I was wearing Stella McCartney trousers at the time, so not exactly jeans.Crucially, though, I wasn’t wearing a dress. So I looked him up and down and said: “Dressing casually is better than dressing badly” — and that was the end of that.It must be horrible to work in an organisation where you feel inferior and can’t speak your mind — and,you do, people either shrug or shut you down. The report about the House of Lords suggested it should be mandatory for all employees to go on a “how to value people” course. Some people might see it as unnecessary — but we send West Ham staff on them and they are good.But that’s not the only change required. There’s neither enough women, nor cultural ersity. The only way that will change is by electing a more erse chamber.In the meantime, I hope this report does not diminish, in people’s minds, the important legislation work the House of Lords does and the role it plays in holding the Commons to account. I hope these reports don’t stop people from remembering what an important institution it is.As Spider-Man said: “With great power comes great responsibility” — and as one who sits in the House of Lords, I know I am not the only one who feels it is a great responsibility.BIG news. MPs have voted to make same-sex marriage legal in Northern Ireland.By a massive margin of  to , the House of Commons backed an amendment demanding the province be brought into line with the rest of the country by October  . . . unless Stormont s and decides otherwise.

Those results came after MPs hijacked a Government Bill in a bid to force through the changes.The DUP has accused them of abusing the impasse at Stormont to impose Westminster’s will. So not everyone is happy with the news.But it’s a big “Hooray!” from me that this kind of right-minded thinking now applies to the whole UK. After all, women have the right to choose what happens to their bodies.And what dference does it make – and whose business is it  – who you love and make love to I FEEL for Donna Bettiss, who is selling her unworn wedding dress after her fiance left her for their wedding planner.Donna, , from Horsham in West Sussex, was devastated when partner James Routledge, , dumped her last year just weeks before their big day. He then started a relationship with work colleague Paige Hannington, , who had helped the couple organise their wedding.Let’s hope Donna gets back the £, the dress is worth. What a cad. Leaving your bride-to-be for the wedding planner is NOT a good look.The only consolation – though Donna might not see it quite yet – is that she is almost certainly better off without him.WHEN I heard a Hull mum had called two of her children Jackdaniel and Tiamarie, all I could think was, “poor kids”.But mum Sarah Mennell insists they aren’t named after booze, as she prefers tea.

Pundits give him an agonising  days from next Tuesday to honour that promise.In fact, we will know in an instantBrexit — and Boris — will live or die.The moment will come, perhaps on his first day, as he names the man or woman to prise the Treasury from the cold, dead hands of Chancellor Philip Hammond.If Boris picks Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock or Liz Truss — or anyone  who voted Remain — .million Brits can kiss goodbye to their dream of leaving the European Union.We will end up with a just another bodged version of Theresa May’s BRINO sell-out — Brexit in Name Only. It will be the beginning and the end of King BoJo the First.There will be no second chances. The next Chancellor of the Exchequer must be a proven Brexiteer in word and deedBoris has a chance of surviving his  days.The Treasury is the most powerful and implacable enemy of Brexit. “The new Chancellor needs three key qualities,” says a source close to Boris.“They must have a Brexit pedigree, absolute loyalty to Boris and the intellectual self-confidence to take on Whitehall and the Treasury.”Qualities such as these are scarce in the present Cabinet. The final choice is likely to surprise everyone, especially Remainers.Some names mentioned to me would, to say the least, offer a bracing challenge to pro-EU establishment fanatics who spent the past three years sabotaging the  referendum.Unless the new Chancellor takes them head-on, those forces will crush both Boris and Brexit. Observers have identied the tank traps and sniper nests facing the new PM.He is up against a Remain-dominated Parliament aided by slippery Speaker Bercow, an army of civil service mandarins skilled in the machinery of government and covering fire from BBC propagandists.In the face of such overwhelming odds, a pro-Leave PM is surely doomed to fail. Not so. Despite appearances, Boris has a plan.He will fly immediately to Brussels with a genuine bid to reopen Theresa May’s botched withdrawal agreement.He would seek a clear path out of the EU customs union, single market and European Court jurisdiction, plus a sensible solution to the Northern Ireland border issue.The alternative will be for Britain to leave the EU on October  with No Deal. Unless much has changed, Brussels will say: “Non!” Boris will announce he has no option but to call a snap “No Deal” election.Remainers are appalled at the idea, and for good reason. Poll after poll suggests No Deal Boris would win with an outright majority — at their expense.The public is sick to the back teeth with Theresa May’s dreary defeatism and Brussels’ bullying. Remain voters want this sorted, too.Elections are always risky. But a Tory Party still dithering and paralysed on the biggest issue of the age is the greatest risk of all. Right now, the omens are promising. Labour is committing ritual suicide, shedding voters in droves.Millions of Tory defectors would flock back to a party committed to a final, irreversible Brexit taking us past the October  dead-line and sucking support from Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party.In the intervening weeks, a Boris regime could recruit voters abandoned by both major parties over crime, low pay, high taxes and housing.According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, blue- collar voters on less than £, a year, are “up for grabs like never before”.If Boris Johnson has one proven gt, it is for winning against the odds. In fact, despite gloom-mongers, the odds could not be better.To quote Boris, there is an appetite among voters for optimism . . .  stepping off the “hamster wheel of doom”. So brace yourselves for an early general election, folks — and round two of King BoJo.In a PC world gone mad, this is surely the moment to bring in the men women gender non-specic folk in white coats.People now risk losing their livelihoods for invented “hate crimes” on transgender bullying, Islamic extremism or mass immigration.Now Theresa May is transiting into Big Brother by threatening to punish newspapers who publish embarrassing leaks.It is George Orwell’s nightmare novel  brought terryingly to le.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has threatened journalists, too, that they face prosecutionthey dare to publish the content of the cables.Trying to justy his threats, the Met’s Assistant Commissioner, Neil Basu, said he was sure the leaks had “damaged UK international relations” and on that basis no one publishing the leaks could plead a public interest defence.What a ludicrous over-reaction to what is really no more than a diplomatic spat over the Ferrero Rochers.Sure, it doesn’t exactly help UK US relations when our Ambassador calls the President of the United States “inept” and his administration “uniquely dysal”.But I would say it is mildly less damaging than some of the things that the Leader of Opposition, the Mayor of London and Scotland’s First Minister have said about Donald Trump. I can’t see Mr Basu dangling his handcuffs in front of them — and neither should he.Obviously, Sir Kim has reason to feel aggrieved that someone — presumably in the diplomatic service or the Foreign Office, because there is no evidence of computers being hacked — has leaked information he intended to be private. But it is a matter for the Government to investigate, not the police.How ridiculous Basu has said of the leaker: “You are now also responsible for erting busy detectives from under-taking their core mission.”No, Mr Basu — it is only thanks to your decision that officers have been taken off front-line duties to undertake this investigation.You could have told officials what police officers are forever telling the rest of us when we report our houses broken into or our bikes stolen: Sorry, but we’ve got too much  to do.It would be a dferent mattersomeone had leaked material that really did harm national security.The sort of information leaked by Kim Philby and his Soviet-sympathising accomplices in the s put British lives at risk.But leaking and publishing a diplomat’s private thoughts hardly comes into that category. Mr Basu’s attack on the principles of the free Press echoes Operation Elveden, the failed attempt by the Met to criminalise journalists who had obtained information from police officers, in some cases for money.The Met switched more than  police officers from other duties and arrested  people. The police probe cost taxpayers £.million and yet of  journalists charged, only one was convicted at trial — and that was quashed on appeal. Just one journalist, Dan Evans, pleaded guilty to an Elveden offence and was given a suspended sentence.The prosecutions relied on an ancient offence, Misconduct in Public Office, which was only ever supposed to apply to public servants, not journalists.As many lawyers, including the Lord Chief Justice, pointed out, it simply isn’t a criminal offence for someone to receive or to publish most forms of state information — only for a public official to sell it.There is a very good reason for this. Leaks, and the freedom to put their contents into the public domain, are an essential ingredient of our democracy. It is what helps the Press to keep in check corrupt or over-bearing politicians and public officials.Without the freedom to publish leaked information, for example, we would never have known the extent to which MPs and Lords were abusing their expenses regime.That required a newspaper to publish information gleaned from a computer disk which had been stolen — but thankfully in that case the Met decided that the public interest over-rode a possible offence of handling stolen goods.Without the Panama Papers we would never have known the extent to which wealthy iniduals and corporations have gone into keeping their wealth out of the taxman’s grasp. Without the “climategate” leaks we would not have known how some climate scientists were prepared to manipulate past temperature records to support their theories.It took a leak, too, to establish that the Blair government knew it was unlikely that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but that George W Bush had resolved to overthrow Saddam regardless.Then there was “Plebgate”, when a leaked police log revealed a bust-up between government chief whip Andrew Mitchell and police manning the gates at Downing Street — and led an officer to be jailed when it was revealed he had invented his witness statement.There are, of course, plenty of other countries in the world where journalists would be locked up for publishing information that has leaked from the government, but they are not countries in which most of us would want to live.By over-reacting to what is an embarrassment to the Foreign Office, the Met has taken a leaf out of the book of President Erdogan of Turkey, who has locked up dozens of journalists as he attempts to suppress all opposition to his regime.Neil Basu and other senior Met Police officers should back off and accept that the Press is quite within its rights to publish leaked information that does not threaten national security.We are, after all, one of the world’s oldest ing democracies — not a tinpot state where people get led off in chains for daring to reveal the truth. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Unlike the cells in the womb that leave the body as a period, this blood has no way to escape.That can lead to infertility, fatigue, bowel and bladder problems, as well as really heavy, painful periods.It affects one in ten women in the UK.Symptoms include:The cause of endometriosis is unknown and there is no definite cure.According to Endometriosis UK, it takes over seven years on average for women to finally receive a diagnosis.Its estimated that up to  per cent of infertile women has the condition.Source: Endometriosis UKThe immune cells help the lesions grow and also drive the development of their blood supply.More recent research has also revealed that macrophages help nerves grow in the lesions.The aim of the new study, published in a recent Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal paper, was to determine the mechanistic role of macrophages in producing pain associated with endometriosis.Senior study author Dr Erin Greaves, who holds positions at both universities, explained that conventional treatments that use hormones are not ideal because they target oianand can trigger side effects, such as suppressing fertility.She added: We are trying to find non-hormonal solutions.The team found that disease-modied macrophages stimulate nerve cell growth and activity by releasing the growth hormone insulin-like growth factor- .They also found that levels of IGF- in pelvic cavity tissue from women with endometriosis were higher than in women without the condition and were in line with their pain scores.Further tests revealed that preventing the hormones activity by blocking the cell receptor for IGF-, reverses the pain behaviour observed in mice with endometriosis.Dr Greaves added: If we can learn about the role of macrophages in endometriosis then we can distinguish them from healthy macrophages and target treatment to them."},{"url":null,"title":"festival pranksters push portable loo","story":"The group of topless lads

to underpin the estimated business costs”.The announcement is one of a raft that Cabinet ministers wanted to push out before the new PM takes over next week.The Business Department is also pushing out a series of new initiatives on workers rights that Business Secretary Greg Clark thinks Boris Johnson may try to halt.One government source told The Sun: “It’s interesting to see Hancock trying to get a new sin ban under the wire before his boss Boris arrives”.But a source close to Mr Hancock said: “There is a debate about applying sin taxes to products consumed by adults, but preventing children from consuming harmful products should be a lot more straight forward”.In his controversial assault on sin taxes announced two weeks ago, Mr Johnson singled out another of Mr Hancock’s proposals for

was initially announced by Mr Johnson’s rival for No Jeremy Hunt, when he was health secretary.The energy drinks age limit was due to appear in outgoing PM Theresa May’s Prevention Green Paper to

His English was fairly limited and my Spanish went no further than: “Paella, mucho gracias.”So when, after several minutes of discussing the musical inspiration for his new single album , I went in for the killer question.“How many women have you slept with ”He shrugged.“ ” I ventured.He pulled an expression to suggest I had woefully misjudged his pulling power with the opposite sex. So I aimed higher.“, ”“Ooo knows ” he drawled with a lazy smile. “A gentleman  . . .  he never tell.”“Shall we go with , then ” I suggested, aswe were making a joint entry to one of those “guess how many sweets” attractions at the local fete. He shrugged again, a gesture I took as implicit confirmation. Well, he didn’t deny it.The interview appeared the following day and shortly afterwards the figure went global when the US-based National Enquirer ran with it.Julio, who is charm personied, made no complaint when his legendary Lothario-ism went stratospheric, though many years later he mitigated to another interviewer who broached the subject: “Me, I don’t have numbers. I respect women very much.”Like Mick Jagger, who is said to have bedded around , women, the Spanish crooner joined the ranks of Warren Beatty, Errol Flynn, Jack Nicholson and the notorious lover Casanova as one of history’s great seducers.Back then, such, ahem, swordsmanship was admired.

The battle now is to shut them up againShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsopinion\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhataposs worse - racism that doesnapost care what you think, or racism that cannot admit what it is Unapologetic, swaggering, chest-beating hate is hard to deal with, because it thrives on being disliked. Someone who denies what they appear to be, who professes to be one of the good guys working for a better world in which there just happens to be fewer of one sort of person, is harder still, because they simply refuse to be diagnosed.  Weaposre living in a world where absolutely everyone is racist. Donald Trump is a white racist. He says his critics are black racists. Jeremy Corbyn is called an anti-Semite. His supporters say Jews are Islamophobes. The comfortable, globe-spanning civilisation we lived in about  years ago has become a place filled with tribes who tell everyone  theyaposre in the wrong tribe.Thing is, the rest of the world has always been like that. Where the white enslaved the black, where those left behind warred with neighbours, where the Chinese now fight for control with Russians, where Nigerians or Australians or Venezuelans or Hutus or Tutsis are blamed for the remainder of problems. Itaposs just that now, everyone on the planet has the same madness. The Westaposs problem is not racism. It is that its tribe has shrunk - the us is no longer NATO, the United Nations, Europe, or the special relationship. Every tie that bound us into a larger group has been severed in a funding row of some sort, and the only tribes we have left are the ones we were born into.So a Jew who found a home in the Labour Party is now just a Jew. A Muslim whose values chimed with the Tories is now talking at mosque, not the constituency association. And a white Briton, like a white American, is ing to the past.Everyoneaposs going back to where they came from, and hates it.  Racism won when Donald Trump was elected leader of the Free World, that loose tribe we used to be members of. A man who said Mexicans were all rapists, who refused to let apartments to blacks  years ago, shouted at us until we were numbed. Like a patient whoaposs had too much electro-shock therapy, weaposre dazedly asking ourselves whether racism is really that racist.Because Trump says it, the same question is asked on radio phone-ins, on TV talk shows, in newspaper columns, pubs, workplaces, family dinners. The rest of the world is awful, says a tribe that doesnapost notice its own failings. Why donapost the awful people fix their awfulness  Thataposs pretty awful too, butyouaposre offended at that theyaposll be offended right back. For once, there really ARE good people on both sides, taking offence at the suggestion their tribe is less than perfect and the other might just be right.And now all of them are asking, out loud, what your ethnicity is, and comparing it to their own.   If tribalism was a good idea, weaposd all be happier right now. Africa would have been the most cheerful place on the planet for centuries, and the Labour Party would be thriving on its splits.But tribes make us smaller. Smaller in the head, in ambition, in influence and in power. A single building block cannot build a damned thing, and reducing ourselves to a unit of our birth is like evolution in reverse.We are at the edge of the swamp, looking at a place filled with things that slither and crawl, where there are no alliances and lots of death. A place where four legal citizens of a nation are called disloyal for wanting it to be a better place, where there are more guns than there are people, and where nutjobs call themselves a well-regulated militia able to gun down any target they choose.They forget that those who were dferent were the ones who survived the swamp. They grew fins and gills, then legs and lungs, and decided to live somewhere better.   If you are asked your ethnicity, there is only one answer. We are all % African. Thereaposs not a human on the planet who is indigenous aside from those who live in the Great Rt Valley of East Africa, and thereaposs no room for us all to go back there. Yet we introduce domestic abuse legislation that does not apply to migrants, and we free victims of human trafficking and send them right back to the places where they were enslaved. Trump is not responsible for the tribalism which has infected our race. Heaposs just ridden a wave which started in the  financial crisis, a wave similar to the one which started in the Great Depression and brought us the Nazis.But his praise of Nazis, his uttering of Nazi tropes, his constant ision of humans into smaller units, has enabled the same things to be discussed and done where in the world. Get rid of him, and America will have enabled the rest of the world to straighten its tie and tell the Nazis to shut up. Trumpaposs tribalism is useful. It will, one day soon, cause the USA to question its founding principles, reinvent its dream, correct the religious fundamentalism, slavery and narrow-mindedness with which it has been cursed for  years, and rebuild. That cannot, and will not, happen without Trump to kick against - evolution requires an existential threat.    When America unites, others will follow. Perhaps because tribalism just had its day, and perhaps because of coincidental global economic growth. But itaposs a matter of when, not , because innovation and improvement is inevitable in everything, except minds of hardliners in ISIS and the Republican Party.Death will come to Trump, one day, and maybe even the taxman. The voters will probably take him first, along with the financial realities of trade wars. If you ide your enemies, all you get is more enemies. Brexit is a dead end. Corbyn has nothing to do but fail. Putin, Duterte, Salvini, all aposstrong menapos rely upon tribes that do not question them, because they cannot withstand a question.When this tribalism dies - and it will - you must make sure to kill it everywhere. It lived on in Africa, Asia and the Pacic Rim because you left them behind, last time. Progressive is not an insult. Itaposs the only way forward, and everyone needs to move. We are not racist. We are the human race, a team of billions who all want to live somewhere better.

When we met a few weeks ago, I asked you to ban imports of hunting trophies. You declined.You claimed trophy hunting could be good for conservation. This is the absurd argument peddled by the trophy hunting industry.They will doubtless now lobby you furiously following your article.Don’t listen to their lies. Trophy hunters are not conservationists.They are people who kill animals for fun. They then make up excuses to try and justy their so-called ‘sport’. If trophy hunting was good for conservation, why have lion populations fallen from , in the s to just , today  Why have elephant numbers fallen from over  million in the s to just , today  Why are rhinos, cheetahs, leopards, hippos and giraffes ALL in serious trouble     Trophy hunters kill huge numbers of endangered animals every year, and – incredibly - this government lets them. You have to get an import permit from the government before going off to Africa to shoot one of them. Britain lets its trophy hunters shoot cheetahs. Even the Trump administration doesn’t allow that. We’re one of the worst countries in the world for hunting elephants. We’re also one of the worst when it comes to ‘canned lion hunting’. This is the disgusting practice of breeding lions in factory farms so that cowards can shoot them in enclosures. British values are all about fairness. There is NOTHING fair about shooting a tame lion in a cage. But don’t just ban canned lion trophies. We need to ban ALL wildle trophies. British hunters are shooting hippos, leopards, zebras, bears, baboons, and even monkeys. And the number of animals shot is climbing. What sort of legacy are we leaving our children     Britain is a signatory to CITES, the international law that prohibits trade in endangered wildle. But CITES says its rules don’t apply to trophy hunting. Why  Because apparently trophy hunting is not a ‘commercial’ industry. How is an industry worth  million not commercial  Trophy hunters can pay up to £, for their sick expeditions! You have rightly condemned poaching. We need to condemn trophy hunting too.When you poach a rhino, you kill it and take its body parts. When you trophy hunt a rhino, you do the same.The poacher sells the horn to make money. The trophy hunter sticks the rhino head over his fireplace.   It doesn’t matter what we label the killer. The fact is the rhino is dead. Michael, you worked hard to bring in the Ivory Bill. You introduced tougher sentences for animal cruelty. You have a chance right now to leave a lasting legacy.

Remember the days when hardly anyone ever talked about Europe, when politics was about jobs, the NHS, social care, housing, transport and schools  Well, those days are gone, for now at least. A recent survey found that half the population identies with a religion and just under two-thirds feels attachment to a political party, yet % identy as a Remainer or Leaver - that’s % more than voted in the referendum.    The story of the last three years is the story of how a fringe issue has become the principal social ision of our times.

I just think itaposs really unhygienic. You donapost expect that to be anywhere near your food let alone on the side of your drink. Itaposs just not nice. Theyaposre quite small maggots. Thereaposs definitely one on the inside of the rim and thereaposs one on the outside too which you can see moving and crawling around. I was with work colleagues and we had stopped there for a break. They thought it was absolutely disgusting. They thought it was terrible. We were all of the same opinion. Leon has theorised that the maggots dropped down from the drinks dispenser when his drink was being prepared. He claims he pointed out the maggots to the manager and was offered a fresh drink, but instead asked for a refund. Although the manager did refund the £. he had spent on his meal just eight minutes after he had ordered it, Leon claims he was offered no apology for the bugs. Leon said: I took it straight back and the manager askedI wanted another drink and I said, aposI donapost want another drink, I want a refundapos. He said, aposI will do it again for youapos, and I said, aposplease just give me a refundapos.  I got a refund in the end and I think the whole thing, from getting the meal to the refund, was about eight to  minutes. He didnapost actually apologise. McDonaldaposs have not responded at all. The drinks come out of a dispenser so the maggots are obviously inside the dispenser and dropping down on the cups, lids and whatnot. Thataposs the worrying thing. Thataposs the only logical explanation I think of. They must be inside the dispenser machine. Itaposs not good. I didnapost want to eat anything  there.

However, she told Yahooaposs Royal Box podcast that some are fed up with the monarchyaposs silence in response to stories about the Duchess of Sussex.    She said : Overall, Americans - I’m generalising a little bit - but they love the royal family. The love affair truly started with Diana. With Meghan in there they’re very proud - it’s one of their own behind palace walls. There is a sense, however, they feel that the Royal Family hasn’t done enough to protect Meghan. And that is a theme that is developing.    She continued: They find it hard to understand the Royal Family’s philosophy of ‘we don’t say anything because all that does is perpetuate the story’. There’s a sense there that she’s been under attack and that someone should have stood up and defended her. But the thing is - let’s say Prince Charles did come out and say something.

She said: “My bum was so flat before and everyone on social media was trolling me. “The trolls told me to stop getting boob jobs and spend money on my bum instead - well now that I have, they will just find something  to troll me for. “I don’t care what the trolls say anyway, because I’m on my journey with my passion for plastic perfection and no one is going to stop me.”  The surgery addict has previously had three boob jobs and splurged more than £, on beauty treatments.

And the dig at the company - which has holiday parks in Wiltshire, Cumbria, Nottinghamshire and further afield, including a new one opening in Ireland at the end of the month - seems to have struck a chord with parents, who say the price hike is aposunfairapos and aposbloody disgracefulapos. More than , people have shared the post in the last two days alone and itaposs received more than , comments, reports Manchester Evening News.    Among those to comment was Kay Lunnon, who said: Why can’t they just have it the same price all year round so it is more affordable for someone in the peak season too  I get that they have more staff to pay and more activities but surely it’s still the same number of accommodation that they rent out so why should it be double the price  It’s not fair as parents want to be able to take their children away but the prices are too extreme for some families. If they made it the same price all year round so that the off peak was slightly higher than it is now and peak is slightly less then it’s fair for everyone.  Sandra Phillips said: Just an absolute rip off, there is no justication for doing this, just pure greed, this should be tackled, terribly unfair for people who actually can’t take their kids out of school. Others called for greater regulation of holiday companies to prevent such price hikes, like Jayne Foxwell, who said: You may complain about the school holiday prices being extortionate but actually,government had better regulation of the holiday companies we may see a fairer system. Iaposve worked for a holiday company and now work in a school so Iaposve seen both sides of this coin. By the way, schools do not fine, the council processes them, so in turn this means the government. The very ones who are not making things fairer for families.  And some were eager to stress the number of teachers and school staff, who also struggle to afford holidays at peak times. Averil Hudson said: I think itaposs so unfair. And also for the teachers and their families, not like they can take time off either. I wish something could be done about this, like a cap put on it or something. The Manchester Evening News did its own search of the Center Parcs website to compare the prices of breaks at the nearest site in Whinfell Forest. It showed a similar price hike - costing £, for a four-night midweek break in August, compared with £ for the same accommodation in September.

I had to rush from work, staff were really upset and did not have a clue what was going on.    Our son has additional needs and requires nursery as a regular support.

In a letter sent to parents, nursery owner Jackie Davies said poor practice and safety and wellbeing of the children sparked the Ofsted inspection. The letter reads: Some of you might have already heard but I have to make the dficult decision to temporarily close the nursery with immediate effect today. While investigating an issue at nursery along with an Ofsted officer, poor practice was identied from a large proportion of the staff and senior staff had failed to act accordingly. This brings into question the safety and wellbeing of the children as all policies and procedures are overseen by the Senior Management who also happen to be the designated safeguarding leads.

Experts predicted that % will appear to be red or dark grey thanks to a partial lunar eclipse, which is visible from the UK. The rare eclipse will reach its height at around .pm, the Royal Astronomical Societysaid. The stunning show will last more than five hours, ending at around .am, when the moon moves away from the Earthaposs lighter shadow. The redness will be caused by sunlight passing through the planetaposs atmosphere.    It happens when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon - which causes a large shadow to form. The eclipse comes  years to the day after the Apollo  mission blasted off from Florida. Four days later Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon. Clear skies are expected, meaning the eclipse should be visible across most of the country. Experts say it is safe to observe the lunar eclipse with the naked eye.    Stronger atmospheric scattering of blue light means that the light that reaches the lunar surface is predominantly red in colour. So for observers on Earth, the eclipsed part of the Moon may be brick-coloured, rusty, blood red, or sometimes dark grey, depending on terrestrial conditions. For this reason, the lunar eclipse is often described as a Blood Moon - or in the case of a partial lunar eclipse, a Half-Blood Moon. A post on astronomy website Space-India says: “The best part is you need no equipment to observe it, just look up at our beloved Luna.

Rain will lash parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales early this afternoon, before spreading across almost the entire country by the evening, the Met Office says. The mercury will drop slightly tomorrow, with highs of C, and showers in Scotland are expected to turn thundery.    However, there will also be sunshine in central and south Wales and south and south-west England, with sunny spells across other parts of the country.

As the rain moves through, winds will become quite blustery for a time, helping to knock the edge off of any early warmth.    The cloud and showery rain will take its time to clear the south-east on Thursday. The showers will become more widespread during the day though, especially in the north and west, with some heavy, thundery downpours likely.

The horried commuter then the footage on to Reddit and wrote: They really need to vacuum these train seats.    Web users were left disgusted by the horrible conditions of the seats used by thousands of passengers daily. One user wrote: Do the same thing to the bus seats and youaposll see it too. Not just limited to the trains, but buses too. Some joked as they suggested commuters to  aposenjoy the tuberculosisapos or aposenjoy your chest infectionapos. Transport authority NSW Trainlink responded said regularly cleans the trains but dirt will occur due to the number of people who use public transport.    A spokesman said: NSW Trainlink has a rigorous cleaning program where our trains are cleaned on a daily basis. We also have staff across the network who clean our trains throughout the day as well as frequent deep cleaning of our seats each week. With an average of more than . million intercity services each month, there are instances where common dirt and grime do occur on our trains.

Hopefully, we can win the game and go on.“Qualication is in our hands so we can just focus on ourselves and, hopefully, win the rest of the games,we can, and see where it takes us.“We are concentrating on the rest of the cup games and getting ourselves ready for a dficult league season, too.“We do, though, have a good team, a strong team and a real togetherness through the players and coaching staff and that includes the players we’ve brought in.“The fans, too, showed us great support on Friday and they stayed around after the game and we really appreciate that.“It’s going to be a tough season but we’re all confident we can do well.”Connolly felt there was lots to take out of the performance at a rain-sodden Tynecastle but insists there’s plenty more to come from United.He told the Tele: “We came back late because of the play-offs so that was our first full  minutes for a lot of us.“We take a lot of positives out of Friday and there is a plenty of stuff we can work on.“Obviously, away to Tynecastle is a hard place. They had a strong team but I don’t think they had too many clear opportunities and, with Nicky Clark’s chance near the end, we could have ended up winning the game.“It was a tough night but it was good to play a team in the league above us and we showed we can handle ourselves against the bigger teams.“We did ourselves proud – disappointed we could only draw but there are positives to take into tonight’s game and, hopefully, go again.“Hearts’ two front players – Conor Washington is an international and Uche Ikpeazu I played against down south – both are tough to play against.“They are good players but I think the whole back four handled them well and so did the boys in front of us. We showed character at times when we needed to. We rolled our sleeves up and put our bodies on the line.”He added: “We were disappointed with the goal we lost. It was a sloppy one to concede but we’ll take the positives.“It was - at Hearts in the first competitive game of the season – we’re just disappointed we didn’t get more.”Connolly admits he’d rather avoid any more penalty shootouts after two defeats in their last two competitive contests following last season’s loss against St Mirren in the play-off.“Penalties are just not working for us right now!” joked Connolly.“We have improved since May but it’s just one of those things.

They will not have scouted Ojo once, they will have scouted him four or five times.“I know Derek has a plethora of people in England who are looking at players constantly. Hopefully Ojo will end up being a very good player for Aberdeen.”Only  months ago Championship Leeds United, Nottingham Forest and Queen’s Park Rangers were linked with potential moves for Ojo. With English second-tier clubs circling, Scunthorpe valued him at £,.He was rated as the best deep-lying midfielder in League One and was targeted for his vision, intelligent passing and composure in possession.Ojo was Aberdeen’s eighth signing of a busy summer transfer window by boss McInnes.Tosh, who played for the Dons from -, said: “The signings this summer have been strong and it is testament to Derek and Tonythat they are striving every year to be as good as they possibly can.“Derek lost some players at the end of last season and has brought in a good pedigree.“Hopefully they can fit in well and become an asset to the club.”While McInnes has been active in the transfer window Tosh insists retaining key players has been equally important.Towards the end of last season keeper Joe Lewis, recently named club captain, signed a five-year contract extension.Aberdeen have also rejected offers for defender Scott McKenna in recent windows, with a £. million bid from Aston Villa knocked back last summer.There still remains six weeks of the transfer window, however, and clubs could come in for Scotland international McKenna, who the Dons value at £m.“It is great to get new signings but also important to tie down players to new deals,” he said.“You have to do that when looking towards the future.“You look at certain players like Scott McKenna.“Not losing him is a big thing, although there is still a bit of the transfer window to go.“Boys like Scott Wright have come back and others are also a year older so you are looking for them to step up.“I am sure Derek will be excited about the season ahead.”Ojo is ineligible for tomorrow’s Europa League tie against RoPS in Finland as he signed after the UEFA deadline to register players for the first qualying round.He will be available to play in the next round, should Aberdeen see off RoPS in Lapland.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events. I know they were in touch with the community council earlier this year before the event, hopefully theyrsquoll keep up this close relationshipthey come back.Meanwhile, Allan Graham who has lived in the town all of his le said without events such as Transcend, the Innerleithen community has nothing.He added: ldquoThe mills have all gone and what we have is biking, walkers etc. Letrsquos embrace whatrsquos coming to us and make the most of it.Jamie Birks echoed this sentiment adding: ldquoThe town has a real and deserved opportunity to be a national hub for outdoor events such as this.

They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though.

However, he followed that bogey by birdieing the second, third and fourth holes to take him to two-under-par through four.Another birdie on the eighth took him out in  shots, three under par.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

If he or anyone  thinks that abandoning our EU membership will give the UK more control of its future when negotiating with the US or China then they have another think coming. We currently have a voice in Brussels, we will have none in Washington, Beijing or even Brussels for that matter.As for an independent Scotland taking its orders from Brussels rather than Westminster, well thats OK by me. From where I sit Brussels looks like a beacon of good governance, compared to the basket case which is the UK governed by an English parliamentat Westminster.John Jamieson, Ayr.THE dficulty of Alan Fitzpatrickrsquos letter is summed up in one sentence, ldquoWhy can they not come clean and admit that by the former what they are seeking is separation from the UK, and by the latter they mean the substitution of control from Brussels to that at present from Westminster Westminster and Brussels are by no means identical. Westminster is an all-encompassing political union which can legislate on any matter it chooses, but the European Union is a treaty-based economic union with powers limited and controlled by member states. These include product standards and composition, product labelling, rights of movement and residence of EU citizens, company law, banking regulation, consumer protection, animal welfare, farm payments and managing the fish stocks in member statesrsquo fishing grounds. This sounds like a lot , however its main purpose is to ensure trade can be carried out fairly, and that for instance, no country attempts to achieve success by limiting employee rights or producing goods and services to a lower standard than others. It does not, however, include such as education, welfare, defence or foreign policies.Mr Fitzpatrickrsquos claim that the EU is on a ldquomarch hellip toward an ever-closer union is hypothetical at best, requiring the future agreement of the member states. In contrast Westminsterrsquos powers, within the UK, are to all intents infiniteLastly, he raises the issue that ldquoin the UK Scotland doesnrsquot get the government that they themselves voted for, how is that going to change in the EU  and there is no doubt that there would be times when the balance of members we elect to the European Parliament will not be reflected in its final majority. That though is not the most important point.The fact that one member of the UK ndash England ndash constitutes almost  per cent of the population meansthat there is clarity there about their aims then, pretty much no matter what the other member states think, they will achieve their aims. This could be clearly seen in the EU referendum, when evenwe deduct the Leave vote in Walesand in Northern Irelandthere would still be a majority for Leave in the UK! To repeat,there is a dference of opinion between the member states of the UK, England is well large enough to get its own way eventhere is only a slight majority there. Even Germany lacks that power in the EU. The UK is anything but a Union of equals.Mr Fitzpatrick claims that by ldquotake back control independence supporters mean ldquothe substitution of control from Brussels to that at present from Westminster, when the reality is we seek control ing to Scotland while sharing our sovereignty with the EU on its agreed range of issues, securing access to one of the worldrsquos largest markets, which the UK is minded to sacrice.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.ALAN Fitzpatrick is missing the point re dressing up spades. If Scotland were independent, we could decide to apply to join the EU or not - our choice. Whatever was decided, it would be Scotlands decision, no need to go cap in hand to Westminster to seek permission.That is taking back control: our decisions made by us and us alone.John McCallum, Glasgow.ALAN Fitzpatrick contends that Scotland would not be independenta member of the European Union by that reasoning, Mr Fitzpatrick must also believe that Denmark, Portugal, Finland, Estonia, Ireland and all the other EU member countries are not independent nations. I would remind Mr Fitzpatrick that during negotiations with the UK, every EU country had the right of veto, and all of them stood solidly behind Ireland in its particular set of circumstances, while Scotlands overwhelming vote to remain within the EU was pointedly ignored by the UK government at Westminster.And though membership of the EU is of vital importance to Scotland, there are other benefits of being an independent nation on the world stage Monaco, with a population of , actively participates in the United Nations, and is a member of many international organisations, including the World Health Organisation, and Unesco.

Industry figures insist this represents a crucial opportunity for supply chain companies and technology developers to meet demand.There are more than , wells and around , tonnes of s due to be disposed of, reused or recycled over the next decade in the UK, at a cost of around poundbn.In the  Budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced a call for evidence on plans to make Scotland a global hub for decommissioning.The UK Government has argued Scotland will ldquopioneer the future of the global oil and gas industry, with the North Sea representing ldquoone of the first regions in the world to start decommissioning on such a large scale .This provides opportunities for innovation, while the challenging environment in the North Sea is also seen as an advantage in refining techniques.Earlier this year, a report by Westminsterrsquos Scottish Affairs Committee said: ldquoDecommissioning represents a signicant export opportunity for Scottish businesses.ldquoScotland has the opportunity to become a global base for the decommissioning industry.Mike Tholen, upstream policy director at Oil and Gas UK, said decommissioning is a growing market of which Britain is well-placed to take advantage.He said: ldquoThe Decommissioning Challenge Fund underlines the Scottish Governmentrsquos ongoing commitment to the oil and gas industry as we look to harness decommissioning opportunities at home and indeed, globally.ldquoAlthough decommissioning only accounts for  per cent of total spend in the North Sea, it is a growing market in which the UK has first-mover advantage.ldquoThis will not only provide the supply chain with a steady workflow in the UK, but these competitive capabilities are exportable to a global market.ldquoAt the same time, we remain focused on providing security of energy supply through home-produced resources, providing energy sovereignty as recognised recently by the Committee on Climate Change in its net zero report.ldquoAll of this will ensure that we continue to provide highly skilled jobs, remain a major economic contributor and are best placed to become a key partner in the transition towards a low carbon future.Some environmental campaigners have advocated a ldquorigs to reefs approach which would see oil and gas infrastructure left in place rather than removed at the end of its lespan.This would allow subsea structures to act as articial reefs, providing a refuge for a wide iety of marine le.A spokesman for the Scottish Wildle Trust said: ldquoDecommissioning of oil rigs, evencarried out sensitively, will cause some disturbance to the marine environment.ldquoThe alternative to removal is leaving the structure in place, which may seem like abandonment but there can actually be ecological benefits to leaving oil rigs in place because marine le tends to gather around large objects such asthe legs of oil rigs, using them asarticial reefs.ldquoImportantly, the decision on what

No mention of the dedicated preparatory efforts of Steve Baker, Chris Heaton-Harris, and their colleagues at the Brexit Department. No mention either of the very extensive work on the other side of Channel by Xavier Bertrandand his team in the Hauts-de-France region, with the French Governments local administration, to ensure the ports of Calais, Boulogne and Dunkirk, as well as Eurotunnel and airports, have  per cent fluidity on day one in the event of no-deal Brexit.

It is easier to believe a lie than search for the truth.Doug Clark, Currie.IN its own version of its own slogan, Project Fear, the SNP warns of the threat of drug shortages post-Brexit. If anyone on the pro-UK side of politics had issued an equivalent and shameful and fear-mongering warning, just imagine the faux nationalist outrage.Coincidentally, at the same time as their latest fear mongering, it is revealed that Scotland, under the SNP, is fast becoming the \"drugs deaths capitalrsquorsquo of the planet. Its spinners will be madly trying to find out how this human tragedy can somehow be blamed on Westminster.No doubt there are many reasons for the startling increase in these horric deaths but an SNP administration, fixated on breaking up the UK and citizens assemblies and anything that may aid its search for the Holy Grail ndash leaving little or no time for the day job ndash does not help.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.NEIL Mackay rightly rejects the idea of pursuing a route to independence outside of the law . Any route that smacks of pronouncing UDI is a bad look for a Government that wants to be taken seriously on the international stage.Yet Mr Mackayrsquos suggestion that the Scottish Government go to the Supreme Court or the European Court to try to overrule a UK Government refusal to grant a section  order for a second independence referendum is equally likely to end badly. He says ldquoitrsquos hard to see any court flouting the democratic will of the Scottish people, but that is surely the wishful thinking of an independence supporter.First, the court is likely to conclude that this matter is outside of its competence, with the decision to issue a section  order or not one that is fully the right of the UK Government. Secondly, any court will in any case be disinclined to get involved when, based on opinion polls, it is far from clear that there is majority support for having another referendum anytime soon. If such support were already overwhelming, then perhaps a court might be tempted, but instead, it is only the will of independence supporters that is being frustrated, not the will of the people of Scotland as a whole.Keith Howell, West Linton.LIKE Neil Mackay I am not a member of the SNP, but would like Scotland to be a self-governing country the international norm. Some points around his article, however.Plan B is not an original idea. It was first promulgated by Margaret Thatcher as the route to Scottish independence, and as such would be dficult for Unionists to argue was ldquobullying and illegal. All elections in Scotland for some years, driven by Unionists, have been fought only around independence and a referendum. The Supreme Court would certainly follow the English concept of constitutional law, and find Westminster sovereign. Its whythe Supreme Court was established: to override the Scottish constitutional view of ldquosovereignty of the people. Itrsquos time the Scottish media put pressure on Unionist politicians to give us their alternative to a second referendum, given many thought a second EU referendum was OK.GR Weir, Ochiltree.SO enthusiastic is Martin Redfernwith his obsession to denigrate First minister Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP, that he lets exaggeration of the rhetoric get in the way of the actualityndash even his frequent use of the conditional-tense phrase ldquoit would seem. . . does not get him off the hook.First, historically, it was Scotland being subjected to a Westminster government Conservative when it had voted otherwise Labour that was the main driver of the movement towards independence. Devolution, it was said, would kill nationalism stone dead ndash so what went wrong  Well, for a start, Tony Blair likened it to a parish council, so it can only be a stepping stone.But the flaws in Mr Redfernrsquos proposition are that it was not the nationalists that lost the  independence referendum, but the Yes campaign, which reflected non-nationalists too. And is he seriously suggesting that when a new first minister, or even a prime minister, is appointed as governing party leader, there should be a general election, which is the consequence of his assertion Douglas R Mayer, Currie.YOUR article about the impact of Boris Johnsons proposed reduction in rUK stamp duty on the willingness of people to remain in or move to Scotlandhighlights the problems the SNP has in adjusting taxes ndash especially income tax ndash while being joined at the hip with the UK.This is a situation that wont change with independence when, I assume, close economic ties and freedom of movement will be a main foundation of any SNP manesto and subsequent treaty.Far better to remain in the UK with harmonised fiscal policy and the equalising effect of the Barnet formula which compensates for regional iations, the benefits of which are obvious in the GERS reports which show Scotlands notional \"deficit\" is in effect an overdraft guaranteed by rUK which enables the Scottish Government to claim we balance our books every year.Allan Sutherland, Stonehaven."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-148th-open","story":"How old is The Open It was first played in  at Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire, which hosted the first  Opens.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amComedian and television personality, Alan Carr, is set to perform in Orkney, later this year.

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands.

The move is a result of a partnership with the organisation PAMISwhich campaigns for these facilities, and has been supported by Transport Scotland.The move comes as a result of research highlighting that , people in the UK need such special assistance and facilities. Users include people with profound and multiple learning disabilities and people with a range of other disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, Motor Neurone disease, Multiple Sclerosis, stroke, some older people and other specic disabilities.The requirements are set out in British Standards, and include:The new toilets are already open on deck six of MV Hjaltland and MV Hrossey, and will be available on board MV Hamnavoe by the end of the year.“This investment is another sign of our commitment to making our facilities as welcoming as possible to everyone in the community,# said Stuart Garrett, managing director at Serco NorthLink Ferries.#It will open up opportunities for many people with disabilities and their familes to visit some of the most beautul parts of Scotland. It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Number  called for Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe to be released immediately and said her family should be able to visit to check on her care.The Prime Ministerrsquos official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: ldquoWe are extremely concerned about Nazaninrsquos welfare and call for her immediate release, and we urge Iran to allow family members to visit her and check on her care.Before being transferred, Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe told relatives: ldquoI was healthy and happy when I came to Iran to see my parents.ldquoThree and a bit years later and I am admitted to a mental health clinic. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Richard Ratclfe, the husband of detained Nazanin Zaghari Ratclfe--ldquoLook at me now, I ended up in an asylum. It should be an embarrassment.ldquoPrison is getting harder and harder for me. I hate being played in the middle of a political game. I just hate it.In a press release, the Free Nazanin Campaign said it is not known what treatment she is receiving or how long she is expected to remain in hospital.The transfer comes after Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe went on hunger strike for  days last month in protest at her ldquounfair imprisonment. Mr Ratclfe also did not eat for the period in solidarity with his we as he camped on the pavement outside the Iranian Embassy in London.The couplersquos five-year-old daughter Gabriella has stayed in Iran with her grandparents since her motherrsquos arrest.Mr Ratclfe said: ldquoNazanin hoped that her hunger strike would move the Iranian authorities, and it clearly has.ldquoHopefully her transfer to hospital means that she is getting treatment and care, despite my distrust of just what pressures can happen behind closed doors. It is unnerving when we donrsquot know what is going on. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Ratclfe outside the Iranian Embassy in Knightsbridge--ldquoI am glad her dad has been down there to keep vigil outside.ldquoMental hospital has its worries at the best of times ndash but particularly when kept isolated and under the control of the Revolutionary Guard.ldquoEven now it still seems like games of power and control are being played by the Iranian authorities ndash even at the point of hospitalisation.ldquoWe hope again this is the beginning of the end. And yet, we were also here last summer. ldquoWe will be following up with the new prime minister whenever that is decided to ensure he takes personal responsibility for Nazaninrsquos case.At the end of the dual hunger strike, Mr Ratclfe said he believed the protest had been successful in raising the profile of his wersquos case, with more than  MPs coming to show support to him in person, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.Earlier this year, Foreign Secretary and Tory leadership hopeful Jeremy Hunt granted Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe diplomatic protection in a bid to resolve her case.In a  gaffe, Boris Johnson, Mr Huntrsquos rival for the post of become prime minister, said that Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe was in Iran ldquoteaching people journalism ndash despite her familyrsquos insistence she was there to visit relatives.He has repeatedly said the responsibility for her continued detention lies with the Revolutionary Guard.Ellie Kennedy, Amnesty International UKrsquos iniduals at risk campaigner, said: ldquoYet again, the fear must be that the Iranian authorities are playing games with Nazaninrsquos health and well-being.ldquoThe fact that this has been done without her familyrsquos involvement suggests the real motive may be more to do with exerting pressure on Britain, rather than providing Nazanin with treatment.ldquoWe know from other cases, that the Iranian prison authorities will sometimes use a range of pressuring techniques with prisoners, often designed to coerce  confessions or sometimes simply to punish them further.ldquoAnd sometimes using prisoners as pawns in political battles.ldquoAfter all she and her family have been through, the time really has come for the Tehran authorities to bring this to an end, to release her and let her travel back to the UK with her daughter Gabriella.copy -.

It is they, after all, who made history as ambassadors of humankind, setting foot onto a ­­\u2028far-flung celestial body. Michael Collins, Apollo ’s ­command module pilot, who watched on, fearful that catastrophe would intervene to ensure he would make theto Earth alone, played an integral part in the mission. So too did the many pioneers whose names occupy a mere footnote of history, despite the fact that without their expertise and composure, the disaster Collins feared – or much worse – would have almost inevitably come to pass. The semicentennial celebrations of the Moon landing is an occasion to remember those who occupy the foothills of the credits. One of the statistics surrounding Project Apollo, which seems to me both remarkable and entirely rational, is that around , people were involved in rendering the impossible possible.This army of engineers, scientists, programmers, mathematicians, and technicians defied technological limitations and bureaucratic wrangling to produce approximately five-and-a-half million parts which, working in unison, spirited Apollo’s crew to the Moon and back. : How moon landing conspiracy theories began and why they persist today – Professor Peter Knight:  years since the moon landing: why Scotland is the true home of astronaut Neil ArmstrongIn any other corporate environment, the prospect of workers on the ground feeling disconnected from the mission’s overall goal would barely warrant concern. But Project Apollo’s programme ­manager, George Müller, knew fine well the risks of letting such apathy go unchecked. He ensured the astronauts toured factories across America tasked with manufacturing the spacecraft components. This was no mere public relations exercise. It reminded workers that a single oversight on their part could kill the men standing before them, and it forged a sense of collective responsibility. Nowhere was this esprit de corps more evident than Building  of Nasa’s Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, home to the Apollo mission operations control centre , where the spacecraft’s ­navigation, propulsion, le support, and communications systems were monitored with unflinching ­scrutiny.At any given time, between  and  men – and one trailblazing woman, JoAnn Morgan, the instrumentation controller – held in their hands the lives of three men a ­quarter of a million miles away. Their number included Stephen Bales, the son of a janitor and a ­beautician, who less than five years previously had moved from the farming community of Fremont, Iowa, to join Nasa as an intern, responsible for guided tours. In an interview with  Minutes to the Moon, a superb BBC World Service podcast detailing the graft, ingenuity, and composure which underpinned the final descent to the lunar surface, Bales recently reflected on the mission that would define his career. Without him, it would have probably ended in failure. As the Eagle craft neared the Moon, an alarm code known as  flashed on its on-board computer display. It was the only moment in the entire mission when a degree of urgency,not fear, could be heard in Armstrong’s voice.Bales, by then one of Apollo ’s guidance officers, saw the alarm four seconds later. Initially unsure of its signicance, he remembered the last simulation he and the flight controllers had carried out before the landing proper. Back then a similar code, known as , had appeared, prompting Bales to call an abort. In the subsequent debriefing, he immersed himself in the myriad alarms that could be triggered, working with Jack Garman, a computer specialist, to understand their meaning.In doing so, they realised a  referred to a software reboot which cancelled all the processes that the computer was running crucially, it happened so fast, no vital guidance or navigation data would be lost. So when the code appeared for real, Bales knew the mission could continue. It was a decision made in the space of  seconds – “an eternity,” said Bales – but it saved Apollo . There are countless other stories like his. Take that of John Aaron from Oklahoma, the son of a cattle rancher and a minister, recruited by Nasa at  without an interview. He felt ashe had walked into a foreign country where people spoke another language, on account of the dizzying number of acronyms being hurled around. After just six weeks, he contemplated jacking it all in. Fortunately for him, and the Apollo programme, he knuckled down. Only a few months later, his split-second decision making was credited with saving Apollo  after its rocket was struck by lightning. It is dficult to conceive of the pressure these men worked under, as they analysed the spaceflight while listening to three,not four conversations simultaneously on communication channels known as ‘loops’.The average age of those inside MOCR was just , and as Gerry Grfin, the flight director during Apollo ’s fraught re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere, has pointed out, their youth counted in their favour. “It was the lack of fear,” he explained. “It wasn’t the lack of knowing it was risky.”It also means that, half a century on, many of them are still with us, able to reflect on an epoch-defining moment and receive our thanks for the part they played in it.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"can you help theatre make the world a better place linda crooks","story":"Next month, Scotland will be at the epicentre of the global arts and culture movement as the Edinburgh International Festival and Fringe blossom into le once again.The Traverse Theatre is at the heart of this cultural celebration – both physically and figuratively – and we welcome the heightened exposure and attention these festivals bring to the work of our theatre and many others in the capital.

To maximise the scope of those conversations we must ensure the Traverse continues to be accessible, attractive and welcoming to the many, not just the few.If we are to achieve that, we need to react to the many changes in the world around us and open up new pathways for people to come to the theatre, both as writers and as audience members.To that end, today we launch the search for two people who will be instrumental in shaping the work of the Traverse through to its th anniversary in  and beyond. After a period of consultation and reflection we are bolstering our leadership team by recruiting for a new artistic director of the Traverse Theatre Company, and a director of creative development. This investment will ensure we give equal energy to creating a vibrant programme of work that celebrates new material and developing routes into the theatre for new writers and audiences.The director of creative development will devote time and effort to strengthening those pathways by nurturing our relationships with communities here in Scotland and further afield. We believe creativity is an attribute everyone has and that everyone should be given the opportunity to explore their artistic talents. In creating a new role which has ultimate responsibility for that work, we will in turn enable and empower the incoming artistic director to focus exclusively on overseeing a new writing programme that represents an ambitious artistic vision for the Traverse.The people we appoint to these two roles will be joining a talented and determined team that has been instrumental in shaping this new structure and is eagerly awaiting this next phase in our growth. We believe these changes will not only help us deliver our vision, but meet our ambition to change the world we live in through the work we produce and the creative development programmes we champion. The Traverse exists to amply unfamiliar voices and to reach fresh eyes and ears with the work we produce all year round. If you feel as passionately about that as we do, we would love to hear from you.Linda Crooks is the Traverse’s executive producer.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"national trust for scotland accused of supplier payment delays","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The National Trust for Scotlandhas major issues at their finance department, with many suppliers not being paid for months, it has emerged.One supplier said he is now considering employing a debt collection agency to get payment for the thousands of pounds he is owed by the conservation charity, claiming he has been waiting months for the money owed.The NTS has cited problems with their new computer systems for the delays. However, firms waiting to be paid said the trust had also blamed computer glitches last year when problems arose.One supplier, who does not want to be named, said: “We’re chasing money at the moment. It’s a high four-figure sum. We’re only one of very many suppliers in the same position.“It’s slightly unbelievable that the trust is behaving like this. They assured us last year that all their IT problems had been fixed.“It’s not that they don’t have the money. Visitor attractions like Glenfinnan, Glencoe and Culloden are raking in enormous takings.“My underlying worry is that something’s wrong. We will keep chasing for the money, we need to claw that money back from them.”Another supplier, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said good will towards the charity among suppliers was drying up.“I’ve been waiting months for my money and getting nowhere when I email or phone,” the supplier said. “I can only deliver within a certain radius, so they are a great market for me. But at the same time, they sell our goods at greatly marked-up prices in their shops and we don’t see the benefit of it, which is galling right now.”Last September the trust was forced to temporarily suspend its members’ subscription direct debit payments during its IT system upgrade after a small number of members had the wrong amount being deducted or being actioned on the wrong day.In November, a number of membership direct debits were taken from bank accounts two days early. The trust said this was due to “human error” and not the new IT system.Simon Skinner, chief executive of the trust, which has about , members, said: “In stages over the past year, the trust has been introducing new IT systems designed to modernise its financial and customer services processes.“As with every major project of this type, there have been teething problems. “Unfortunately these problems have taken longer to resolve than anticipated due to a proprietary software bug. We have been working with the software provider to fix this issue and it is now resolved.“In the interim, we attempted to noty all suppliers of the issues. We also offered assurances that we had manual systems in place to ensure that they continued to receive payments, but there were inevitable delays, in part due to ensuring the validity of invoices. We are now working hard to ensure all monies outstanding are paid as soon as possible.”Mr Skinner added: “The trust is in good financial health, continues to be a going concern and is committed to making all outstanding payments quickly.“Should any supplier be experiencing serious dficulty due to the delays, we urge them to contact us as soon as possible. We regret any upset or concern caused.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example.

Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells.

We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations. The company had plans to sustainably grow their fish production levels over the next few years by #expanding into new high-energy farming areas located further offshore#.Bill Whyte, convener of the Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board, said he welcomed Mowi#s recognition of the wild salmonid habitats and added: #We will expect further clarity about the process of biomass relocation. However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

Herbinson was killed while out on duty in no-mans land. He states:He was a most excellent soldier and a very good NCO and the regiment will miss him very much. He had done very fine work when the battalion went into action on st July and I have heard from his officers how nobly he did his duty that day. He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless. I was present at the funeral and he has been laid in a British cemetery just behind the firing line so there will be no dficulty in locating the grave after the war.

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”“He suggested that the portraits of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh should be replaced with photographs of, at best, the Queen meeting people during engagements in Northern Ireland,\" said Lord Maginnis.“One such photograph features Her Majesty the Queen shaking hands with the former deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast.“I do not mind that what I mind is that the case brought by the complainant was settled secretly and that the sum of £, was handed over, presumably for hurt feelings and distress.“This settlement was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens.“I have been told to look at the annual accounts to find out where the money came from – but it is not to be found. That should concern us.”After some time had passed after the issue of compensation was settled, Lord Maginnis said that last year Mr Hegarty was promoted to become accounting officer of the Parades Commission.He said this contrasted with what he described as the years of delay in compensating victims of historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland. He said they had been “shamefully left out in the cold when it comes to their justiable claims for compensation”.“This is scandalous. It is an indictment of the Northern Ireland Office and of this government,\" he said.“We have lost all sense of reality when a portrait of Her Majesty can cause offence to a civil servant but we do not bat an eyelid when we deny closure and justice to unfortunate people who have been abused in the most outrageous manner imaginable.“I urge the Northern Ireland Office not only to restore the original portraits of Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh but to expedite payment of the comparatively paltry compensation due to the people who are more deserving than this opportunistic civil servant who, surely, must now be compromised in his position in the Parades Commission because of his bigoted stance over the Royal Family.”The Northern Ireland Office said in a statement: “We will not comment on inidual personnel matters.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland set to oppose eu daylight saving time plans","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"private jet numbers soar at derry airport for the open","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":null,"title":"operation motorman findings seamus bradley inquest made public next month","story":"The Inquest findings into one of the most controversial killings of the Troubles in Derry will be made public next month, the Derry News can reveal.Seamus Bradley was shot dead in highly disputed circumstances by the British Army during Operation Motorman in the early hours of July , .The Coroners Service for Northern Ireland has now confirmed that the findings of the Inquest will be announced by Judge Patrick Kinney on August  at Laganside Court in Belfast.

That decision was however overturned after a Divisional Court ruling last year.Previous decisions not to prosecute in the Hegarty case were taken in  after the original Inquest and again in  following a review of the case by the former Historical Enquiries Team.Announcing the decision in relation to the Hegarty case, Director of the PPS Stephen Herron said: “I have given careful consideration to all of the available evidence.

Durkan come after the latest public consultation attracted over  objections which he now believes will scupper plans for similar schemes in areas such as Rosemount and Bishop Street.Mr Durkan said the Department for Infrastructurehas been “extremely ham-fisted” in its handling of the consultation process.The parking scheme issue stretches back around ten years, with ious public consultations having taken place in that time. At one stage, it was expected to be introduced in  but had to be pushed back until .In  then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy gave assurances that, “in the absence of signicant objections”, the scheme would be in place no later than Spring .However, this week, after a consultation ended last April and a further information session was held in November, a spokesperson for the Department explained that the proposed Rossville Street Residents’ parking scheme received a large number of objections from the residents.Of the  responses received, there were  objections to the scheme.The DfI told the Derry News that key areas of concern coming out of the consultation included the number of permits allocated for visitors, access for family carers and concerns over costs.The Department has since confirmed that the resident and visitor permits would be free and that a special permit would be available for family carers, also free of charge.The DfI spokesperson added: “The Department acknowledges that there is still a need to manage car parking in the Bogside and is now considering how to progress matters.“Consideration is being given to advancing a smaller scheme within the Rossville area to include Abbey Park, Glenfada Park and Columbcille Court, possibly as a pilot. The Department would hope to commence consultation for a smaller scheme in September.“The Department will write out to all residents living within the limits of the original Rossville scheme as soon it is confirmed how an alternative scheme will be progressed.“The Department is not in a position to consider other schemes at this time.”StaggeringMark H. Durkan is worried that delays to the Bogside parking scheme will now hamper the roll-out of similar schemes.“The fact this is happening will now block progress on any residents’ parking scheme where in the city.“Bogside residents want a parking scheme so it must be the design of it that people are objecting to. It’s staggering that a much-needed parking scheme in an area where residents struggle and have been crying out for a solution to the problem of getting parked outside their homes during the day has been scrapped.“This scheme has been deliberated over for ten years and the department has brought proposals forward that have been met with such opposition. It begs the question, was enough done to liaise and interact with objectors, and could they respond in turn to these objections.“Bogside was identied as a key area, as was Bishop Street and the next was the lower Rosemount university area. But now it seems asthe department has pulled the plug on those schemes and there is no chance of progress.”Parallel schemesThe SDLP representative had enquired about the possibility of a similar scheme in other areas which are badly impacted by students such as Rosemount, and Abercorn Place and Terrace which are both affected by city centre workers.“These could have been done in parallel so that at least one scheme could be advanced. People in Rosemount are frustrated that they’ve been put on the back burner while this other scheme was being progressed, but they’ll be even more frustrated to see it isn’t being progressed.“Rosemount and Bishop Street will now be way down the line, the handling of this by the Department of Infrastructure seems extremely ham-fisted,” Mr Durkan added.The Rossville Street area Residents’ Parking Scheme would be the first such scheme for the City and involves over  residential properties mainly in the Rossville Street, Fahan Street, Little Diamond, Creggan Street and Chamberlain Street areas.A DfI publication in March stated that, proposals for the Scheme were first announced by the previous Minister for Infrastucture, and following informal consultations “there has proven to be signicant support from residents who are experiencing increasing dficulties parking outside their homes.”The Department wrote to all residents within the area and encouraged all interested parties to formally respond to the proposals before  April.If introduced as proposed, the scheme would have designated free of charge parking places for residents only between the hours of . am and noon and between . pm and . pm from Monday to Saturday inclusive.Visitors would have been able to park within areas designated for residents provided a valid visitor’s permit is displayed on the vehicle.

There needs to be swt action as an enhanced facility could alleviate the problem people are currently facing.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said the current Driver and Vehicle test centre network was built around  years ago.ldquoMuch has been done to maintain and modernise the test centres in that time, particularly to meet the growing demand for vehicle tests. However, present and future legislative requirements, coupled with increasing and changing demands for testing services, mean that the current network is no longer sustainable, he said.ldquoAs such, we have been reviewing the network with a view to determining the most appropriate network of test centres to meet our future needs.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we

problems within the districtrsquos planning department have been laid bare in a Newry, Mourne and Down Council report which has been made public.The local authority mdash which is responsible for district planners mdash has revealed in its annual audit committee report that the current number of live planning applications in the system is just over ,.The confirmation comes after local politicians recently pointed to what they described as ldquoserious problems at council management level for not taking the planning backlog seriously enough.Politicians have expressed concern that planners are not responding to their telephone calls and emails, with people who lodge applications also concerned that they are not getting any information from officials.Elected representatives say while all the fault does not rest with planners, they are firmly of the view that there are simply not enough staff to deal with the huge volume of work.Concern has also been expressed that the planning department is having problems retaining staff to work in a department that receives the second highest number of applications across the Provincersquos  councils.Politicians say there is a need to ensure the planning department is running properly which the council explains in the new report is exactly what it aims to do.A major review of planning has already been undertaken and amendments made to the so-called scheme of delegation which is a set of rules which determines whether a planning application will be decided by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee or planning officers.A critical look has also been taken at staffing structures in tandem with the arearsquos chief planner, with council officials conceding that while there are issues with staff turnover, positions are filled as quickly as possible.In addition, the council has admitted there is a communication issue within the planning department with the change that needs to happen something that cannot be achieved overnight.Signicantly, the new council report warns that failure to deliver timely planning decisions is a ldquorisk within the corporate risk register, with the number of live planning applications increasing, not decreasing, with the figure standing at , at the end of May.The report says an internal audit of the planningrevealed that there are a number of key controls absent from the local authorityrsquos planning system, in particular, its performance against legislative targets, the completeness and validation of documentation supporting applications and enforcement actions.The audit also points to a lack of clarity in respect of key performance indicators within the planning department and the lack of non-compliance by the local authority with its

leisure facility in Newcastle  ","story":"AMBITIOUS plans for a new community centre in the heart of Newcastle are expected to include an indoor water facility, it has emerged.Consultants have been appointed by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to complete a feasibility study on new leisure provision in the resort, with the current Newcastle Centre and adjoining Tropicana outdoor swimming pool the favoured site.Last October, the Recorder exclusively revealed that plans for a major new leisure facility in the heart of the town were back on the agenda, with consultants set to be asked to carry out a study of potential sites.Two locations were previously identied for a new multi-million pound leisure centre, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl which recently secured planning approval for an ultra-modern new store.Recognising that Newcastle is one Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, council officials are keen to deliver a new indoor facility which people can use all year round.Politicians are also keen for the local authority to take the lead and ensure a facility which has been talked about for decades is finally delivered in Newcastle mdash one that includes some form of indoor water facility.The council is keen to ascertain the proposed redevelopments costs for the entire Newcastle Centre site which includes the outdoor Tropicana pool and tourist information centre, the latter of which recently celebrated its th anniversary.Council officials want to know what the costs are so the scheme can be included in the local authorityrsquos capital development programme. They are keen to look at a mix of community facilities alongside some sort of indoor water leisure type facility which will replace the ageing Tropicana.In addition to plans for a new community centre, work is continuing on plans to secure a multi-million pound tourism bonanza for the resort through a series of innovative proposals.They are aimed at overhauling current tourist provision and signicantly increasing the number of overnight visitors to the resort as part of the City Deal initiative.A project board has been set up to help oversee the proposed investment initiative in Newcastle, with the local authority one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who hope to bid for a share of a poundbn investment package to fund a series of future projects, including tourism.The local authority and its City Deal partners have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive. It is anticipated that the city deal initiative has the potential to help the councils create , new jobs over a -year period.City deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is hoping to secure poundm from the NI Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund highly ambitious proposals in Newcastle aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort which form the core of its Mourne Gateway Project.Exciting proposals to signicantly enhance tourism attractions to draw international visitors to world class attractions in the resort include a gondola ride into the heart of the mountains and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.Other proposals include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy, an indoor activity centre in Donard Park, elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park and a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve.The ious proposals remain at an early stage and continue to be developed, with the next steps involving the development of a full outline business case for the overall project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ross selected for youth leadership programme  ","story":"A CROSSGAR teenager has been chosen to join the first group to begin a year-long international youth leadership programme which will culminate with a once in a letime trip to Los Angeles.Seventeen year-old Ross Farrell, a Year  student at Wellington College in Belfast, has earned his place on the IGNITE programme, a joint initiative between Belfast City Airport and Cinemagic, which will provide potentially le-changing opportunities for  young people over a five-year period.He was one of several students nominated by their schools who were then required to fill in an application form.Successful applicants were invited along to a selection day at the airport where they participated in a series of role-plays, team-building exercises and an interview.Jay Roewe, senior vice president of HBO, West Coast Productions, who is widely accredited for helping to bring Game of Thrones to Northern Ireland, met with the students at the launch of the programme at the airport.Michelle Hatfield, director of corporate services for George Best Belfast City Airport, said that over the course of the year, participants will collaborate with youth organisations, foundations, charities, representatives from other businesses in the private sector and also recognised names in the field of sport, film and politics.She added: ldquoWhilst the trip will conclude at a VIP gala event in Santa Monica, it is hoped that the lessons learned and the connections made by the young people involved will last a letime.Lord Mayor of Belfast John Finucane offered his encouragement to the young people participating in the programme.He said: ldquoIGNITE holds the potential to build the confidence, leadership and social skills of every young person involved.

I knew it could play to my strengths eventually, but being new to it, I wasnrsquot expecting to be as competitive just yet.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Number  called for Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe to be released immediately and said her family should be able to visit to check on her care.The Prime Ministerrsquos official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: ldquoWe are extremely concerned about Nazaninrsquos welfare and call for her immediate release, and we urge Iran to allow family members to visit her and check on her care.Before being transferred, Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe told relatives: ldquoI was healthy and happy when I came to Iran to see my parents.ldquoThree and a bit years later and I am admitted to a mental health clinic. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Richard Ratclfe, the husband of detained Nazanin Zaghari Ratclfe  --ldquoLook at me now, I ended up in an asylum.

I just hate it.In a press release, the Free Nazanin Campaign said it is not known what treatment she is receiving or how long she is expected to remain in hospital.The transfer comes after Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe went on hunger strike for  days last month in protest at her ldquounfair imprisonment. Mr Ratclfe also did not eat for the period in solidarity with his we as he camped on the pavement outside the Iranian Embassy in London.The couplersquos five-year-old daughter Gabriella has stayed in Iran with her grandparents since her motherrsquos arrest.Mr Ratclfe said: ldquoNazanin hoped that her hunger strike would move the Iranian authorities, and it clearly has.ldquoHopefully her transfer to hospital means that she is getting treatment and care, despite my distrust of just what pressures can happen behind closed doors. It is unnerving when we donrsquot know what is going on. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Ratclfe outside the Iranian Embassy in Knightsbridge  --ldquoI am glad her dad has been down there to keep vigil outside.ldquoMental hospital has its worries at the best of times ndash but particularly when kept isolated and under the control of the Revolutionary Guard.ldquoEven now it still seems like games of power and control are being played by the Iranian authorities ndash even at the point of hospitalisation.ldquoWe hope again this is the beginning of the end. And yet, we were also here last summer. ldquoWe will be following up with the new prime minister whenever that is decided to ensure he takes personal responsibility for Nazaninrsquos case.At the end of the dual hunger strike, Mr Ratclfe said he believed the protest had been successful in raising the profile of his wersquos case, with more than  MPs coming to show support to him in person, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.Earlier this year, Foreign Secretary and Tory leadership hopeful Jeremy Hunt granted Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe diplomatic protection in a bid to resolve her case.In a  gaffe, Boris Johnson, Mr Huntrsquos rival for the post of become prime minister, said that Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe was in Iran ldquoteaching people journalism ndash despite her familyrsquos insistence she was there to visit relatives.He has repeatedly said the responsibility for her continued detention lies with the Revolutionary Guard.Ellie Kennedy, Amnesty International UKrsquos iniduals at risk campaigner, said: ldquoYet again, the fear must be that the Iranian authorities are playing games with Nazaninrsquos health and well-being.ldquoThe fact that this has been done without her familyrsquos involvement suggests the real motive may be more to do with exerting pressure on Britain, rather than providing Nazanin with treatment.ldquoWe know from other cases, that the Iranian prison authorities will sometimes use a range of pressuring techniques with prisoners, often designed to coerce  confessions or sometimes simply to punish them further.ldquoAnd sometimes using prisoners as pawns in political battles.ldquoAfter all she and her family have been through, the time really has come for the Tehran authorities to bring this to an end, to release her and let her travel back to the UK with her daughter Gabriella..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Number  urges Iran to allow Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe us family to visit her article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Entries are now open for the  Deloitte Technology Fast  programme. The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years. Among the Northern Ireland firms making the last in previous years include First Derivatives and Novosco. A total of  firms from Northern Ireland made the list last year, with Belfast-based Repstor the highest-ranking Northern Ireland business at number  in the rankings. Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
