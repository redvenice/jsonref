They were welcomed by co-head teachers, Stephanie Shaldas and Edmund Coogan, and were introduced to some of the youngest pupils at a play session.Kate, in a pink Max \u0026amp Co coat, knelt down to talk to children in a pop-up cafe, while William helped a girl building a wall in the playground\u0027s construction area. Later he sat on a raised floor talking to a little boy who was brandishing a clipboard as Kate went to a water play area and then joined children in a sand pit hunting for treasure.\u0027Is it fun to be back with all your friends?\u0027 she asked them.Kate and William then joined teachers and staff involved in the Mentally Healthy Schools project to talk about its aims and impact on children.They sat in a circle outside the school because of Covid restrictions.

The Irish actor, famous for his neckchain and his leading role in Normal People, was in Sydney, Australia, for a new film, and the word was spreading. He was photographed running in Centennial Park. He was sighted at Tamarama Beach. He popped into an inner-city pub.But on the list of stars now working in Australia, Mescal – in Sydney for a musical film adaptation of Carmen – is comfortably mid-level. Thanks to its relative freedom from Covid-19 and associated restrictions, Australia – blessed with erse locations, sunny weather and a ready-made film infrastructure – has become Hollywood Down Under.Here for the latest instalment of Marvel’s Thor franchise are Natalie Portman, Matt Damon, Tessa Thompson, Chris Pratt, Christian Bale, the New Zealand director Taika Waititi and the Australian star Chris Hemsworth. Fellow Australian Isla Fisher and her husband, Sacha Baron Cohen, have relocated their family to Sydney, where the pair first met 20 years ago. Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban came back too.Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton were in the country earlier in the year to film Three Thousand Years of Longing. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson just wrapped in Queensland for the sitcom Young Rock. Zac Efron moved for the lifestyle first, then let the projects follow.When the news came on Wednesday that George Clooney and Julia Roberts would soon be joining their peers in the sun, the film’s title was as apt as A Star is Born, as subtle as Sharknado. It’s called Ticket to Paradise.The areas that these stars flock to – Byron Bay, Queensland’s Gold Coast, Sydney – are beach-fringed and beautiful. They are also Covid-free. New South Wales, the most populous state in Australia, has gone 54 days without a community-acquired case of the virus, and Queensland has racked up 64. California, meanwhile, recorded 3,518 new cases on Thursday and 268 deaths. Many of the stars have quarantined in luxury mansions or rolling country estates, with special exemptions that let them skip the hotels and state police and instead hire private security to enforce their isolation. As of this month, Efron was living in a “luxurious yet dated” four-bedroom property in the “Spanish-mission style” in Sydney, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.Damon, when he arrived in January, reportedly spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on private doctors, hospital-grade cleaning and guards, and issued a public statement saying he was determined to help keep Covid out and maintain Australia’s reputation as “the lucky country”.As Broadway shows shuttered and the studios of Hollywood lay under lock and key, filming in Australia has been a surreal experience for both sides of the equation. Portman told the chatshow host Jimmy Kimmel that Australia was “like a time-machine”, an alien, upside down world where “all the trees are different” and “there’s multicoloured parrots flying around like pigeons”.On the Gold Coast, state-of-the-art film studios are hosting Clooney and Roberts for their romcom, and the nearby hinterland will stand in for Thailand’s Chiang Rai province. In Sydney, Waititi has been filming the Marvel epic seemingly everywhere – at Fox Studios, at Centennial Park and on golf courses.For many residents, the frenzy has focused on the mundanity of faraway stars caught in the middle of everyday Australian life.A shot of the cast of Thor holding an umbrella from Bunnings Warehouse, a beloved Australian home and garden emporium, sent many minds into overdrive. Paparazzi shots of Portman wielding a trolley on an escalator at a shopping centre were treated like modern art.“Natalie Portman stocks up on a trolley full of vegetables,” was the headline in the Daily Mail Australia, with the simplicity of a Raymond Carver short story. “Natalie Portman and I buy the same brand of hummus from woolies,” said one Twitter user.The list of big projects filming in Sydney is long. Another Marvel film, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, starring Simu Liu and Awkwafina, recently wrapped up. And there are even more in the pipeline. Melissa McCarthy is filming a Netflix comedy, God’s Favourite Idiot, in regional New South Wales, while Ron Howard is shooting a film about the Thai cave rescue, called Thirteen Lives, in Queensland.Blacklight, a racing film starring Liam Neeson, tore through the wide and frequently empty streets of Canberra, the nation’s “bush capital”, in January. Under the cover of night, expensive black Porsches were smashed together at high velocity below the Majura Parkway.But from the US west coast to the Australian east, one thing has remained constant. When Hemsworth, Damon, Cohen and Fisher dined together in Sydney’s eastern suburbs on Thursday, the paparazzi and gossip columnists were there waiting. As he left, Hemsworth had a particularly Australian message for them: “See ya, dickheads.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64774e86ad469f6dfa986d5cd207942383501061/0_209_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8437ee94aede7ba6d97aa14f6addeb7e","title":"new us vehicles must be electric by 2030 to meet climate goals report","story":"The US should ensure almost all new cars and light vehicles sold are electric by the end of this decade, and stop using fossil fuels for power generation by 2035, to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris agreement, a new analysis has found.Such a target would be substantially tougher than the halving of emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, that many US civil society groups have espoused.Biden’s top advisers are working on a national plan for emissions cuts, called a nationally determined contribution, or NDC – a requirement of the Paris agreement. John Kerry, Biden’s climate chief, is expected to unveil the plan at a US-led climate summit on 22 April.Biden has plans to ensure the US fully decarbonises power generation in the next 15 years, which CAT said was consistent with meeting the goals of the Paris agreement, and to move towards electric vehicles, though he has not set a firm timeline for the latter.Countries are already spending trillions on rescuing their economies from the Covid-19 pandemic. “Now is the moment, when a lot of money is being spent, to ensure it is being spent not just to support the economy but to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” he said.Biden has also made clear his commitment to a long-term target for the US of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, joining scores of other countries that have also announced a net zero target in recent months. Those long-term targets mean that countries responsible for a majority of global greenhouse gas emissions have now pledged to reach net zero around mid-century, a goal scientists say must be met to stay within 1.5C or 2C.However, few countries have short-term targets aligned with that mid-century target, or detailed plans on how to reach their goals. That is where NDCs, a requirement of the Paris agreement, come in.The UN now wants all countries to re-examine the NDCs they have submitted, and is urging those yet to come forward with NDCs to do so as soon as possible, ahead of a vital UN climate summit this November, called Cop26 and to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow.China, the world’s biggest emitter, is also being closely watched. Last week, Beijing published the latest five-year plan, which sets out the government’s economic blueprint for 2021 to 2025, but it merely reiterated an existing goal of peaking emissions by 2030. Green experts said that was too late to have a chance of meeting the Paris goals, and China may revise the goal in its NDC.John Murton, the UK government’s envoy for Cop26, told a UK parliamentary committee on Thursday: “We are urging all countries to make commitments consistent with pathways to net zero.”Nathaniel Keohane, senior-vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund in the US, said: “After four years of the US going backwards on climate and falling behind, while the UK, EU, China and others moved ahead, this is the moment for the US to demonstrate leadership and set a stretch goal. What seems very clear from all the analyses that have been done to date is that the next target should start with a five."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b1a0ed09f6e003050c54b50f6f71288d18e6593/0_265_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12a60f76a79670f791f8f569000dcc84","title":"galapagos marine reserve plan ecologists ecuador fishing industry","story":"Ecuador’s president to decide on proposal to expand islands’ marine reserve, seen as vital to protect world heritage site from fishing industryStrolling along a beach dotted with sea lion pups and their mothers barking at one another, utterly unconcerned by your presence, is a singularly magical experience. On the trail leading to the shore on tiny Seymour Island, noisily courting blue-footed boobies and frigate birds are equally unruffled by the presence of humans.Getting up close to the natural world without disturbing it seems as refreshingly easy on the Galápagos Islands today as when Charles Darwin visited on HMS Beagle in 1835. Isolated from the mainland, the archipelago’s unique endemic species – from giant tortoises to finches – helped Darwin set out his theory of evolution in On the Origin of Species.One of the reasons the islands are such a hotbed of life is that the shallower, nutrient-rich waters around the volcanic atolls are fed by a confluence of cold and warm currents. This provides a refuge for an array of migratory ocean-going species, from scalloped hammerhead sharks to leatherback turtles.But it’s also why industrial foreign fishing fleets lurk at the edge of the Ecuadorian archipelago’s territorial waters. Nearly 250 vessels – 243 of them Chinese flagged, including vast fishing boats and refrigerated container ships – have logged an astounding 73,000 hours of fishing a month and pulled up thousands of tonnes of squid and fish.Ecuadorian tuna boats are there, too: they circle the Galápagos marine reserve – an area of 133,000 sq km (51,000 sq miles) – and float hundreds of fish aggregation devices, or FADs. Conservationists have been sounding the alarm, saying that unprecedented pressure from overfishing, and excessive bycatch of sharks and other species, now threaten marine life in the world-renowned archipelago.Their concerns have led to a new proposal: an expansion of the Galápagos marine reserve area, wrapping another swathe of protected ocean from the north, east and south around it like a scarf.Speaking to the , Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, said the proposal was based on his “government’s strong commitment to conservation, the protection of the environment and, in particular, the Galápagos Islands”. It was the same commitment he had set out at the COP25 UN climate change conference in 2019, he said.Many conservation organisations are thrilled by the idea. “It is the first-ever smart proposal which benefits fishermen, bioersity and reduces the impact of climate change,” said Matt Rand, director of the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy project.But not everyone agrees. The plan – which Moreno has notably not yet approved – would extend the marine reserve to 445,953 sq km, more than three times the size of the existing protected area.It would also shut out Ecuador’s larger tuna fishing boats from three-quarters of the archipelago’s exclusive economic zone, extending for 200 nautical miles around the existing reserve. An exception would be made in the zone’s south-western quarter, which would be set aside for “responsible fishing”.Fishing on the western side of the archipelago, which is about 620 miles (1,000km) from continental Ecuador, would have an impact on profits at a time of economic hardship, said Benincasa. In the Pacific port of Manta, the tuna industry provides work for up to 200,000 people, he said. The tuna sector makes up the vast majority of the country’s $1.6bn (£1.2bn) fishing industry.“We would have to seek fishing grounds much further away with much greater fuel consumption, as well as having to compete with the international fleets,” Benincasa added. Ecuador has the largest and most productive tuna fleet in the eastern Pacific region, and the second-largest in the world, with more than 100 purse-seine net tuna fishing boats and nearly as many long-liners.Whale sharks, great hammerhead sharks as well as leatherback turtles and waved albatross, have all become listed as critically endangered in the IUCN red list since 1998 as industrial-scale fishing has increased. They are among 14 marine migratory species found in the archipelago’s waters – including Galápagos fur seals and sea lions – whose conservation status has worsened in the past two decades. (The range of the waved albatross extends to southern Chile but it only nests on the island of Española.)But even though only small-scale fishing is allowed in the marine reserve, larger vessels get around the ban by luring the fish outside the protected zone using FADs. Known locally as plantados, they are used to target tuna, but sweep up other pelagic fish such as shark, sailfish and marlin, and attract sea lions, dolphins and turtles before drifting out of the marine park.Walter Borbor, an artisanal fisherman from Santa Cruz island who line-fishes for tuna, has come across many of the floating fish traps, which are basically wooden rafts with GPS trackers attached and nets hanging down for up to 100 metres.“The big boats throw them outside the reserve knowing there’s an infinity of currents that will carry them through and out again with a big shoal of smaller fish, which attract the bigger fish,” Borbor shouted over the noise of the outboard engine on his eight-metre fibreglass boat.“We’ve collected at least 30 plantados. We reuse the nets to make hammocks and chicken coops,” he said. Pulling up a thrashing yellowfin tuna, the diminutive fisherman said he must make increasingly longer fishing trips for a smaller catch.“Surrounding the islands there are many industrial boats that prevent the pelagic fish from coming in – they come here to spawn and to eat,” Borbor said.“The spillover effect shows just how successful the marine reserve has been,” said Norman Wray, president of the Galápagos governing council. “But now we need to expand it.”Robust fish populations have attracted too much pressure, Wray said, not just from the national fleet but from foreign vessels, which fish intensively on the edge of the exclusion zone.Moreno must decide whether to commit to the reserve’s expansion by signing a decree before he leaves office on 24 May.“An eventual increase in conservation measures in the Galápagos marine reserve would overlap with important areas of activity for the fishing sector, including artisanal fishing, with a possible negative impact for the national economy,” the president said when asked if he planned to expand the reserve. “For that reason, any analysis should be comprehensive, including all the environmental and socioeconomic aspects.”If Moreno does not sign the proposal into law, it could face a longer and more convoluted route, as a parliamentary committee on bioersity and natural resources would have to decide whether it should be debated and voted on in the national assembly.Juan Cárdenas, an assembly member on the committee, said he backed the expansion proposal because of the islands’ world heritage status. “I understand the position of the fishermen but they are not the interests of our nation,” he said.However, the powerful fishing industry is expected to exert its influence on Moreno and on whoever becomes the country’s next leader. Benincasa, the tuna industry representative, argued that as a developing country Ecuador could not afford to give away more of its ocean to conservation. “We shouldn’t be so naive,” he said.Conservationists hope further international support for the proposal to expand the Galápagos marine reserve could sway Moreno’s decision.“It would be an incredible legacy to leave,” said Cruz."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cf192cd22ae79dd197bdb1daf5448f827b5c34c/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ae962e5f79875b60003a6b570b228f13 960w","title":"the great global vaccine divide podcast","story":"The speed at which the world’s scientists have managed to create several effective Covid vaccines has been close to miraculous.

A tiny germ of controversy or rebellion can spread across parliament, through Whitehall and into the prime minister’s office within hours. The windowless offices are cramped, MPs sit elbow to elbow in a Commons chamber that can only squeeze just over 400 MPs into its seats, two-thirds of the number in parliament.It is also a place of macho presenteeism, where the Greggs in Westminster tube station often serves as a nightly dinner spot for some of the most senior office-holders in the land.This was the situation when Covid-19 arrived in the UK.  has spoken to a number of people who were there at the time. They revealed that the virus spread far more widely than has been reported, and spoke about the sense of panic across Whitehall as Covid threatened to paralyse government.Horrified staff and ministers, dealing with the worst crisis in decades, had to reckon with how the country could be run when everyone in charge was getting ill.Famously, Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock and Dominic Cummings contracted the virus. So did England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the then cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill. Ministers and their staff had it. Almost all the staff in Downing Street, too.It spread to special advisers across Whitehall and to parliamentary lobby journalists. Although the Palace of Westminster escaped any mass outbreaks among staff, several MPs caught Covid. Many in the office of the Labour leader, including Seumas Milne, had it. Jeremy Corbyn may have had it, although he was never tested and so has never been sure.But the situation was at its worst at the heart of Downing Street. For a number of days aides looked almost entirely to the then director of communications, Lee Cain, for direction.“No 10 was a plague pit,” one adviser recalls. “No one outside the postcode quite knows how bad it got in there.”Another said: “Lee was running the country, genuinely, for quite some time.”According to many of those present, almost the entire staff team in Downing Street caught Covid-19 at some point during those weeks, with James Slack, the prime minister’s spokesperson, a notable exception.“You’d got to a meeting expecting to see someone important and they were gone – and you knew why,” another adviser said. “It started off more surreal than scary, but it became very scary once the PM was so ill.”There are fewer workplaces less suited to social distancing than Westminster. High security means much business is conducted in person. MPs vote in packed and sweaty corridors. Staffers share desks. Most windows can only be heaved open a crack with brute force.Downing Street is far from opulent when compared with the palaces of most heads of state. Staff use small entrances and corridors with flaking paint and decorated only with laminated health and safety notices. In the weeks leading up to lockdown, staff acknowledge there was no social distancing to speak of, only jokes about how to most respectfully sing God Save the Queen while hand-washing.Staffers working in political and civil service roles during that time, who spoke on condition of anonymity as some are still in post, admit the pandemic took time to appear on the radar of a government preoccupied with a great election victory, Brexit and, closer to home, a purge of special advisers under Cummings’ iron fist.There were concerns, but there was also a lightheartedness. One aide held a birthday party for fellow Tories and served Corona beer. Johnson was sufficiently unconcerned to miss five Cobra meetings in January and February. It seems clear the UK was deeply unprepared for the pandemic – from out-of-date PPE to delayed preparedness training – while contingency planning was erted to a no-deal Brexit.Lindsay Hoyle, the newly elected Speaker of the House of Commons, said the whole of government did not see until quite late the extent to which Covid-19 would radically alter everyone’s lives.One of the few people still working in a high-profile job in Westminster who had experience of tackling a pandemic was the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth.“I was actually in Downing Street for swine flu 10 years ago,” the Labour MP said. “I remember when I first heard of the virus in Wuhan I thought: I wonder if that’s going to be like swine flu. But I obviously didn’t appreciate at that point it would be off the scale.”Ashworth asked for his first briefing with Whitty in January 2020. By February he was doing “nothing else” but studying the trajectory of the virus, he said. But it was when the health minister Nadine Dorries was confirmed to have Covid on 10 March that the magnitude of the crisis fully dawned on some of those in government. “The moment we realised this is probably more widespread in the country than we thought is when Nadine Dorries tested positive,” one health official said.At the time, people were only meant to get tested if they had been to one of the affected areas. “So the original assumption was, she hasn’t been to Italy or China so she hasn’t got Covid, even if she’s got some symptoms. And then she tested positive and I remember thinking: hang on, is this thing spreading much more widely than the people realise?”On 11 March, the day after Dorries tested positive, Liverpool played Atlético Madrid in front of a crowd of tens of thousands at Anfield. It was also the day of Rishi Sunak’s first budget. Many of those at the heart of the story who caught the virus admit they were slow to realise how fast it was spreading. One special adviser recalled starting to experience symptoms in the middle of a meeting with a national newspaper’s political editor.“Everyone was getting ill, it was quite striking how obvious it was,” one senior Labour official said.“It felt like a cold,” said another senior party official. “And you wouldn’t normally go home because you had a slight cough. But then I was eating something and it tasted like metal. And the inside of my nose felt weird. And that’s when I realised.”One political journalist who started feeling ill described being gripped by horror later in the afternoon when they remembered that the MP they had met earlier for coffee had breezily announced she was off to a meeting with her entire parliamentary party – and wondered how many they might have unwittingly infected.“It was so different because it directly affected everyone, I got so many calls from journalists or MPs asking for personal advice, what happens if I’ve had dinner here or I’ve met this person, or if I’ve been to see my 80-year-old mother,” one health official said.On 16 March, Johnson convened a meeting with Corbyn, Ashworth and staffers including Cummings and Milne, as well as Whitty, in Downing Street. It was intended to shore up Labour support for the coronavirus bill, introduced three days later. “Everyone was crowded around one desk,” one observer said. “It was insane if you think about it.”The Labour group argued forcefully for more economic intervention, given the spontaneous lockdown many people in the country were already beginning to observe. Two sources in the room said Johnson agreed with Corbyn and Ashworth that some form of full national lockdown would be inevitable. The meeting was cordial Milne and Johnson even shared a joke about their time as journalists.The meeting’s significance might have been passed over had it not been for what followed. Milne told friends he came down with a temperature that night – and was subsequently featured on the front page of the Mail on Sunday as the man who might have given the virus to the prime minister. Sources close to Corbyn said the then Labour leader also had some cold-like symptoms. Ashworth, who was also in the room, did not catch it.No one can say for sure who spread Covid to whom, because the virus was already rampant in Westminster.That evening Johnson advised people to avoid all unnecessary contact and travel and to stay away from pubs and theatresOn Wednesday 18 March, PMQs was quieter than usual but MPs still dribbled into the chamber. Sunak and Hancock, the health secretary, sat close to Johnson on the frontbench. Corbyn, despite being over 70, attended in person, with his spokesperson saying the government advice on shielding was still not clear.On the Friday evening, Johnson said pubs and restaurants should close and Sunak announced a furlough scheme. On Monday 23 March, in a ministerial broadcast from Downing Street, Johnson ordered the entire nation to stay at home.The first indication that officials outside Downing Street had that something was wrong with Johnson was a quiet inquiry by a No 10 special adviser to speak with Whitty on Wednesday. The chief medical officer advised the prime minister to get a test, which came back positive.Hancock began experiencing symptoms on 26 March, and rang his staff to say he had a temperature and was getting tested, prompting panic in the department about how to handle the media frenzy they anticipated should they have to announce the health secretary was ill with coronavirus. But within hours the prime minister tested positive, and that was the story.Johnson’s office realised in horror that one key person he might have infected was Hoyle, who has type 1 diabetes.“I got a phone call immediately. They were very worried about me, because the footage on the television was Boris six inches away speaking to me. And Hancock had also done the same in the same week,” Hoyle said. “I was very lucky, I didn’t get infected, but nobody could have got closer to either of them. I don’t believe it was caught in the house. Far from it. My worry was about them bringing it into the house.”Many of those staffers who fell ill like dominoes over the coming days tried to keep working. Hancock was isolating when he got a positive test but carried on issuing directions from home. “If anything he was almost more manic,” one official said.Another senior party insider said they and many others just worked through the virus, taking short naps in between calls. “Even though I was ill, I’d worked every day from home for a week and I just used to get very tired in the afternoon and go to bed for two hours. And then I kept on working.”“So much was happening by video and you could not always tell if people were at home because they were ill,” one aide said, describing it as “like playing wink murder” to spot who was trying to struggle through, or who was missing.Whitty was forced into self-isolation by Johnson’s diagnosis, as were many other staffers. Cummings, Johnson’s all-seeing chief of staff, departed London for Durham with his young family, his wife already sick and knowing he was likely to develop the illness.In the week after Johnson was diagnosed, it was not taken too seriously by staff, or the prime minister himself. He worked in isolation in Downing Street and would thump himself on the chest and say “strong as a bull!” and aides would laugh.But it was quietly becoming evident it was taking him a long time to shake off the virus.After making his daily joke, he would cough. Then cough for longer. Johnson was working in a small office connected by a stairwell to his No 11 flat next to another used by his private secretary and senior aides, who would toss paperwork and media scripts through the open door. Johnson chaired cabinet on 28 March by video link, “coughing and spluttering his way through conference calls”, according to sources, which leaked into newspapers. Public questions were starting to be asked about the prime minister’s condition.On Friday 3 April it was clear that Johnson’s symptoms were lingering and aides took a video in which an unkempt and clearly struggling prime minister said he “still has one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature”.The video was recorded on Johnson’s phone and took multiple different takes to record because he was coughing so much. Aides had to keep politely finding different ways to say: “I’m not sure we’ve quite nailed that there, boss.”Even then, Johnson was joking about trying to look well on camera and “uplift the nation”. Many felt at the time – and more now do in hindsight – that more should have been done that week to persuade him to rest.Advisers were getting worried. Discreet preparations were being made that week for Johnson’s admission to St Thomas’ hospital, should it be necessary.  got wind of this but it was denied by officials.By Sunday, it was necessary. Johnson phoned his senior staff before he left for hospital confirming Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, should take charge in his absence. Cummings was also out of the picture, ill in Durham.“It wasn’t actually scary – personally scary – until the PM almost died,” one senior official said. “From that moment you go from it being just a manic effort to get everything done to the consequences of it all hitting you so hard.”There was still a persistent attempt, outwardly, to pretend Johnson remained in charge. At the daily press briefing on Monday 6 April, Raab kept repeating that the prime minister was in “good spirits”. In fact, neither was true.That night Johnson was moved to ICU. He had told the nation he hoped to turn the tide in 12 weeks and that restrictions would be reviewed in three weeks. In that third week, he was in intensive care.The symbolism was not lost on many working closely with him. Johnson’s private secretary, Martin Reynolds, phoned Downing Street and said there was a “5050” chance the prime minister would be put on a ventilator. If this had happened, his chances of survival would have plummeted. Sedwill was in charge of drawing up a plan for succession if Johnson died – approved by the prime minister himself.No 10 at that point was like “a ghost ship”, as one aide put it. Cummings was in Durham, Cain was on his last day of self-isolation.“Lee came in like a bullet the next day,” one colleague recalls. “There was a meeting he turned up to with Raab, Sedwill and other civil servants and he was like: ‘Hello, I’m back, I’m in charge of the politics now.’”The political staff in No 10, particularly those with a background in Conservative internecine politics, were also starting to think about the nightmare scenario of the death of the prime minister. “You knew the party would have forced some awful leadership election, it would have been carnage,” one said. “It was about confronting the utter horror of that – in a pandemic – and feeling pretty overwhelmed with emotion, too.”Representing one of the flaws of the British political system, Downing Street resembles the court of a medieval king. What matters is the prime minister, and who matters are those who have the ear of the prime minister. Advisers fall in and out of favour and only a few are known to be directly speaking for the prime minister – those who can therefore be taken seriously. When the prime minister is suddenly absent, the system no longer works.“There’s a gap, like physically, in the building, and there was a bit of a gap politically,” one former adviser said.“The two main characters – Johnson and Cummings – were absent,” one No 10 insider said.“When the court doesn’t have a king, it’s just a massive vacuum,” another former staffer said. “The only reason senior people had authority is because they spoke with his voice. So when you remove him, it becomes very, very difficult to keep that authority.”“Boris in particular, his presence is really felt, he takes up space,” another ex-staffer said. “And the other person who had that presence was Dom. And he was gone as well.”“That week was hell,” another official said. “There were all these meetings where it was never completely clear who was driving things or in charge. Who was actually going to be there if you had a meeting?”Those who recovered were desperate to get back into work. “I remember saying I have to be there, I’m going mad at home,” a Whitehall source said. At the time, civil servants were ordered to work from home but many in No 10 wanted to be in the building. Cain told them they could come in if they wanted and he would take the flak.“Lee did end up running the country for about two weeks, I’d say,” one adviser said. “There was no one else any sort of senior level who had any sort of authority on behalf of the PM to be doing stuff or making decisions.”Ministers’ aides were buddied up and told to get to grips with a different department so they could shadow each other if another fell sick.Cain had been at the prime minister’s side for years, through his time at Vote Leave, to the Foreign Office, to his time on the backbenches and through his leadership campaign. Even more than Cummings, Cain was seen by people in Whitehall as speaking with his boss’s voice. “It was a bit like a very long marriage,” one close friend said.Raab, the “designated survivor”, as he was nicknamed, took charge of the day-to-day business as part of a quad of ministers with Sunak, Hancock and Michael Gove. Hancock was often the target in those meetings as the government struggled with PPE shortages, deep concerns over ventilator capacity and what many felt were wildly optimistic promises by the health secretary on testing.Raab felt his role was to be a stabilising force, one aide said. “He was a good manager, he didn’t push his own agenda. It was just a holding position. But he didn’t step up in the way Rishi stepped up. You’d hardly say it was a moment for Dom Raab.”Others described Raab’s understated attitude to the role as a strength. “He had a lot of big jostling egos to manage in the cabinet and he managed it,” an aide said.A senior Downing Street source said it was like “chalk and cheese” working with Raab versus working with Johnson. The prime minister would hand out jobs from his red box, happy to delegate – “a bit more loosey-goosey” as one insider put it. Raab was extremely strict with protocol and insisted everything went through Cain.In the prime minister’s absence, battle lines were also starting to be drawn between those who believed opening the economy was imperative and those who believed a long lockdown was necessary.Cummings spent much of his isolation reading about the Spanish flu pandemic and told advisers after he returned that he had been convinced of the need for tougher measures and slower reopenings. There was some political calculation at play as well: Cain and the Tory adviser Isaac Levido believed the party would be annihilated at the next election if there was a catastrophic death toll, whereas voters would be more forgiving of economic turmoil.Among those in favour of “running in hot”, which one characterised as “trying to allow desperate business owners to salvage their livelihoods”, were Sunak and the prime minister’s chief of staff, Edward Lister, who was shielding at home for much of the period. Newspapers were constantly briefed about the rows between “doves and hawks”.Gove was someone who “jumped from one camp to the other”, one adviser said, though in latter months he has been a more predictable voice of caution, alongside Hancock. In those early weeks, it was drily observed in Whitehall that Gove always seemed to be characterised as a hawk, whatever his position.No 10 and Whitehall were beset by leaks during that period, on the very biggest issues. “It’s fucking Zoom,” a special adviser said. “You’d log on to a sensitive meeting and you think it’s going to be five key people and then you’re like, hang on, why are there 80 people here and who the hell are they? We may as well broadcast this thing live to the world.”The daily 9.15am call between Raab, Sunak, Gove and Hancock would constantly leak. “Rish just got to the point where he wouldn’t even say anything in the meeting,” one insider said.With Johnson temporarily out of the picture, political aides suggested there were some attempts by ministers or civil servants to quietly discard unpopular issues. An adviser recalls a suggestion that a legal signoff connected with HS2 was needed – and that it be delayed until the prime minister’s return. “One of the first things the PM said when he got back was: ‘I can’t believe they tried to delay HS2 while I was in the ICU.’”“People really pushed their luck during that time – cabinet ministers, civil servants,” a senior aide said. “People delivered statements for approval by No 10 just 10 minutes before they were supposed to deliver them at the press conference and we had to be like: hang the fuck on!”All the actions of staff during that period are likely to be the subject of a public inquiry – perhaps the most important undertaking in living memory. Many believe the mistakes that were made were not a direct result of the way the virus ripped through the heart of Westminster and hobbled the operations of the government, but predictable consequences of a decade of deliberate policy.“I wasn’t in government. So I don’t know the extent that people being off ill hindered the decision-making on a day-to-day basis,” Ashworth said. “But the reason our response has been so disappointing and why we’ve been so exposed is because of decisions made over many years. The absolute scandal about the way in which we allowed the virus to rip through social care, not giving their staff sick pay, which meant that staff had to go to work.“We’ve built an economy which is characterised by zero-hours contracts, temporary work. These are all a reflection of the type of economy that the Tories have built over the last 10 years.”Johnson returned to Downing Street on 12 April to a team that felt “overwhelmed with relief”, according to one staffer. He went to recuperate with his pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, who was also recovering from the virus.But any reprieve would be very short-lived. The day he returned was the same day Cummings set out for his drive to Barnard Castle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66988f7cbd9da063eeb8f61f251d11aa326caf94/0_158_5016_3009/master/5016.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7d0a915a2a3459bd0db37c3fcd046944","title":"can you kick it the definitive womens football quiz","story":"Women’s football has seen its audience rise to a whopping 1.12 billion viewers – but are you one of them?

Playing with her local club from a young age, she knew a big move was inevitable if she wanted to play at the highest level.In fact, it was the young women in the national team, the Football Ferns, who inspired Moore the most.“I think because New Zealand is so remote from everywhere else, I idolised a lot of the girls from our national framework. They’re actually still there now, and I remember when I had my first tour with the Football Ferns and I’d had those players on my wall – then I was going to training with them for the first time.“Players like Abby Erceg, Ria Percival, Amber Hearn, Ali Riley – all those girls were influential because I saw them, and I was like: ‘I want to do that, I want to be in the Football Ferns environment, I want to follow in their footsteps.’”The first leg of her journey was to Germany, where she played first for FC Köln in the women’s Bundesliga during the 2017-18 season. A couple of seasons at Duisburg followed, including a bad injury just ahead of the 2019 Women’s World Cup, before she signed with Liverpool, at the beginning of this season, where she is fitting right in.“Coming from New Zealand, we’re very carefree – we’re just living the life and quite chilled. So I think coming to Liverpool, it’s quite similar to home – you could say there’s a lot of banter between the girls, we get along quite well.”That said, it’s not always easy living so far from home.“I’m quite family-oriented, so that’s a really important thing for me. I regularly keep in contact with my mum and sisters, my grandma – I schedule in weekly video calls, because it’s so important to me. And being so far away, it’s important for me to keep those connections close, to be able to lean on when I need to.”When disaster struck and Moore tore her achilles while training in France ahead of the 2019 Women’s World Cup, she was lucky, she says, that her family was already travelling to Europe on the same day, and so they were present when she woke from surgery.Though Moore realises injury is “part of the game”, a tough time followed as she underwent rehabilitation in Christchurch, New Zealand, afterwards. However, it was in these difficult moments that she realised who the most important figures in her journey were. Her family, and in particular, her mum, who she describes as her “rock”, and says she is on the phone to straight away regardless of the 13-hour time difference, whenever she has a problem.She also hailed her physiotherapist, Tamsin, as a key figure in her recovery.“I couldn’t have done it without her, and I do think you notice in those sorts of times how important the people around you are – how much you can, and need to rely on them to get through it.”But Moore isn’t used to being confined to one place for too long. She loves travel and long journeys – in which she makes sure she always has some good music and a book with her when she’s on the road. But she is getting settled in Liverpool now and, as a big coffee drinker, can’t wait for normality to resume so she can explore some of the city’s cafes.Another thing Moore misses is playing in full stadiums. “The people make the atmosphere, and the people make the game, so to be able to play in a packed stadium again will be pretty cool,” she says.“It’s always nice to be able to play in front of people and hear them cheering behind you, but we know that it’s not possible right now and since coming here I have felt a lot of love.”In terms of where she wants to be next, there is only one destination, she says: “Anfield.”Expedia believes that travel, like football, is better experienced together.

The goalkeeper talks to Jen Offord about her journey to Liverpool and who’s been with her en routeAt just 22, goalkeeper Rylee Foster has already travelled much of the globe, having visited every continent except Africa. She’s played for Canada under-20s, and spent four years at West Virginia University, but Liverpool has always been her dream destination. With strong family ties to the city, it feels fitting to her that this is where she has started her professional career.“I don’t think I had a choice when I was born,” she says, “I supported Liverpool for as long as I can remember.”Foster’s paternal grandparents were born and raised in the Wavertree area of Liverpool and travelled to Canada after the second world war. Though her father was born in Canada, Foster says the connection to Liverpool never left.“It was something that was in a sense drilled into me as a young kid, watching the matches every weekend with my dad or my mum, and my sisters on the couch,” she says.Her grandparents were also key figures in her early footballing aspirations.“My grandparents used to come to my matches and there were always words of wisdom: ‘Just keep your elbows up and don’t let anyone take you down. If someone comes close just give them a little knock – whatever you’ve got to do to keep strong.’”After her beloved grandmother passed away in 2013, Foster had the words of the famous Liverpool anthem You’ll Never Walk Alone tattooed on one of her biceps in memoriam. It was, she says, a reminder that her grandmother would always be with her.“But it also rooted me into my culture. I just wanted to have that reminder to keep going forward and keep representing my family, but also the Liverpool crest with as much pride as I could.“To be the first one to be able to return back to Liverpool and to have roots here to start something new and carry on the Foster name in the city is an honour.”Foster’s family is clearly as integral to her football journey as much as the physical one she has taken to be here, acting as her cheerleaders and support network.She started playing football around the age of five, when her father took her and her sisters to the local park. These are, she says, some of her fondest memories. But as well as starting her on her journey, her family gave so much and put everything else aside to make sure she was able to fulfil her potential.Not living close to a competitive training ground, her entire family would follow her for the hour-and-a-half journey to practice and back.“My dad would leave early to come and pick me up, my mum would take my sisters and they would miss time with their friends and do their homework in the car.”Given how close they are, and how meaningful her career move is to the entire family, it’s not ideal, says Foster, that they can’t be with her at the moment. Her sisters were able to visit during the year she has been in Liverpool, and her mother also came with her when she first signed with the club. Next, she really hopes her dad will be able to visit.“It’s been a dream for me to make that happen,” she says. “Just be at a match together, for him to see the Kop and be in that experience, that environment, would mean the world to me.”Although Foster hasn’t had much time with the club under Covid-free circumstances, having joined in January 2020, she’s already had a taste of the incredible fanbase Liverpool are known for.“The football culture here is amazing. We talk about the fans, but it’s not even that it’s a thing that they love, it’s like a religion, which is how I’ve felt all my life – so to be immersed in a culture like that is so fun and so cool.”“When I walk on to the pitch and hear You’ll Never Walk Alone, it kind of hits home a little bit more. It actually brings a tear to my eye every time I hear it.”Since she’s been in Liverpool, she’s been impressed by the food culture and lists Bold Street as one of her must-visit places. She’s also enjoyed travelling by foot to take in the historic buildings, particularly around the docks, as well as getting to know her fellow scousers.“If I’m wearing the kit in town it’s an automatic conversation. Other cities I’ve been in, they don’t really care to have that conversation, they kind of look at you and walk by, but people here want to get to know you and know where you’re from. I think it’s so cool to be able to make those connections.”Finally, of course, there’s Anfield itself, which is, in her opinion, “breathtaking”.Though it may have been chaotic at times, Foster is proud to have travelled so much, and is grateful for the opportunities football has given her.“When you’re going there for football you get a different feel for these countries, you don’t get the resort style stuff you get to see the inner cities and what the people are like – you can talk to the people and relate to them. I’m pretty lucky to be able to learn while being able to experience some of the greatest places in the world.”But that doesn’t mean she’s not keen to enjoy some leisurely travel too. She’s looking forward to seeing the Blue Lagoon in Iceland and surfing in Hawaii when things get back to normal. “I don’t think I’d be very good at surfing,” she ponders, “but I’ll try it.”Expedia believes that travel, like football, is better experienced together.

Now, at only 19, she’s one of Liverpool FC Women’s brightest stars. Here, she talks about the people who have been with her all the wayFor homegrown talent Missy Bo Kearns, playing at Anfield is the dream. Though the 19-year-old’s career may have grown – like many others – from humble beginnings, she is well connected in the local football community, and counts Liverpool royalty Jamie Carragher as one of her confidants.“I think growing up Steven Gerrard was my idol and I always looked up to him,” she says. “But now, I speak to Jamie Carragher quite regularly – he’s my dad’s friend – and he gives me the best advice I’ve probably had in football. He’s always there if I need to ask him anything, and I know he’s been there himself.”If that wasn’t enough, Kearns also credits Lioness, Atlético Madrid forward and ex-Everton player Toni Duggan as having been instrumental in her career. Duggan was a huge source of inspiration to the young footballer, having attended the same youth club in Liverpool.Kearns started playing football at the age of four with her cousins in the garden, and joined a local team with her cousin. She trialled and signed for Liverpool at the age of eight, and worked her way through each of the age groups at the club before breaking through into the first team last year. Though, it could have been different for the midfielder.Female role models are important in this game, with the age-old adage: if you can’t see it, you can’t be it – and Kearns hopes to return the favour one day.“Knowing what Toni has done for me, if I can do that for other young girls, that’s amazing – it’s got me where I am today. So if I can help, I’d love to.”Another important female figure in her football journey is her grandmother, who she says she has successfully converted to the beautiful game.“Believe it or not, she never used to watch football,” Kearns says. “But now she’s starting to get into it more. She used to watch when it was just me, but now she’ll watch actual games on the TV.”Kearns’s grandma also fulfilled the role of backroom staff as well as fanbase, and would pick her up from school, get her ready and take her to training. Several times a week, whatever the weather, she was always ready to help.“If she’d not done that while my parents were at work, I wouldn’t be where I am today. I’m grateful for what she’s done for me.”Like many of her fellow Liverpudlians, Kearns is an avid football fan, as well as a player, and is part of what she thinks of as “one big family”.“I was watching football in the house before I even played it. I was going to Anfield, so I’ve been brought up into football and I think being a Liverpool fan, it makes you want to follow football more because of the passion and how big a club it is. It’s just unbelievable when you’re in the stadiums feeling it, home and away, how much it actually means to the fans watching the team.”In her free time, as well as hanging out with friends in the city, and particularly the Royal Albert Dock, Kearns is a regular in the stands at Anfield, and appreciates the role of fans both as a player and supporter.“I think for us, as the women’s team, when the fans are there you feel like you’ve got more players on the pitch. You feel privileged that they’ve come out to watch you and support you.”Kearns has big aspirations for her career, hoping to get Liverpool back into the Women’s Super League, and hopefully winning some trophies.When she’s on the road now, to the slightly less exotic locations of Charlton in south-east London, and Maiden Castle in Durham, you’ll most likely find her with best friend Jade Bailey on the team bus, and she takes her PlayStation 5 with her everywhere to “relax”, she says. She hopes there might be some longer journeys in the future, though.“There’s loads of places I’d like to play,” she says, quickly clarifying, “as an away team, though.”Anfield is the dream, she says, but she thinks Barcelona’s famous Nou Camp would be a “good experience”. And she’d like to experience the atmosphere at Ajax’s Johan Cruyff Arena.“I just think Ajax fans are brilliant,” she says of the Dutch Ereisie club.She’d also love to play at German Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund’s Westfalenstadion for the atmosphere and another familiar reason.“They sing You’ll Never Walk Alone, too,” she says, referencing Liverpool’s famous anthem. “I’d probably get goosebumps.”Expedia believes that travel, like football, is better experienced together.

They said: “It’s been used by lecturers and, historically, has been ignored when students have raised it, and now you have just used it in a public meeting with students.“Like many students have been saying, I find it unacceptable myself that you have used that word in a meeting. Absolutely unacceptable.”Another student added: “I’m sorry but you are not a black man, you can’t use that word.”Habib then said, in response to a black student saying he shouldn’t use the word: “I’m sorry I offended you. I come from a part of the world when somebody uses it, the context matters. What I was trying to simply say is that if you find it offensive I’m sorry.”After the meeting, discussions among parts of the student community raised the issue of Habib potentially resigning after his comments.Habib posted a series of messages on Twitter in which he reiterated he had apologised and said: “The question is: why is it that after this apology, some are still politicising the issue?”He added: “So why don’t I think it was problematic to use the word when I did. Well, because context matters and I was arguing for taking punitive action. You cannot impute maligned intention without understanding context. Do I believe that only blacks can verbalise the word. No, I don’t.“I am aware that this is a common view among activists committed to an identitarian politics. I don’t identify with this political tradition. I grew up in a political tradition that is more cosmopolitan oriented and more focused on the class dimensions of structural problems.”Hisham Pryce-Parchment, the student union’s anti-racism officer who was present at the meeting, said many students posted on social media afterwards saying Habib should resign, and that an apology would not be enough.“He doesn’t actually grasp, and seems incapable of grasping the violence of the words, particularly for black students,” he said. “The whole thing was shocking from start to finish.”He added: “I know that many black students quit the call and didn’t wait for the end of it when he said that. I don’t think he can just apologise and we can be like: ‘OK, let’s move on.’”The student union issued a statement saying that what happened at the meeting was “unacceptable, disgusting and to be unequivocally rejected”. It is also considering what steps it should take, with one option being to launch a university-wide referendum on whether Habib should be removed as director.Sabrina Shah, the co-president for democracy and education at the student union, said that after students had expressed discomfort and challenged Habib on saying the word aloud, he doubled down.“After being challenged on using that word and explicitly being told it is unacceptable, and rather than retracting it and understanding and recognising the harm that was caused, he doubled down and said that it is acceptable to be using those terms.”Yasmin Elsouda, the co-president for welfare and campaigns, reiterated how students felt shocked by the incident. “I think that his comments were extremely harmful. So obviously him answering that question in that way and saying that word is absolutely shocking.”Habib told the : “A student did indeed pose a question that Soas was not responsive to anti-black racism and suggested that a staff member who used the word is still on the payroll. I did indeed use the word and said the following: ‘If someone used the word against another staff member, then it would violate our policy and the case should be brought to my attention.’ I also said that this is the first that I had heard of the incident.“I then did apologise saying that no offence was intended, and I again said that if the word was used by a staff against another human being, then it would be a disciplinary offence as it would violate our policies.“I am not sure why I should resign. No malevolent intention was behind my mention of the word. If anything, it was the opposite: a commitment to act if the word was used against another human being by anyone within our institutional community.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7bffee0af55b9b79fb262bcfc1429b0ce545030/0_24_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=1c2d45a740f6a10799f087870be3b888","title":"coronavirus live news uk businesses sign up for rapid testing scheme surge in philippines infections","story":"Australia has recorded first local Covid-19 case in more than two weeks after a doctor tested positive for the coronavirus, triggering restrictions in area hospitals and urgent contact tracing of her patients. Annastacia Palaszczuk, the Queensland state premier, said the unnamed doctor last week treated two patients who had recently returned to Australia and had tested positive for the UK variant.  “We know this doctor, who assessed these two COVID-positive patients was at the hospital at the time. Now, she developed symptoms,” Palaszczuk was quoted as saying by Reuters. It was Australia’s first local infection since 24 February. As officials seek to determine the size of the outbreak, Palaszczuk said, all hospitals in the state capital will be closed to visitors. The authorities have yet to determine how many people the doctor treated before testing positive. Australia has reported just over 29,000 coronavirus infections and 909 deaths from Covid-19, far fewer than many developed countries. Russia reported 9,908 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, including 1,600 in Moscow, taking its total case tally to 4,380,525 since the pandemic began, Reuters reports.  The government coronavirus task force also said that 475 people had died in the last 24 hours, pushing its death toll to 91,695. India is to begin a review of side effects from the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine after several countries suspended its distribution over fears that it was causing blood clots in otherwise healthy recipients. The World Health Organization has said there was no reason to stop using the vaccine, but Denmark, Norway and Iceland have paused its use as a precaution. India has so far distributed at least 28 million shots in a vast vaccination programme. Most of them have been AstraZeneca vaccines, which are produced at the Serum Institute of India.At least 2 million people were vaccinated on Friday alone, as Covid-19 cases were rising across different Indian states after weeks of decline.“We are looking at all the adverse events, particularly serious adverse events like deaths and hospitalisation. We will come back if we find anything of concern,” NK Arora, a member of India’s national task force on Covid-19, told AFP.Arora said there was “no immediate issue of concern as number of adverse events (in India) is very, very low. We are relooking at (adverse events that were reported) to see if there was any issue of blood clotting.”“As of yesterday there were 59 or 60 deaths, and they were all coincidental,” he said, adding hospitalisation cases were being re-examined. “In fact there is a real effort from our side that once complete investigation is done, to put its results in public domain, on the ministry of health website,” Arora added.The Philippines has detected its first case of the coronavirus variant first identified in Brazil, Reuters reports citing the country’s health ministry. A statement from the ministry said that a Filipino returning from Brazil had tested positive for the P.1 variant after 752 samples were sequenced at the genome centre. The ministry also reported 59 new infections of the B117 variant first detected in Britain, and 32 cases of the B1351 variant discovered in South Africa. This brings cases for those variants to 177 and 90, respectively. Infections are on the rise again in the Philippines, which has the second-highest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in south-east Asia. The country started a mass vaccination programme on 1 March.The health ministry reported 5,000 new coronavirus cases, the largest single-day increase in more than six months, and 72 additional deaths. Confirmed cases have increased to 616,611 while confirmed deaths have reached 12,766. Matt Hancock, the UK health secretary, has said that more than 48,000 businesses have signed up to offer rapid coronavirus testing to their employees, a move he said would be a “huge step forward” in getting businesses “back on their feet”.Announcing the latest scheme, Hancock said: We have built a huge asymptomatic testing system from scratch, which is an essential part of our plan to reopen cautiously.Rapid testing has been rolled out at a vast scale across a range of sectors, and it is fantastic that now over 48,000 businesses have signed up to offer rapid testing to employees. This is a huge step forward in getting businesses back on their feet and helping to keep people safe.With around one in three people with the virus not having symptoms, regular testing is essential to bearing down on the virus and identify new variants of concern as we work towards restoring normal life.I strongly encourage all businesses to register their interest before the 31 March deadline.This is Damien Gayle kicking off the live blog from London.

Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 157,072 had received their second dose.Some 170,570 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 273,215 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 108,932 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp295 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 300 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.The next categories are: people aged 65-69 years an ill-defined group referred to as “key workers” and people aged 18-64 with certain medical conditions. Next up will be: those living or working in crowded conditions people working in education those aged 55-64 workers in other occupations important to the functioning of society people aged between 18 and 54 and, finally, pregnant women and those under 18.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket should begin to receive their first dose by March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4508729.1615564075!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"is ireland facing another covid 19 wave or is a blip being used to put the frighteners on","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘We are sailing very close to the wind,’ said Nphet’s modelling expert Prof Philip Nolan on Thursday. ‘A gust of wind in the wrong direction and we’re in real trouble.’ Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins.The change shows up as a small uptick on the graph of daily case numbers, but after two months of mostly steady decline it was sufficient to cast an air of gloom over Thursday’s National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) briefing.“We are sailing very close to the wind,” said Nphet’s modelling expert Prof Philip Nolan. “A gust of wind in the wrong direction and we’re in real trouble.”Was the increase in cases this week really evidence of the beginning of another wave of Covid-19? Or was it a blip seized upon in order to put the frighteners on people and shore up declining compliance with public health advice?Time will tell. The wider issue is why Ireland is stuck at about 500 cases every day, months into a third lockdown and despite the rollout of vaccines. Progress on case number has been slowing for weeks now, and the reproduction number, the number of infections linked to each confirmed case, is hovering just below 1.Have all our sacrifices been in vain? Are we not doing things right? Will it mean further delay in easing restrictions or even the imposition of new ones? These are inevitable questions for an increasingly frustrated public.Nphet explains our current impasse by pointing to the more transmissible, and now dominant, B117 strain first identified in the UK. Without B117, Ireland would be down to about 20 cases a day, according to some experts.MinglingInstead of that, any increase in mingling in the population is “rewarded” with more new cases, many more than would have been the case last year when the variant was not present. It may also give rise to more serious illness than was the case with other variants. Other countries have seen cases rise as B117 makes inroads.Nphet has focused on mobility, as measured by Google tracking of our household and workplace movements, as an extra factor behind the increase in cases. There is also data on where people use their phone, or withdraw money from ATMs, but none of this information tells anything about whether people are observing social distancing or isolation rules, for example.It takes infected people to pass on this disease. The Nphet view tells us little about where the new cases are arising. Though 900 people are now working in contact tracing, only sparse information emerges about outbreak patterns. A few weeks ago, it took the media to highlight large student clusters in Galway and Limerick this week, the only specific references by Nphet was to outbreaks in workplaces and among Travellers.The public health doctors employed to track disease tell a different story of a lack of resources of having to rely on pen and paper and basic Excel spreadsheets of outdated computer systems that don’t talk to each other.“There are almost no supports put into investigating the chains of transmission” of the disease, public health doctor Dr Ina Kelly told RTÉ’s PrimeTime this week. Another says: “We’re no better equipped than a year ago”.A month ago, Nphet said one-quarter of cases were not being followed up to establish the source of infection. The situation seems not to have improved since.Blunt instrumentCould this be the reason for relying on the blunt instrument of lockdown for so long? Currently, 10 counties appear to have effectively suppressed the virus, with average daily case numbers in single figures, yet they are treated the same as other parts of the country with big outbreaks.Meanwhile, vaccination is changing the calculus of lockdown, rapidly and massively. Cases have fallen off a cliff in healthcare settings and in nursing homes after staff, patients and residents were inoculated. Deaths are declining, too, as the most vulnerable groups are protected.Israel’s experience shows you can still have active transmission even when most of the population is immunised. But the capacity for harm is greatly reduced, so the rationale for severe restrictions is greatly weakened.Ireland hasn’t reached that point yet, of course, though the way our vaccination programme has been targeted at specific vulnerable groups means they should soon be able to enjoy a wider “vaccine bonus” than is currently proposed.The rest of us can only wait, watch the stop-and-go nature of the vaccine rollout and wonder when we will be able to buy children’s shoes again.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe State has stopped collecting data on whether people are travelling into the State for an essential reason since early February, it has emerged, including seeking such information from those travelling from high-risk countries.According to figures collected for the first week in February, the last week when such information was sought from incoming passengers, 46.3 per cent of 12,659 people claimed they were travelling for essential reasons.Ms Shortall, the Social Democrats’ co-leader, said there was no apparent reason why passengers were no longer being asked to state whether they were travelling for essential reasons. “It seems to be a move which will only serve to obfuscate the facts on international travel. Why was this decision taken and are there any grounds for it?” she asked.She said the Government should “be making every effort to increase transparency and public access to data, whether that is in relation to travel, vaccines or case numbers – not reduce it”.Asked why the essential travel data was no longer gathered, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health said it was “removed from the form in February with the introduction of new regulations on mandatory quarantine”. Restrictions on arrivals from Brazil and South Africa were imposed on January 26th, but plans to introduce mandatory hotel quarantine quickly have so far stalled.Separate figures released to the Dublin North-West TD show that almost 10 per cent of people arriving into the State in February – after the Government announced its intention to clamp down on travel – are coming from or recently travelled through countries where “variants of concern” are prevalent, while new statistics show more than 4,000 people arrived from countries where there is heightened concern over coronavirus variants. Category two countriesIn all, 4,172 people arrived into the Republic from one of the 33 category two countries, or whose recent travel history included one. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is one of only two schedule two countries with direct links to Ireland, accounted for almost half of the arrivals, with 1,828. Some 1,465 people were associated with recent travel from Brazil, while 313 reported South Africa on their forms. Austria, the only European country on the list, accounted for 149 arrivals, with 96 linked to Argentina, and 321 passengers disclosed recent travel to another of the 28 countries on the list. The arrivals account for 8.6 per cent of passenger locator forms completed between February 8th and March 7th. The Department of Health has said it is in advanced discussions with an operator for the mandatory hotel quarantine service, but an anticipated announcement of the counterparty to the deal and when the service would begin did not materialise this week. Ms Shortall said the figures “underline how vulnerable we are to the importation of the virus from overseas”.“It goes to show the important role for mandatory hotel quarantine, which needs to be implemented very quickly and be applied to passengers from all countries if we are in any way serious about protecting our public from further spread of the virus and these variants.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4509086.1615585070!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord s week a win for the invisible women of leinster house","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThese women appear to have been subject to an Upstairs, Downstairs regime in Leinster House, left without basic facilities. Photograph: Alan BetsonLeinster House is a big old building, and big old buildings are a devil to keep clean.The cleaners – almost all women – are on the go from the crack of dawn to the end of the day. They do a hard job and a good job and are unfailingly pleasant when you meet them around the place.These women appear to have been subject to an Upstairs, Downstairs regime in Leinster House, left without basic facilities available to other workers in the building. A more probable explanation is that they were simply overlooked by the powers-that-be on Kildare Street.Now representations have been made on their behalf to the all-powerful Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. Most of the cleaners are employed by an outside contractor, ISS.The chairwoman of the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus, Fiona O’Loughlin, wrote to the Ceann Comhairle last month after a concerned female member of the permanent staff drew her attention to the cleaners’ circumstances and how they did not enjoy facilities open to the rest of the workers on the Leinster House campus.This included use of the self-service restaurant and the coffee dock frequented by politicians, staff, media and visitors. They had no lockers, no place to change, no dedicated rest or meeting area, no way of making a cup of tea or access to the wifi.Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl, who heads the commission, quickly responded to Senator Fiona O’Loughlin’s email. He indicated steps were already under way to improve the situation.“At the outset, I should state that the cleaning staff, who are mainly employed by ISS, are a very important part of our parliamentary community. They perform a function that is very much appreciated and indeed they have made, and continue to make, a major contribution to the Houses of the Oireachtas during the Covid-19 pandemic,” he wrote, before giving a rundown on the current situation.He has been advised that all the cleaning staff may use kitchenettes around the complex, the self-service restaurant and the coffee dock. A Portacabin has been set up for use in a service yard to the side of the building. This is a temporary measure, and once Covid-19 restrictions have eased, the commission will be in a much better place to consider a dedicated space for the cleaning staff.“A kettle, fridge and microwave will be provided shortly (these appliances are ordered).”The facilities unit is examining the installation of lockers, while there is no difficulty in providing access to wifi.“As similar correspondence was considered by the Oireachtas Commission at its meeting on November 30th, 2020, there may be some misunderstanding regarding the provision of the above facilities. I have therefore requested that ISS be informed in writing of same.”Well done to the TDs and Senators of the Women’s caucus for standing up for all women in the Oireachtas – including the contract cleaners, all too often the invisible women.One big Leinster House familyThe Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus has been very busy of late, announcing this week that the Oireachtas Commission and the Finance Committee are supporting its request for the provision of a family room in the Leinster House complex to support the needs of members with young children.Chairwoman Fiona O’Loughlin will also sit on a special group that has been set up to examine and establish family-friendly policies in Leinster House.This throws some light on a cryptic remark by the Ceann Comhairle at the end of the annual debate to mark International Women’s Day.“I hope to be in a position, on behalf of members, to announce an initiative in the next week or two that would demonstrate practical moves this Dáil can take to ensure that in the future we have far more women present in the Dáil and Seanad and a more family-friendly and inclusive – and I mean inclusive in all its manifestations – parliament,” Seán Ó Fearghaíl told the House, without going into more detail.We understand he has set up the forum on a family-friendly and inclusive parliament, “a hugely important initiative for the Houses of the Oireachtas which will herald the beginning of significant and positive changes for all working in our parliamentary community”.The forum has 16 members, drawn from inside and outside the world of politics. Its remit is to propose “practical and achievable recommendations which will lead to a more erse representation in our national parliament, an improved general working environment for all who work in our parliamentary community and for our parliament to be an attractive and rewarding career option for both men and women of all ages”.The group, chaired by former Labour TD Mary Upton, includes Uruemu Adejinmi, a Fine Gael councillor in Longford Alison Cowzer, chairwoman of Women for Election businesswoman Norah Casey Jim Clarken, chief executive of Oxfam Ireland and member of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission barrister Tom Mallon academic Fiona Buckley of UCC TDs Holly Cairns and Neale Richmond and Senators O’Loughlin, Fintan Warfield and Lisa Chambers.The group meets for the first time later this month, and though it can prepare reports on an interim basis, the deadline for its final report is October 31st.The Ceann Comhairle has pledged his full support to seeing the forum’s recommendations implemented in the lifetime of the current Dáil and Seanad.This week, Fine Gaelers were trying to steal a march by trumpeting the good news to local media the night before Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien released details of money for projects in the west. Mayo TDs Alan Dillon and Michael Ring blasted out of the traps with welcome confirmation of an €11 million injection of funds for Castlebar.“This is something I have been working on for the past two years,” Ring told the Connaught .“I have been working with Ministers Darragh O’Brien and Peter Burke at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to secure this funding,” Dillon told the same publication.It’s doubtful they got the news in advance from Fianna Fáil’s O’Brien so they must have done a number on Burke, a Fine Gael junior minister, to get the goods.Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil’s Marc MacSharry got an early steer from the other side and welcomed a “€47,840,000 game-changer for Sligo”. He was cock-a-hoop on Facebook on Thursday night. MacSharry, never one to hide his light under a bushel, declared: “I am delighted to have been able to secure 100 per cent of the funding necessary to secure the future of critical improvements to the Sligo metropolitan area.” He managed this by “working with Minister O’Brien since last summer and in particular in the course of the last six months”.The money is part of the latest round of grants under the Project 2040 national development plan, launched by Fine Gael with huge fanfare in 2018.Back then, MacSharry caused ructions in the Dáil when he accused Fine Gael of holding “a €45,000 Goebbels-style launch” in Sligo while giving little funding to the town. The party was “stealing taxpayers’ money” with “candidate promotion events” in regional newspapers featuring politicians claiming the credit for securing Project 2040 grants for their area.Marc would never do that.Where’s the housing, like?If Darragh O’Brien has been looking a bit shook of late it’s not surprising.He has been persecuted for months by legions of TDs who claim to be working very closely with him while they heroically browbeat grant money out of him for the constituency – at least that’s what they tell the locals.How the Minister managed to get a minute to himself since assuming office is a mystery.And then there is the pasting his affordable homes scheme has been given by the Opposition – along with some backbenchers closer to home.Darragh’s plans to tour the country in triumph, announcing the latest round of Urban Regeneration and Development Fund spending, was scuppered this week following charges that the Malahide-based Minister for Housing was breaking the 5km Covid travel limit for non-essential PR purposes.He is confined to barracks and forced to break the good news in online bulletins and radio interviews while the likes of Simon Coveney are allowed to jet off to Tehran to help resuscitate the Iranian nuclear deal with world powers.And now the Taoiseach, anxious for progress in the provision of affordable homes, is on his case and keeping a very close eye. We hear Micheál Martin keeps repeating the same simple mantra at Darragh during meetings. It’s best imagined in a frustrated Cork accent, with rising inflection:“Where’s the Housing? Where’s the housing, like?”And speaking of Coveney, Cabinet colleagues are to be commended for keeping a straight face during his lengthy report on his UN Security Council trip to Iran last week.The Minister for Foreign Affairs met President Hassan Rouhani and Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif. It seems to have been a worthwhile engagement.Coveney informed the Cabinet he had a 20-minute slot with the Iranians but he ended up talking for three hours.Funnily enough, this snippet of information did not come as a surprise to the rest of the Cabinet, and it soon made its way back to highly amused Fine Gael backbenchers.“It’s the first time I ever felt sympathy for the ayatollahs,” chuckled one.A moment of levity would have been welcome in what must have been a very glum week at Cabinet, with the Government not being able to go abroad for the usual St Patrick’s week jollifications.Stephen Donnelly, to be fair to him, tried to crack a joke in an attempt to lighten the mood.At least the St Patrick’s Day celebrations are still going ahead in Auckland, he remarked, “if anyone wants to send me there!”It went down like a lead balloon. But full marks for trying."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4509819.1615624947!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"italy goes back into lockdown as covid 19 cases rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople crowd Piazza San Callisto, in Rome, Italy, as the region of Lazio enters lockdown due to soaring numbers of coronavirus infections. Photograph: Fabio FrustaciEPAMost of Italy, including its capital Rome and its financial centre Milan, will have curbs on business and movement intensified from Monday as the government ramps up its efforts to stem a steady rise in coronavirus cases.The country will also be placed under a nationwide lockdown over the Easter weekend for the second year running, the government said on Friday.Italy, the first Western country hit hard by the pandemic, saw infections rise by 10 per cent this week compared with the week before, and officials have warned that the situation is deteriorating as new, highly contagious variants gain ground.In recent months the country has calibrated restrictions in its 20 regions according to a four-tier, colour-coded system (white, yellow, orange and red) based on local infection levels which are revised every week.Under an order approved on Friday by health minister Roberto Speranza seven regions have been shifted into the toughest red zones, including Lombardy around Milan, and Lazio around Rome.Three other regions were already red, meaning half the country’s regions and most of its population will be under the most severe restrictions from Monday.In these areas schools and non-essential shops will be closed and Italians will only be allowed to leave their homes for work, health or emergency reasons.“I hope that this will be the last sacrifice asked of our citizens,” said Lombardy President Attilio Fontana. Italy has reported more than 100,000 deaths from the disease since discovering its first cases 13 months ago, the seventh highest toll worldwide.Friday saw another 380 deaths and almost 27,000 new cases.Easter clampdownThe whole country will become a red zone over Easter, from April 3rd-5th, Mario Draghi’s one-month old government ruled.It was not immediately clear how the new decree would affect churchgoers in the Catholic country. However, it was expected to be similar to provisions last Christmas when people were allowed to go to churches in their neighbourhoods.A Vatican source said Pope Francis’ Easter Eve Mass likely would be held a few hours earlier so that faithful could get home in time for Italy’s 10 pm curfew and that the pontiff’s Holy Week activities before Easter would be held in the Vatican with a limited number of participants.Unlike last year, Friday’s decree allows for limited visits to friends and relatives over the Easter holiday - for example to see elderly parents.Apart from Lazio and Lombardy, after the latest shifts in the colour-coded restrictions, the red regions will be Emilia Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Veneto and Piedmont in the north, Marche in the centre and Campania, Puglia and Molise in the south.All the other regions except the island of Sardinia will be orange, limiting movement between towns and restricting bars and restaurants to take-away service only.Sardinia, where infection rates are low, remains a white region with relatively modest curbs on daily life.As Italy tries to accelerate its anti-covid vaccination drive, Draghi said on Friday some 170,000 people per day are currently being inoculated and he aimed to “quickly” triple this number.These efforts got a boost later on Friday when the Italian medicines agency approved the use of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson’s single-dose vaccine, paving the way for the first shots to be delivered in a month.

Photograph: Martin BureauAFP via Getty ImagesThe World Health Organisation called on all countries to drop restrictions on the export of vaccines and vital components, as a rush for Covid-19 jabs puts pressure on global supply and a fresh wave of infections threatens Europe.Several countries around the world have imposed bans or restrictions on exports of doses and key vaccine ingredients amid a scramble for stock, causing logjams in complex international pharmaceutical supply chains that could slow progress to end the pandemic, the global health body warned.“Some countries have imposed legal restrictions on the export of critical supplies. This is putting lives at risk around the world. We call on all countries not to stockpile supplies that are needed urgently to ramp up production of vaccines,” WHO chief\u0026nbspTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press conference.“In a global pandemic no country can go it alone, we are all interdependent,” he added. “We cannot end the pandemic anywhere unless we end it everywhere.”US stockpileA ban on vaccine exports by the United States has led to 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine accumulating in an Ohio facility, and tens of millions more in a separate facility in Baltimore, the New York Times reported. The AstraZeneca vaccine is not yet approved for use in the United States, so cannot be used domestically.“We understand other governments may have reached out to the US government about donation of AstraZeneca doses, and we’ve asked the US government to give thoughtful consideration to these requests,” a spokesman for AstraZeneca said.The European Union is in talks with Washington in a bid to ease supply bottlenecks, a European Commission spokesman said on Friday, after US president Joe Biden said his country would only be prepared to share doses once his own population was served.The EU has exported a million doses to the US and more than 8 million to Britain since February, but has extended until June a requirement for permits for some vaccine exports that saw Italy block a shipment due to Australia last week.Glass vials, plastic components and raw materials used in vaccines are among the components in short supply due to the sudden surge in demand, according to the WHO.\u0026nbspPlanned vaccination campaigns across the EU have been hampered by steep cuts in expected deliveries from AstraZeneca, which is on course to supply only 30 million doses by the end of March rather than the more than 100 million that were initially expected.“I see efforts, but not ‘best efforts’,” European commissioner\u0026nbspThierry Breton wrote on social media, calling on the board of AstraZeneca “to exercise its fiduciary responsibility” to meet the company’s commitments.Third wavesThe shortfalls and uneven vaccination campaigns have piled public pressure on national governments across the bloc, amid concerns a third wave of infections is building in Germany and Italy, which is preparing a strict lockdown that will confine Italians to their homes for the Easter weekend to counter the surge in infections.There were concerns that the speed of vaccine rollout could be slowed as several European countries temporarily paused the use of two batches of AstraZeneca vaccines pending a review of reports of blood clots in patients.The WHO said there is no indication that vaccines caused such conditions, and that a certain number of cases would be expected when the jabs are given to so many people, because such conditions occur in the population.\u0026nbsp“More than 335 million doses have been administered globally so far, and no deaths have have been found to be caused by Covid-19 vaccines,” said Dr\u0026nbspAdhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief. “But at least 2.6 million people have been killed by the virus, and more will continue to die the longer it takes to distribute vaccines as rapidly and as equitably as possible.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4509821.1615626748!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit and covid to feature in st patrick s day biden martin talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Joe Biden will hold a virtual meeting on March 17th to mark St Patrick’s Day with  Taoiseach Micheál Martin.

Photograph: Craig LassigEPAThe city of Minneapolis on Friday agreed to pay $27 million (€22 million) to settle a lawsuit by the family of George Floyd over his death in police custody, a case that stirred national protests over racial injustice and police brutality.Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in May as Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd’s dying pleas for help were captured on widely viewed bystander video, sparking one of the largest protest movements ever seen in the United States.Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Floyd family, said the agreement was the largest pre-trial settlement of a wrongful death lawsuit in US history.The size signifies that a Black person’s death at the hands of police “will no longer be written off as trivial, unimportant or unworthy of consequences,” Crump said at a news conference where he was joined by Floyd’s relatives, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and other officials.Floyd’s family was “pleased that this part of our tragic journey to justice for my brother George is resolved,” his sister Bridgett Floyd said in a statement.“While our hearts are broken, we are comforted in knowing that even in death, George Floyd showed the world how to live,” her statement said.The trial of Mr Chauvin, who was fired by the police force, began earlier this week in Hennepin County’s district court on charges of murder and manslaughter. Mr Chauvin has pleaded not guilty and said he properly followed his police training.Judge Peter Cahill has set aside about three weeks for jury selection in the high-profile case. Five men and two women had been seated as jurors as of Friday afternoon.ReformLast year, Floyd’s relatives sued the city, Mr Chauvin and three other police officers involved in federal court, saying police used excessive force against Floyd in violation of his constitutional rights.Although Frey promised on Friday that the city would be “unrelenting” in reforming its police department, it was not clear if the city was admitting wrongdoing as part of the settlement, and city officials did not immediately respond to queries.“Every American remembers where they were when they first saw it,” Frey said of the video showing Floyd’s death. “Today’s settlement reflects our shared commitment to advancing racial justice.”The settlement includes a $500,000 contribution from Floyd’s family to the community at the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd died, which has been barricaded against police access by residents and is filled with flowers and other tributes to Floyd.Mr Chauvin was helping arrest Floyd on the evening of May 25th, 2020 on suspicion of his using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes at the Cup Foods grocery store at the intersection.The other three officers are due to go on trial later this year on charges of aiding and abetting Mr Chauvin in Floyd’s death, which was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner. The Minneapolis Police Department fired all four officers the day after the deadly arrest. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"world view how andrew cuomo went from covid hero to pariah","story":"Suzanne Lynch on the fall from grace of New York State governor Andrew Cuomo, whose early handling of the pandemic won him praise but is now subject to increasing scrutiny, and whose declining fortunes have been worsened by accusations of sexual harassment.The \u0027 unrivalled foreign affairs coverage, now brought to you in weekly podcast form.

Try it for two weeks and you would be proved wrong, according to the corporation’s recently departed chairman.Sir David Clementi issued the challenge to BBC critics, including “professional detractors” and “Right-wing thinkers”, saying that the majority of them would find they “cannot cope” without access to its television, radio or online services.The basis of his claim is a study conducted by the corporation, in which a group of people who said they would prefer not to pay the licence fee, or to pay less, had their access to the BBC removed.The group was revisited nine days later. According to the broadcaster, two-thirds of the participants had changed their mind and concluded that the licence fee was worth every penny.Sir David’s comments were his parting shot after stepping down as BBC chairman last month. He grouped the BBC with the monarchy and the Armed Forces as one of Britain’s great institutions.“When we run trials where people have had to live for two or three weeks without any BBC services, at the end of it they cannot cope: ‘We don’t know what the weather’s going to be, we missed the 10 O’Clock News, I can’t manage without Match of the Day, how can I possibly cope without watching Strictly on a Saturday evening,’ Sir David said.“Things they took for granted are removed from them, and they realise how valuable the BBC is.“So I would encourage those who think that it’s not worth £3 a week to put themselves through the exclusion. I think that most people would find it very hard to cope without the BBC.”The study, seen by The , was based on a proposal by Prof Patrick Barwise of the London Business School.Seventy households took part from across the UK. Of those, 24 said they would prefer to pay nothing and not receive the BBC 24 said they would only pay less than the licence fee for the current BBC offering and 22 said they would be willing to pay the full licence fee or more.Of the 48 households in the first two categories, 33 had changed their minds in the BBC’s favour by the end of nine days.They reported missing the BBC in their daily routines much more than they had anticipated, feeling that the BBC had unique content that could not be found elsewhere, realising the high quality of BBC programmes and being frustrated by the adverts offered by rivals.The study was carried out in 2015, before Netflix, Amazon and other streaming services had become fixtures in so many British homes.Sir David was speaking at an event for the Royal Society of Medicine, of which he is a former trustee.He claimed that, were the BBC to become a subscription service and hike its prices, he “would be very willing to pay a great deal more than £157 a year, £3 a week, for what I get from the BBC online, on radio and on television. I would pay considerably more. But it wouldn’t be the BBC that you and I know.”Defending the BBC’s place in public life, Sir David said: “There are a number of people who would like to cut down the BBC in size, and we fight back against it.“And we do it because we are, in my view, one of the great national institutions of Britain alongside the National Health Service, alongside the Armed Forces and the monarchy. And we argue that we are one of the few British institutions which resonates around the world.”He added: “A point I would like to make which English politicians don’t spend enough time on: the BBC is one of the very few British organisations which holds the Union together.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"even remainers now admit arrogant eu malign force","story":"George Monbiot is a tricky man to cite. When he isn’t prophesying eco-doom he can be found urging on the downfall of capitalism – which would, of course, bring about a not much better variety of doom. Yet even a radical Leftist like Monbiot can sometimes be onto something. This week’s stopped clock award goes to him because on Thursday he took to social media to show that he had been thinking about the EU a bit. As ever he was confused. But within the confusion lay something important.Monbiot started by saying that we must try to separate out the questions of whether Britain should be in the EU and whether the EU itself is a good thing. Rather bravely (given his tribe), he stated that he had come to the conclusion that the EU is not a good thing, indeed it is a bad thing. Rather illogically, perhaps because he wishes to retain his position as the Cassandra of the hard-Left, he never the less still managed to maintain that Britain should remain within it.Other than pausing to laugh for a moment, I do not want to get stuck on the inconsistencies of the eco-Left, but the first part of this breakthrough still struck me as significant. For Monbiot said that the realisation that the EU is not a good thing had come to him “gradually” and I wonder whether this isn’t something that a large number of people are feeling at the moment. Recent polls suggest so.The areas that Monbiot listed as contributing to his awakening included the EU’s environmental, agricultural and biofuels policies among others. These all happen to be among his personal hang-ups, but the conclusion he came to could have applied to the hang-ups any of us might have. He concluded: “The problem seems to be that governments can hide behind the European Council and European Commission.” And indeed, that is one of the arguments that Eurosceptics have made for decades. It may be that Monbiot is especially irate about the ability of governments to hide behind the European Commission to push through environmental policies they would be unable to defend at home. But the same critique has for years been applied from every other political direction in different policy areas.For example, over the course of decades people mainly on the Right have pointed out that governments hid behind the European infrastructure to avoid having sensible migration policies. They said that their hands were tied – that nothing could be done – because of decisions that had been made at the Brussels level.Similar critiques came on trade policy, tariffs and a whole range of other issues. The point is that few if any of these things could be addressed so long as a national government could claim – rightly or otherwise – that it was Brussels who had the power. The realisation that Brussels had a democratic deficit and that this in turn made national governments as well as the supranational government in Brussels unaccountable should never been a concern solely of the political Left or the political Right. It should have been seen all along as a pan-political problem.Mr Monbiot’s concerns are his usual ones, around the ability of corporate lobbyists and other to quietly push through policies at the EU level that they could not get away with at home. But everybody else could perfectly happily apply the same critique to whatever their particular bugbear is.For instance, if you are especially concerned about the Chinese Communist Party’s ability to get away with genocides, pandemics and much more, you might be concerned at the EU’s ability to be silent on Chinese atrocities while acting beseechingly towards it at a trade level. If you are concerned about Russia policy you may be dismayed at the EU saying one thing about Vladimir Putin while nodding through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline on the other. Closer to home, you might worry about the security of Northern Ireland, but you have to face an EU which simultaneously professes to worry about the issue and violates the sovereignty of the province without democratic recourse or accountability.These things and much more rankle with people depending on their own particular interests. But they are all related in the central issue of a dreadful lack of democratic accountability. A deficit which can be seen at any moment, on any issue.Over recent months, European publics have been treated to the sight of the EU’s vaccine development and procurement policies. It has been a test which the EU has failed appallingly. Franco-German protectionism delayed both the development and purchases of vaccines. Sheer incompetence at the Commission level exacerbated these and many other issues. And now we see an EU where the best-performing members in vaccine rollouts are those – notably Hungary – who have broken away from the EU scheme.People in Brussels should be held to account, but as ever they will not be. Ursula von der Leyen may preside over another tragic farce, but still there will be no alteration in the personnel and no accountability. Because that is how the EU rolls, and it is how it always will roll.Europhiles will say that all that is needed is reform at the EU level. But the people who say this cannot have spent any time studying the EU’s form. If the EU were capable of learning lessons it would learn them. But it hasn’t. It never does.What lessons has it learnt from Brexit – from losing one of the largest contributors to its budget? Nothing. Guy Verhofstadt and the rest of them have spent five years threatening Britain and insulting British voters. But not once have they bothered to wonder what it was that the British public saw that they did not like. Or whether the British public might have been onto something.For their part, the British public have noticed this and much more. One poll this week showed that only 39 per cent of the British public now have any interest in rejoining the EU. That is a decline of 8 per cent in the past few months alone. Perhaps the public can see what Monbiot and others are quietly conceding. Which is that, whatever the EU’s fate, it was never the great moral cause célèbre it was made out to be.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"george floyd family reaches record 27m settlement against city","story":"The family of George Floyd, the black man whose death at the hands of police officers sparked historic racial justice protests across America, has reached a $27 million (£19m) settlement with the City of Minnesota.The settlement is the largest pre-trial settlement in a civil rights wrongful death case in US history, the Floyd family’s lawyers said in a statement.Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer who was filmed kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes until he passed out, is currently on trial facing murder and manslaughter charges in connection with his May 25 death. Three other officers also face charges.The City Council unanimously approved the damages on Friday to settle a wrongful death lawsuit filed last July. The family alleged that police used excessive force against Floyd in violation of his constitutional rights.As part of the settlement agreement, $500,000 is to be used for the benefit of the community on the street where Floyd died, which has now become widely known as George Floyd Square.No amount of money can ever address the intense pain or trauma caused by his death to George Floyd\u0027s family or to the people of our city, Lisa Bender, City Council president, said after the vote. Minneapolis has been fundamentally changed by this time of racial reckoning.Lawyer Ben Crump said it sends a powerful message that black lives do matter and police brutality against people of colour must end.The city needs to exhibit responsible leadership in the face of the horrific tragedy that really was a watershed moment for America, Mr Crump said.The death of 46-year-old Floyd, along with a spring of other police killings of black people that followed, ignited demonstrations against police brutality in states across the country.Answering protesters’ demands, a number of cities have partially defunded their police forces and passed reforms to address inequality.Floyd\u0027s brother, Rodney Floyd, said the agreement was a necessary step for the family to get some closure.George’s legacy for those who loved him will always be his spirit of optimism that things can get better, and we hope this agreement does just that – that it makes things a little better in Minneapolis and holds up a light for communities around the country,” Mr Floyd said in a statement.It is unusual for city officials to settle civil cases before criminal ones have been heard, and some legal experts said the agreement could be damaging to Chavin’s defence.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"haberdashers askes private schools could change name founders","story":"Two of the country’s leading private schools could change their name after discovering that their founder had shares in a slave trading companyHaberdashers’ Aske’s Boys School (Habs) in Elstree and its sister school, the Haberdashers’ Aske’s School for Girls, have written to parents to express their “great sadness” at the revelation of the link to the Royal African Company.The Haberdashers’ Aske’s Federation, a multi-academy trust which runs four secondary and five primary schools in south-east London and Kent, could also have their benefactor removed from their name.All the schools are named after Robert Aske, a merchant and member of the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers’, who in 1689 bequeathed £20,000 in his will to build a hospital and a school.They are the latest educational establishments to consider changing their name following  the revelation that their founder had links to the slave trade.The two private schools announced this week that they have launched a “comprehensive review” of their culture, values and ideals.Simon Cartmell, chairman of the governing body of both the Haberdashers’ Elstree schools, told parents that a further review will be carried out by the Haberdashers’ Company.“The outcome of these reviews, including the future use of the Aske name, will be communicated when conclusions are reached, and decisions made,” he said.He added: “It is clear to us all that the role of the Royal African Company, and the other companies involved in the slave trade, was deplorable and abhorrent.“Such activity sits in stark contrast with the values which underpin the activities and philosophy of the company, its schools and beneficiaries today.”Between 1672 and 1698, the Royal African Company transported around 100,000 enslaved Africans to plantations in the West Indies and America.Its origins date back to King Charles II who encouraged the expansion of the slave trade and granted a charter to a group of men, the Royal Adventurers, who later became the Royal African Company. The charter stated that the Company “had the whole, entire and only trade for buying and selling bartering and exchanging of for or with any Negroes, slaves, goods, wares, merchandise whatsoever”.The first Royal African Company ships sailed from Liverpool and Bristol to the West African coast and, over the next two centuries, both cities grew from the profits of the slave trade.Parents were told that while Aske’s legacy has been “central” to the schools, the past cannot be ignored.With the money from Aske’s charitable donation, a school was originally built in Hoxton, east London to educate “Twenty poore Boyes, who shall be freemens Sonnes”.Later a girls’ school was added and the sites were moved to Hampstead and Acton before settling in Elstree in 1961.In 2005 the Haberdashers’ Federation was set up by the Haberdashers’ Company with Hatcham College and Knights Academy, but has since grown to include other schools across south east London and Kent.Mr Cartmell said: “As hugely multi-cultural schools, we have an unparalleled opportunity to learn from the erse communities of our pupil and parent body to become even more international in our outlook, welcoming of ersity of thought and warmly embracing of the fundamental human values that bind us all, regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, gender and social background.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"manatee graveyard found florida algae bloom cold temperatures","story":"Record numbers of manatees are starving to death in Florida, struggling to find food after an unusually cold winter and an attack of algae bloom.Locals have reported finding “manatee graveyards” in the northern Indian River Lagoon on the Atlantic Coast of Florida, which is a central hub for the marine animals. The number of deaths - 432 - so far this year, is nearly three times the five-year average of 146 deaths between January 1 and March 5, the South Florida SunSentinel newspaper reported, citing figures from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Last year, the state recorded 637 manatee deaths, and in 2019, 607.Experts blame a combination of cold weather, a lack of seagrass for them to eat, and contaminated waterways.Diminishing seagrass levels in the lagoon - due, in large part, to algae blooms - have reduced the amount of food available to the manatees. The manatees have been swimming much further away than usual to find the grass, which is their main source of food. But they are not finding as much, so they return hungry to the warmer water.“A manatee will choose starvation over freezing to death,” said Jaclyn Lopez, Florida director of the Center for Biological Diversity.Environmentalists warn the famine is so bad there are concerns the manatee could be wiped out of the area entirely by the end of the year.Officials said cold stress has accounted for 41 deaths so far. There were 52 cold-stress deaths among manatees in 2020, officials said.As waters heat up through the spring, manatees could swim to other places and forage more easily. Patrick Rose, executive director of the Save the Manatee Club, said any reprieve will be temporary and already worries about next winter.The state, he said, must work on rescue plans and health assessments to be ready. Restoring sea grasses and cutting pollution will take more time.Wildlife officials have reported rescuing 52 manatees through early March, including five in Brevard.“This could even be worse next year,” Mr Rose said. “This is a trend that if it were to continue would be very ominous, ... if this were to happen in multiple places it would be a horrific situation.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"queen ponders rock strewn martian surface virtual conversation","story":"In 1969, the Queen sent a message to the moon, carried by Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. This week, Her Majesty was given a glimpse of the surface of Mars. The verdict? “Rock-strewn.”She also highlighted one of the most pressing questions when planning a trip into outer space – how on Earth would one get home?The Queen, 94, joined scientists and schoolchildren for a virtual conversation to mark British Science Week.She was briefed on the latest updates from the Nasa Mars Perseverance mission by Prof Caroline Smith, a member of the science team working on the mission.Prof Smith explained that the aim was to understand the geology of Mars and look for signs of ancient life, as well as test technology that could pave the way for human exploration.After being shown images taken by the rover on the planet’s surface, the Queen noted: “It’s very rock-strewn isn’t it?”She later added: “It’s fascinating to see the pictures of Mars – it’s unbelievable really to think one can actually see its surface.”The Queen, who took part in the discussion from Windsor Castle, was also told about a meteorite that landed on British soil last Sunday, the first to be found in the UK for 30 years. A family found a 300g fragment of the meteorite, which survived its fiery passage through the Earth’s atmosphere and landed on their driveway in the small Cotswold town of Winchcombe.Prof Smith, professor of earth sciences and principal curator of meteorites at the Natural History Museum, told the monarch it was a “heaven-sent opportunity” for research and described how the pieces were being curated by the museum.“I’m glad it didn’t hit anyone,” she said.The discussion was hosted by space scientist and broadcaster Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock on Wednesday, just a few days after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex made a series of damaging claims about the Royal family in their Oprah Winfrey interview.It came as the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, continued his recovery from a heart procedure at the King Edward VII hospital in London, where he was first admitted on Feb 16.Dr Aderin-Pocock asked the Queen about her meeting with Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin at Buckingham Palace in 1961, soon after his historic space mission. “What was he like?” she asked. “Russian,” came the royal reply, to much laughter. The Queen went on: “He didn’t speak English. But no no, he was fascinating.Dr Aderin-Pocock said it must have been terrifying to be the first human in space, not really knowing what was going to happen.The Queen quipped: Well, yes, and if you could come back again. That\u0027s very important.Her Majesty was presented with a set of Mars Perseverance rover face masks, sent from Nasa headquarters to Windsor Castle. Prof Smith asked that one of the masks be gifted to the Duke of Edinburgh, given his particular interest in space exploration.Dr Aderin-Pocock, said after the video call: When I mentioned Yuri Gagarin to her I couldn\u0027t believe her answer. It was not what I expected, she made us all laugh.She has a wonderful sense of humour and it makes you realise, given the fact that he died in 1968, how long she has been our monarch. She is living history, in fact.In July 1969, the Queen, along with figureheads from 72 other nations, sent a message to the moon. The message, carried on a tiny disc, was microfilmed and deposited on the moon in a metal container.It read: “On behalf of the British people, I salute the skills and courage which have brought man to the moon.

Primary schools are reopening on Monday, followed by cafes with terraces, museums, and small stores on April 5.  It aims to reopen secondary schools, universities, cinemas, theatres and shopping malls on April 19. Restaurants can reopen from the same date but must close earlier. From May 3, restaurants can reopen with no time restrictions and large indoor and outdoor events can be held. Portugal, a nation of just over 10 million people, reported 627 new cases and 18 deaths on Thursday. It receives about two million British holidaymakers a year, and is home to 30,000 Britons.

That was this paper’s front-page headline a year ago today. The speaker was Boris Johnson, promising lockdown. The strap across the top said: “MARKETS MELTDOWN: WORST DAY SINCE 1987”. Matt’s cartoon depicted a man opening an office door in British Airways to tell a colleague: “Good news. We could be a zero carbon business by next week.” This was almost sober fact. (There was some light relief on page three. A hoaxer pretending to be Greta Thunberg had reached Prince Harry on his mobile and duped him into “offering to help rescue imaginary penguins from landlocked Belarus”.)At that moment, I was in the West Indies, making a speech. When we left Britain three days earlier, the mood had been humorous, with gags about elbow-bumping. When we got back, it was fearful. Our first task on reaching Gatwick was to help find scarce Cow \u0026amp Gate First Infant baby milk for our new grandson. My local church recruited me to its swiftly invented system of “phone-buddies” for solitary old people suddenly shielding. In that week, the Government’s chief scientist, Sir Patrick Vallance, declared that 20,000 Covid-19 deaths would be “a good outcome”. Pessimistic, I foolishly thought, but he didn’t know the quarter of it: the total now is 125,000. True, our registration method exaggerates the figures compared with, say, Germany’s, but still…What can we learn looking back a year later? Well, as someone recently said, “recollections may vary”. What follows, therefore, are only my personal thoughts.First, the bad things – beyond the most serious point that so many people everywhere have suffered and died.China. We speak freely of the “Kent”, “Brazilian” and “South African” variants, yet try not to mention the “Chinese” virus that started it all. Yet Chinese it was, though I prefer to focus the blame and call it the Chinese Communist Party virus. We do not know exactly what happened in Wuhan – and the regime will never tell us – but we do know that the CCP did not admit human-to-human transmission of the virus until January 20 2020, too late to contain it. From that suppression of the truth, the world’s subsequent misery has flowed. The CCP has not been punished. Indeed, its cruelty has increased its economic and political power. Its absolute lack of concern for human freedom and welfare has given it an advantage over democratic countries. The party mouthpiece China Daily reports the National People’s Congress meeting this month – “China seeks to end isions, work towards a brighter future” – though the congress rubber-stamped the CCP decision to allow only “patriotic” candidates in Hong Kong elections. The Covid era has exposed the grim fact that many Western elite universities and firms believe this stuff, or let it pass because they want Chinese money or fear Chinese reprisal. Bureaucracy. We clapped for our NHS at first, and naturally wanted to salute doctors, nurses, paramedics. But it was the NHS, as a lumbering, unresponsive system, which caused the panic about beds and thus the sudden extremities of lockdown. It was also the NHS, instinctively hostile to provision outside its control, which left care homes exposed. Politicians of both parties complacently sidestep such problems by promoting NHS worship.    Bureaucracy also means the Civil Service itself. Those bloody battles with Boris Johnson’s then chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, often arose because the Whitehall system, especially the Cabinet Office, could not rise fast to the challenge.  If government in a crisis must, as this Government says, intervene more in citizens’ lives, then it must master delivery. Although it must certainly spend up, it will misdirect resources on a colossal scale if it abandons financial control. Look at Test and Trace. Its call centre was not coordinated with the field workers: 18,000 workers allegedly had a utilisation rate of 1 per cent. This week, the Commons Public Accounts Committee estimated the cost at £37 billion without, it believes, discernible benefit, except to Deloitte.   Loneliness and mental health. Almost every old person I know has deteriorated in the past year in alertness, spirits or physical vigour. The mental pressure on the young is equally great, because they are missing the chance, vital at that age, to establish a stable identity validated by others.Even among people well set up, the strain has shown itself most unexpectedly. Early that March, I saw our dear friend, Rose Paterson, chairman of Aintree Racecourse. In terms of family, popularity and career success, she was one of the most blest people I have known. When we met, she worried that Cheltenham was going ahead and said she would have to cancel the Grand National. Soon afterwards, she contracted Covid. In June, she took her own life.No one factor can explain such an act, but Covid – both socially and as an inidual infection – weakens people, causing other pressures to push them over the edge. When the Queen said, “We’ll meet again”, I suspect she was particularly trying to save such people.  The anger generated on social media – magnifying impossibilist, intolerant clamour by Extinction Rebellion and Black Lives Matter, and this week by the Duchess of Sussex’s unprovable allegation of royal racism – feels like transferred Covid loneliness. If the reality of your life is sitting in a room looking at a screen all day, Twitter may bestow the illusion of power.  Much of the above is gloomy, but in fact my conclusion is otherwise. Collectively, we have withstood our battering. Politically, the noise has been huge, the reality more stable. Despite numerous foul-ups, the Government has spent and borrowed vastly without any collapse in voter or market confidence. It has also achieved – again, messily – the final bit of Brexit. Boris, last year seriously ill with Covid and politically vulnerable, is in charge. At least two astonishing achievements have made a difference. The first is the efficiency by which HMRC, thanks chiefly to Mark Denney, who came from the private sector, made PAYE work backwards and pay out furlough with such speed. The second is the famous work of Kate Bingham’s Vaccine Task Force, which has transformed the prospect of recovery, and shown what an independent nation can do when it concentrates. Across the Channel, the cherished concept of European “solidarity” has proved literally fatal. Above all, I would argue that most people have behaved well. Every day, I am impressed by entrepreneurs and businesses who adapt their work habits and technology in adversity. This week, even the sleepy, unionised Royal Mail reverted to 19th-century levels of effort and decided to start delivering parcels on Sunday. I am daily impressed by volunteers who help the unfortunate by families who share intergenerational burdens and by the general level of politeness. Our own demonstrations by anti-vaxxers or Churchill-haters have been tame and tiny beside the burning barricades in Holland or the US, or vaccine refusal in France or Poland. This is not sheepish deference on our part, but common sense.  “Because half a dozen grasshoppers under a fern make the field ring with their importunate chink, whilst thousands of great cattle, reposed beneath the shadow of the British oak, chew the cud and are silent, pray do not imagine that those who make the noise are the only inhabitants of the field.” Edmund Burke’s celebrated words from 1790 are an even better corrective in the age of social media. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"angela merkels party set heavy defeat bellwether german regional","story":"Germany is set to get its first glimpse of life after Angela Merkel this weekend, and the signs are that it will not be comfortable viewing for her Christian Democrat party (CDU).Growing discontent over the country’s shambolic vaccine roll-out looks set to hit the party hard in key regional elections, and could leave the race to succeed Mrs Merkel as chancellor wide open.Two states are set to elect new regional governments on Sunday and the results will be seen as a bellwether for September’s general election, when Mrs Merkel will step down after 15 years as chancellor.Just a month ago, the CDU appeared to be on a triumphant procession to yet another term in power. It was far ahead of its rivals in the polls and Mrs Merkel, widely praised for her handling of the pandemic, looked set to hand the keys of the chancellery safely to Armin Laschet, the newly elected party leader.All that has unravelled in a matter of weeks, as it became clear Mrs Merkel’s decision to hand control of Germany’s vaccine orders to the European Union has left it lagging far behind the UK and US, with no prospect of catching up before summer.When she told Germans they had another two or three hard months ahead of them this week, it did little to improve the national mood.The CDU has seen its lead in the polls plummet by 6.5 points in just five weeks, and it looks set to suffer salutary defeats at the hands of its two main rivals this weekend.In the crucial southern state of Baden-Württemberg, a historic CDU stronghold, the Green Party has opened up a seemingly unassailable 10-point lead.The western state of Rhineland-Palatinate is closer, but most polls put the centre-Left Social Democrats (SPD) two to three points ahead.There was an air of panic at Adenauer House, the CDU headquarters in Berlin, this week as the party realised it could be about to start a defining election year with two significant defeats.“This general election is wide open. Possibly more so than any previous election. Because the corona crisis is tearing up all political certainties,” Spiegel magazine said this week, before going on to enumerate the government blunders that have thrown it into disarray.“The vaccine was developed in Germany, but not enough doses were ordered. The coronavirus app protects data rather than people.The government reacted too late to the second wave, imposed a month-long half-shutdown without consequence or goal, did nothing to prevent the start of the third wave, ordered rapid tests too late and made unfulfillable promises of reopening.”Last week Spiegel said the only reason it was not calling for Mrs Merkel’s resignation was because “it would plunge Germany into a political crisis in the middle of the pandemic”.The CDU has yet to agree its candidate for chancellor in September. Mr Laschet should be a shoo-in but many in the party are having second thoughts.The trouble is there aren’t many alternatives. Jens Spahn, the health minister, is only just clinging onto his job. The only other contender, Markus Söder, isn’t even a party member — he’s the leader of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the CSU.To cap off a terrible month, the past week has seen three MPs from the CDU and CSU forced to resign over corruption allegations — two of them over accusations they took backhanders for brokering government contacts for facemasks.CDU grandees fear they are facing a repeat of the corruption scandal that brought down Helmut Kohl and ushered in seven years out of power — so much so all the party’s MPs were ordered to sign a declaration they have not taken any backhanders this week.It is against this backdrop that Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate will vote this Sunday. It is hard to overstate the importance of Baden-Württemberg.The home of Mercedes and Porsche, the state is an economic powerhouse. It is also one of the three big states that between them account for more than half of Germany’s population, and a traditional vote bank for the CDU.Sunday’s vote in the state will pit the CDU against its closest rival in September’s elections, the Green Party. The Greens have made dramatic advances in Germany in recent years and at one point appeared to have usurped the SPD as the second major party — and nowhere is as central to that success as Baden-Württemberg.The CDU ruled the state uninterrupted for 58 years until the Greens and the SPD joined forces to oust it in 2011. The ensuing coalition proved so popular the Greens won convincingly in 2016, and they look set to extend their lead on Sunday.The regional Green Party, and in particular its leader, Winfried Kretschmann, have blazed a trail for the idea the Greens can be a responsible party of government, and the party’s success in the state has served as a blueprint for its reinvention on the national stage.Under Mr Kretchsmann the Greens dropped many of their more hardline stances and adopted a pragmatic approach — recent years have seen Mr Kretschmann’s government defending the state’s car industry from attempts by more radical environmentalists to ban older cars from city centres.Meanwhile in the smaller Rhineland-Palatinate the SPD looks to be cementing a recent comeback in the national polls that has seen it neck-and-neck with the Greens.The party saw its vote share drop to a historic low in 2017’s national elections and has been struggling to recover while serving in coalition under Mrs Merkel.But the pandemic has allowed the party to differentiate itself from the CDU. Olaf Scholz, the finance minister and SPD candidate for chancellor in September, has won praise for his economic rescue programme and is widely considered to have had a good pandemic.All the signs are that Mrs Merkel\u0027s fateful decision to hand control of vaccine orders to Brussels may have left her fighting not only for her legacy, but also for her party\u0027s grip on power.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"saturday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Everyone over 40 should be offered their first Covid-19 vaccine by Easter, with a “bumper boost” to supplies allowing the programme to rapidly expand next week, The  can reveal. Stocks are expected to more than double, allowing the NHS to administer up to a million doses a day in coming weeks, government sources said.

YouTuber pranksters fed them a couple of snippets and off they went, dissing Meghan and defending the Palace, one saying “this was an actress giving one of her great performances, from start to finish”, despite not having seen that performance. But amid all the other outrage no one had time to be outraged. I wasn’t surprised, having worked alongside the late James Whitaker, who, whenever a royal story broke, would be inundated with media ­interview requests. They guessed he had nothing new to tell them, but didn’t care, so long as he said nothing in a posh voice. And he was so posh he drank vending machine coffee from a champagne flute. The Royal Family is a fiction, you see. For the majority of Britons it’s their favourite children’s book. A sort of Alice in Windsorland. And for those who hug its battered cover nostalgically to their bosom, it doesn’t have to be true, or real, just reassuring.As in all fiction this story throws up regular baddies – Wallis Simpson, James Hewitt, Paul Burrell and now Meghan Markle. But no royal is allowed to be seen as a baddy. Not eventhey ­associate with paedophiles. A mass grave could be found in Balmoral containing the corpses of babies murdered by a senior royal, who coughed to being an infant serial killer because he was bored with his ­pointless existence. And the majority of Brits would say “yes, but who’ll be head of statewe abolish them  Diane Abbott  No thanks”. The plot twists are a brilliant ­distraction from reality. Right now we’re hearing that post-Brexit trade with the EU is down by a third, low-paid workers who saw us through the pandemic face wage cuts, and the poorest schoolkids will fall a year behind in their education. But what’s that compared to wetting our knickers over a pair of spoiled rich kids pleading they’ve been left destitute in a Calornian mansion with only a multimillion pound inheritance and an in tray full of lucrative media deals to live on  Who cares about record use of foodbanks when they can listen to true patriots like Nigel Farage tell Americans there’s not a scintilla of racism at the top of the British state. That’s despite the current Prime Minister once writing that the Queen “has come to love the Commonwealth, partly because it supplies her with regular cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies”.

Drive on almost any major highway and you will see the verges covered in plastic bottles, crisp wrappers and drink cans. This ugly habit is not just an eyesore and a hazard to other drivers.

What is your view  Have your say in the comments section  Motorists can be fined up to £, for littering but the penalty is rarely enforced. The Highways Agency is clearly not doing its job of keeping verges clean when some of the rubbish found is more than  years old. Drivers are not the only ones who need to clean up their act. It is time the authorities clamped down on this anti-social behaviour. Callous claim  Foodbanks provide an essential service when so many families are struggling to make ends meet. But the fact they exist should be cause of shame for such a wealthy nation. A decent government would have tackled the underlying causes which have obliged so many people to turn to others for support. And a decent MP would realise how insulting it is to charge the taxpayer for a £ parking ticket when visiting his local foodbank. Yet that is what Tory Royston Smith did after meeting volunteers at a foodbank in his Southampton Itchen constituency. Mr Smith, who earns £, a year for consultancy work on top of his MP’s salary of £,, could have made a donation.

Jonathan Cooper, owner of Coopers Chemists in Mr Sunak’s Richmond constituency, said: “Had community pharmacies not worked so hard to keep their doors open during this national crisis, things would have been far worse. “As a result we have incurred massive extra costs and the government needs to cover this as promised. “We want to give a message to Mr Sunak: our door is open – please let us keep it that way by reversing these devastating cuts.”  Anil Sharma, owner of Lords Pharmacy in Newmarket, in Mr Hancock’s constituency, said: “We opened our doors and put ourselves at risk to help people while most other services were shut. “We said no to no one.” He appealed to ministers to give pharmacies a fair deal, adding: “We are not asking to be rewarded more than anyone .”  Some % of independent chemists could be losing money by , according to a study by accountancy firm Ernst  Young in September. It also found that community pharmacists are underfunded by £ million a year.

Royston Smith, the MP for Southampton Itchen, registered a claim to pay for car parking during a food bank visit in November last year, according to official records. The same month local media reported he had visited Southampton’s Kingsland Community Centre food bank. He later said he had thoroughly enjoyed the visit, saying he had been able to watch first-hand how the excellent volunteers are looking after those less fortunate. Labour ’s Andrew Gwynne said: “Food banks are one of the ultimate symbols of a decade of Tory failure.“But it takes a special sort of callousness to visit one then charge taxpayers for your parking. And Dr Alan Whitehead, the Labour MP for neighbouring Southampton Test, said: Whilst itaposs up to MPs what they claim for within the rules, car travel and parking around the constituency isnapost something I currently claim for. And doing so isnapost usually at the forefront of my mind after getting to see the great work that local foodbanks and charities are doing to support residents. Food banks in Southampton reported “unprecedented” demand in the run up to Christmas, as the Covid- led to more hardship than ever. In the South East alone, the Trussell Trust handed out , food parcels between April and September. Kingsland Community Centre, the ‘pop up’ food bank visited by Mr Smith said they had helped  families across four sessions in October. And as many as  new people were queuing up every time they opened their doors. A month before his visit, Mr Smith opposed a bid to force the Government to extend free school meals to be extended until Easter. He said a vote on the issue was a “politically motivated stunt.” On top of his £, salary as an MP, Mr Smith is paid £, a year for  hours work a month of consultancy services for Barker-Mill Estates, a property firm in Southampton. He spent £,. on expenses during the - financial year, including £,. on office running costs in -, £,. on staff wages and £,. on other office expenditures. He spent £,. of his accommodation budget of £,, and a further £,. on travel and subsistence. Yet his total claims were slightly below the national average for MPs expenses of £,. A former Southampton councillor, Mr Smith was elected to the Itchen constituency in . Kim Rose, his Ukip rival in that election, claimed Mr Smith had handed him an envelope marked “confidential” ahead of the election, which contained data to help him target Labour voters. Mr Smith denied passing on private details of voters - and Mr Rose’s claim that he had handed him a “racist leaflet” to use in the campaign. But he admitted giving him information on wards and votes at previous elections that was accessible to any candidate. Police investigated the claims, but no charges were brought. Mr Rose secured more than , votes in the  election, , more than Ukip got in . Mr Smith won by , votes.

Michael Rainsford, , was shot twice through the kitchen window of his family home in a revenge attack that targeted the wrong man.Two brothers, Michael and James Foy, were yesterday handed le sentences for murdering the young man, the Liverpool Echo reported.A poignant statement penned by Michaelaposs dad, Michael Rainsford senior, revealed in harrowing detail the anguish caused by the killing of the talented skateboarder. It was read to a courtroom sat in heartbroken silence before the judge, Justice Dove, said he had no doubt Michaelaposs death was a loss to the community. Mr Rainsfordaposs words, read by prosecutor Henry Riding, highlighted his sonaposs love for his mum and the steps taken to protect her from the agony of seeing the murder scene. This included leading her from the family home blindfolded so she did not have to witness the destruction caused by Michael and James Foy. Michael, like his siblings, was nicknamed a miracle baby by nurses after he was born despite fears health issues suffered by mum, Joanne, would leave her unable to give birth. His dad recalled his sonaposs smile that would light up a room and his caring nature, which attracted lelong friendships and developed further when he started to care for Mrs Rainsford as a teenager. Mr Rainsford wrote: My heart swells when I think of the love, care and devotion Michael showed to his mum. Shy in his early years, Michaelaposs le changed when he picked up a skateboard at the age of seven. His talent was a constant source of pride for his family. Mr Rainsfordaposs statement said: When Michael picked up a skateboard he changed his le.  Michael’s shyness and anxiety slowly ebbed away. Michael became confident and just kept improving his skill every time he went skateboarding. Our holidays were now geared around the skateboard parks all around the UK and any events or skateboard competitions. My shy little boy had grown with his ability and skills, Michael would always be the last person out of the skate park, such was his enthusiasm. I would watch my son on his skateboard and be so proud of how talented he had become. Other skaters would stop and watch him and bang their boards in appreciation of his skills. As he became older, Michaelaposs artistic talent came to the fore in his photography, his dad recalling: I always wondered what had caught his eye. Michael had an eye for capturing the beauty in landscapes, scenery, buildings and people.  But a letime of milestones and pride was ripped from the Rainsford family last year, when he was struck by two bullets fired through his kitchen window. The Foys were convicted of murder over the attack, with James today admitting he was the gunman - having denied involvement in the shooting and putting the victimaposs family through the agony of a trial. Mr Rainsford was with his son at the time. He detailed the horric scenes that followed: Time has stood still for me, my family and Michael’s friends since .pm on Tuesday, April  when evil visited our family home. I was standing right next to my son Michael in our family kitchen. In a split second our family le was broken and changed forever. I witnessed it. The night-time silence was broken by the violence of the two bullets ripping through our kitchen window in our family home and I witnessed my son being shot and murdered. The first bullet hit Michael, the second bullet also hit Michael as he tried to run past where I was standing. The second bullet was either meant for the moving Michael or possibly me as I was standing right where Michael was hit for the second time.  The last time Mrs Rainsford saw Michael alive was when he was being placed in an ambulance outside their Harrington Road home. While he was being taken to hospital, Mr Rainsford said: The last task Josh [Michaelaposs brother] and myself undertook was to guide Michael’s mum and sister down the stairs blindfolded. This was so they did not witness the trauma of seeing Michael’s blood on our family hall floor.The funeral took place at the height of the first coronavirus lockdown, forcing the family to grieve amid stringent restrictions that meant Michaelaposs le could not be celebrated in the manner he deserved.Yet his community still rallied in support, friends, neighbours, fellow skateboarders and Litherland High School teachers lining the route taken by the hearse and applauding in tribute. Of the ongoing impact of his sonaposs death, Mr Rainsford said: “Our family have an ongoing le full of fears, torments and regrets. And magical future family milestones that will never be archived… so many milestones have been stolen, ripped away from Michael in the cruellest, most violent way.  Whatever lay in our family’s collective future or over the horizon will never be ours as all our memories that were yet to be made have been destroyed forever by the senseless, barbaric murder of my son.” The final words read by Mr Riding came from Mrs Rainsford, who touchingly said: “My heart aches every single day for my son. I want him back. I do not understand why he was murdered and taken away from me. “We limp on as a forever broken family, bereft of the warmth, love, care and support Michael gave us, which is now forever gone.” The Foy brothers were found guilty of a murder described by prosecutors as an act of supposed retribution. Just under an hour before the shooting their home on Rossini Street, Seaforth, was bricked.

Campaigners warned it is not only an eyesore and a danger to motorists and road cleaners but also a threat to species such as shrews, voles, wood mice – a vital food source for birds of prey. On Tuesday the Mirror’s environment editor took to the verges of the A on the outskirts of Brighton, on the border between East and West Sussex. Although it passes through some of England’s most scenic landscapes, it is one Britain’s filthiest roads. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section In the space of  minutes, she collected five bin bags full of cans, coffee cups, bottles, sweet and crisp wrappers and cigarette packets. Discarded shoes, polystyrene and plastic sheeting were also found. Residents set up a campaign group two years ago to get authorities to tackle the mess. Until now problems with enforcement have meant few offenders are punished. On motorways, campaigners say it is almost impossible to be fined unless a motorist drops litter in sight of police. Highways England and councils are responsible for cleaning up our main routes but some rubbish found by volunteers is more than  years old due to the dficulty of arranging litter picks.  Next month, Maidstone in Kent will use LitterCam CCTV, a new scheme to fine motorists throwing litter. Penalties will start at £ and rise to £unpaid after  days. The maximum on-the-spot fine in England is £.  LitterCam boss Andrew Kemp also aims to start trials in Wigan, Lancs, and Sheffield, Yorks. Allison Ogden-Newton, head of Keep Britain Tidy, wants littering drivers to get heftier fines and three penalty points. Supporting the trial in Maidstone, she said: “Roadside verges are a haven for wildle but every year millions of shrews, bank voles and wood mice are killed when trapped in drinks bottles.”  Crispin Truman, head of CPRE, the countryside charity, added: “We need a wholesale sht in how packaging is designed, used and recycled to help prevent littering in the first place.” Britain’s dirtiest roadsThe A The A The A The A The AFind out the number of fly-tipping incidents in your area You can seethe number of fly-tipping incidents has been rising in your area using our interactive, along with how that compares to the national picture, and the types of waste being dumped.

But one couple decided to give it a go anyway in the hopes theyaposd save some money, even though they had very little renovation experience between them. And not only did they manage to save thousands - they also added £, onto the value of their property. Abbie Mottershead, , and partner Mark Moloney, , from Staffordshire, purchased a s semi-detached home in June  for £,. They felt the place was extremely tired and needed a modern makeover, so for the past two years, theyaposve been transforming the three-bedroom house. The couple completed the majority of the work by themselves – including levelling the floors, fitting the kitchen, tiling and decorating – and only hired builders for the structural work and an electrician for a new fuse board.Doing it this way meant they were able to keep costs down and Abbie estimates they saved around £, by tiling the floor without any professional help and a further £, on on plumbing costs by plumbing the radiators and taps. They also saved money by doing all the decorating themselves, giving every wall and ceiling a fresh coat of paint. And when it comes to their new kitchen-diner, experts quoted them £, to £, to fit it all - another expense they decided to forgo. In total, the couple have spent £, doing up the property – with all but £, of the money going to the gruelling kitchen renovation, which involved knocking down several walls and five moths of work.  Before the kitchen was touched, they had the house valued at £, – but they now believe the kitchen will add another £, to the property. Speaking to Jam Press, Abbie who works as a childrenaposs nursing sister, said: We were attracted to the house because of its original features, high ceilings and big room sizes, but it was very dated and didn’t suit our needs with a narrow galley kitchen that was poorly designed and impractical. The whole house was very dirty and extremely tired. The goal for the house was to do it up for us to live in for a few years and be able to grow into. We wanted to do it to a high standard and take our time to allow us to save the money we needed for the renovation, doing one room at a time. The house now features three bedrooms, one bathroom, a large kitchen-diner and large living room-music room. The property has been freshly decorated in stylish neutral tones throughout with black finishes.  Abbie continued to say: The hardest part was the kitchen – we had to live in lockdown without it for nearly five months as we did everything we physically could ourselves. Once the builders left, we had to sand down, plaster, paint, level the floor, plumb the radiators and tile sq m worth of kitchen floor with the most dficult pattern I could have chosen. “It took weeks to floor between my shts but it saved us a lot of money. Every tile company we spoke to told us we were brave doing it ourselves as it’s one of the most complicated designs. Towards the end we were struggling as I work -and-a-half-hour shts, so every day off was spent doing DIY and eating nothing but microwave meals.

After speaking to Craig, Kerry and Leee, the -year-old, who lived in Shortferry Caravan Park in Fiskerton, Sheffield, was placed into a coma and died on March .Her daughter Kerry told Yorkshire Live : Sadly today we had to say goodbye to our beautul mum. The immediate family have been preparing for this overnight so had time to grieve privately.“This morning we had the call for her three children to go to the hospital. Unfortunately, her lungs were just too damaged and her body was giving up. “We spent a couple of hours with her telling her how amazing and strong she is. How much she is loved by all her family and friends. “She looked comfortable and beautul, full of colour and just like she was sleeping at home. “We need to focus on the  amazing years mum had, and all the happy times we all shared with her. Keep your family close and cherish every moment.” The devoted mum had been cautious throughout the year-long pandemic, making it harder for her devastated children to comprehend how the virus could take her so cruelly. Susan first started to struggle with her breathing and developed headaches but when she could no longer eat or drink Craig was advised to take her to Northern General Hospital.The -year-old said: “My mum has been so careful throughout the entire pandemic which is why it is so sad for her to get the virus at this point in the pandemic. “I think for many of our friends and family, we had not known of anybody who had become seriously ill through Covid until now, so this has really brought it home for everyone. “When we said goodbye, we were all trying to stay positive and told her it is what her body needs and how much we love her, but we were all devastated.” "},{"url":null,"title":"every adult uk set coronavirus","story":"NewsEvery adult in UK set to get coronavirus vaccine first dose by early JuneAll UK adults could get a first dose weeks earlier than the governments target, as some forecasts estimate that all over-s could get their jab by EastermirrorShareCommentsByTalia ShadwellReporter:,  MAR NewsAll UK adults could be offered their first jab weeks earlier than the official target \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Government hopes to end restrictions by June . It will review restrictions toward the end of the month, with success in part relying on the arrival of new jab supplies from Moderna, Janssen and Novovax in time for the summer. If key tests including a satisfactory level of nationwide immunity to coronavirus are met, society could fully reopen from July, according to the governmentaposs best case scenario plan. However the emergence of mutant iants of the virus have threatened those hopes in recent months. Various strains are being monitored as experts and drugmakers monitor each new iantaposs responsiveness to jabs currently in use, including the Pfizer and Oxford AstraZeneca shots.  And the Prime Minister has admitted the reopening of schools in England on Monday could cause a fresh spike in infection rates. But the transmission rate continues to go down, and daily death and case numbers are falling.

Centuries ago we elevated those humans who were good at war, and today their descendants still rule over us although we now handle the battles ourselves. Andthey want to stay on that blood-stained pedestal, they need to deserve it.  So when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said a member of the Royal Family inquired after their sonaposs skin colour, during debates about whether to give him a title or security, we wonderedthese higher-than-thous were pretty low. When Buckingham Palace didnapost comment for  hours, we became restless. And when a stf-backed Prince William declared we are very much not a racist family yesterday, there was relief he had deigned to mention it, although, to be fair, he didnapost really sell it.Which family was he talking about  His closest living relatives, the Windsors in general, or everyone going back to William the Conqueror, whose DNA is probably, by this point, distributed equally around the British Isles. The trouble with Williamaposs claim is that, whichever family heaposs talking about, there is racism. Quite a lot of it, in fact. And itaposs not out-of-context, reasonable-for-the-time racism. Itaposs eye-poppingly-bad-even-then-racism. Here are just a few examples.  . The time someone senior in Williamaposs immediate family repeatedly asked what colour his nephewaposs skin would be while discussing his security needs, and which he has yet to deny.. The time Prince William allegedly went to a party dressed as a gorilla, but couldnapost be clearly identied behind the mask, so pictures of Harry at the same party dressed as a Nazi caused a scandal instead.. The time his uncle Andrew left then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith slack-jawed at a dinner for the Saudi royals by making racist comments about Arabs that were unbelievable... it involved a comment about camels. . The time that same uncle referred to the n***** in the woodpile to one of David Cameronaposs advisers, who was of Sri Lankan descent.. The time his grannyaposs uncle said Adolf Hitler was not a bad chap and taught three princesses to throw a Nazi salute, in the same year the Reichstag burned down, Hitler had seized power, the Gestapo was created, Dachau was built, and thousands of Britons protested against rabid anti-Semitism and persecution of Jews.. The time that same grannyaposs uncle ignored government advice to visit Nazi Germany, dined with Goering, Goebbels and Hess, take tea with Hitler, and gave a speech saying that what he had seen is a miracle one can only begin to understand it when one realizes that behind it all is one man and one will. - . The time the Queen Mother told a diarist during a drunken lunch beware the Blackamoors, the time she told a journalist she “had some reservations about Jews,” and the time she told a lady-in-waiting that the Africans just don’t know how to govern themselves…what a pity we’re not still looking after them.. The time Princess Michael of Kent wore priceless jewellery depicting an African slave kept as a domestic pet to the wider familyaposs first meeting with Meghan Markle.. The time the same princess told black New Yorkers to go back to the colonies and named two black sheep on her farm Venus and Serena. . The time Queen Victoria became close friends with an Indian Muslim, and her son Edward VII sacked him within hours of her funeral, had him deported, then ordered every record of their relationship to be destroyed.. The time the Royal Family set up the Royal African Company, of which Edward Colston was merely a shareholder and employee, and shipped more African slaves across the Atlantic than anyone .. The time that wealthy slave-owner, banker and MP George Smith became enormously wealthy, his granddaughter married the Earl of Strathmore, and her granddaughter Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon married a prince, became Queen, and on her death left most of her £m estate and fine art to the Royal Family. . The time she also left about £m each to Princes William and Harry, who have, presumably, happily lived off the profits of slavery ever since.Some of these have roots deep in the mists of time. Others are bang-up-to-date. And itaposs worth pointing out that Britain ended the slave trade, too, and freed those brought to its shores by Americans who held on to the nasty habit for decades longer. In  Prince Charles condemned the atrocity of slavery. Prince William has spoken about the horrors of racism in football. Princess Michael of Kent, Prince Harry, even Prince Philip, have apologised for what have become known as gaffes.And at the end of last year, the Historic Royal Palaces announced a review of their buildingsapos and contentsapos links to slavery, which will probably see a lot of heavy annotation in souvenir handbooks rather than having to lose, er, pretty much every palace and private home.

It was when the mum-of-three was standing over her sonaposs body in a street in Harlesden, north west London. Oliver Tetlow, , died after he was shot with a machine gun in a drive-by shooting as he waited outside a shop for his friend on March , . It was a horric case of mistaken identity that claimed Pamelaaposs innocent son - her only son. Tuesday marked the fth anniversary of his death and no one has ever been convicted of his killing. Sadly over those five years Pamela has been diagnosed with stage  breast cancer. Despite surgery and chemotherapy it has spread and she is now battling stage  liver cancer. The -year-old told the Mirror: I know exactly when I developed my cancer - it was when I saw Oliver dead on the street. I stood there and I felt a pain in my breast. That was the cancer. I refuse to let this cancer kill me because I want to get justice for my son. It is now five years since he died and his killers are still walking the streets. Before Pamela was given the devastating news that she had breast cancer, four men had been acquitted in court of killing her son in .  She had been forced to move from her home in Harlesden for own protection and was living in a hotel at the time. I didnapost want to move but since my son had been murdered I was told I must, she said. My son was waiting outside a shop for a friend when he was killed. He usually goes inside the shop andhe had he would still be alive. I have lost my only son and I canapost let this cancer kill me because I need to be alive to see the people who murdered him locked up. Pamela, who has two daughters and two grandchildren, had developed a persistent cough but thought it was a stubborn cold until she saw an advert on TV.  The stress of losing my only son put my body into shock, she said. I had surgery to remove my lymph nodes and had two rounds of chemotherapy but they have had to stop it because I was so stressed about his killers still walking freely in the street. I am taking chemotherapy tablets instead, I also suffer from lupus and have had a stroke so everyday I have to swallow a cocktail of medication to keep me alive. I also have to have an injection in my stomach every four weeks. Doctors had initially told Pamela she was cancer free after they removed her lymph nodes in March  but she said she knew something wasnapost right.  She said: Within weeks I started getting pain in my back, was nauseous and couldnapost stop vomiting so I knew the cancer was still there. I was told it was liver cancer and it was stage four. Doctors removed two tumours from Pamelaaposs liver and she is currently awaiting tests to seethe surgery has been a success. Once I beat this cancer I will concentrate wholly on finding my sonaposs killers, she said. The turmoil of losing her son and fighting cancer has taken a toil on Pamelaaposs mental health which culminated in a failed suicide bid. She said: First one cancer and then another - it just became too much for me.I felt like the devil was trying to stop me from getting justice for my son. I tried counselling but I found it made things worse but I am stronger now and am ready for whatever obstacles are thrown my way. As part of her mission to get justice for her son, Pamela plans to do a series of podcasts about the murder in the hope that witnesses will come forward. She said: My son was completely innocent and killed because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Itaposs now five years and people may be more willing to speak up. After the men were acquitted I was abandoned by the police as I have not heard a thing from them since so it is up to me to make sure people donapost forget about Oliver. I am begging anyone out there who knows who killed my son to speak up. They might have children themselves and need to think how would they feelthey lost the child the way I lost Oliver. Oliver was my only son. I will beat this cancer so I can justice for my only son. I want to be there in court when I see his killers jailed for taking away my boy.

The mum-of-one has shared her top tips on how she saves the huge sum on food every year by scouring Marks and Spencer for yellow sticker items. Kay So, , who lives in London but is originally from the US, was blown away by British food standards when she moved to the UK. In her home country, discounted items translate to damaged or defective products were packing has been dented or broken, and she claims the produce is sometimes even mouldy. Comparatively, the mum says that she was stunned to find heavily discounted food in near perfect condition in Britain – and she now uses a special yellow sticker system to save thousands of pounds on her weekly shop. What do you make of this method  Let us know in the comments section “I was always looking for ways to save and this practice of buying yellow-stickers on perfectly good items was a perfect fit,” Kay, a project manager, said. “It was pure joy to discover that yellow sticker discounts are common practice even in the most elite posh UK grocery stores, like MS and Waitrose. “I purposefully shop at MS for yellow sticker deals because their food is of the highest quality and tends to be way more expensive than other high-street brands like Tesco, Morrisonaposs, or Sainsburyaposs. “Finding and buying a yellow sticker item at MS is even more special because of this. “Itaposs five-star fine-dining on a budget. With Covid- lockdown limiting our choices to hit or miss takeaway, why even bother paying full price for posh groceries to get a five-star foodie experience at-home ”  Kay spends between £ and £ a week on food weekly, which covers all of the meals she, partner Roy , and daughter KP, eight, will consume during that time. She said: “I can get top quality groceries discounted for -% off retail price – especially with posh meats, fresh fish, produce and other food items that can be easily frozen for future use. “I would spend £ a week before but at a lower quality grade grocery store like Tesco or Sainsburyaposs.  “I save about over £+ quid a year buying MS groceries at discount . “In addition, yellow stickers are always a fun surprise. “You never know what you are going to get as a yellow-sticker deal that day you shop.  “It opens your eyes to dferent food and meals to try out or plan throughout the week, solely because the food is discounted.” Some of her greatest bargains to date include a Pork Crackling Leg Joint: Before , Halibut Filletand Frites . Kay recommends shopping at set times during the week when supermarkets often begin slashing prices.  She said: “It depends on the MS location. “The Oxford Street MS Food hall is a goldmine on Saturday afternoons and Monday mornings. “While the Greenwich location is prime for yellow deals at .pm on weekdays.  “Sometimes youaposll see MS employees going yellow sticker shopping themselves or putting items aside for their own shop too.” Since becoming a savvy shopper eight years ago, Kay has even encouraged her husband and family members to get involved. She said: My friends and family love it – especially in the US where this is totally unheard of.  “Often, my husband and I will grab separate trolleys and grab as many yellow sticker items as we can. “At the end of our shop, we compare our finds and see who got the best deals. It becomes a mini supermarket sweep for us.” Kay has been placing the money she saves on her weekly shop into an ISA account.

After one of the most tumultuous weeks of recent royal history, the Queen showed it was business as usual following the fallout from the Oprah Winfrey interview with her grandson Harry and his we Meghan.In a video call with scientists, teachers and schoolchildren to mark British Science Week, the monarch spoke of the importance of technology in keeping people together as well as protecting us from coronavirus.The Queen showed events of the last week - where her family was accused of racism and abandoning Meghan while she was pregnant -  had not knocked her off her stride by cracking a joke when reminiscing about the time she met Yuri Gagarin, the first human to travel out into space. Asked by top British scientist Dr Aderin-Pocock: “Yuri Gagarin, the first human to travel out into space was also born on th March, and I believe ma’am that you met him - What was he like ” What is your view  Have your say in the comments section Her Majesty drew huge laughs from her virtual crowd when she abruptly replied: “Russian!”. The Queen quickly added: “He didn’t speak English. But no no, he was fascinating. “And I suppose, being the first one, it was particularly fascinating.” Prince William on Thursday became the first royal to tackle head on allegations of racism within his family, after his brother claimed a senior royal had questioned how “dark” his further children with Meghan may be, told reporters during a school visit: “We’re very much not a racist family.” The Queen has said they will privately deal with the raft of accusations by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex about their unhappiness during their time in The Firm and is expected to call Harry personally in the coming weeks. In her discussion with teachers and schoolchildren to mark British Science Week, to celebrate the role played in UK society by science, technology, engineering and maths , has highlighted probably the most essential fact when planning a trip into outer space - the importance of ing home. Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a scientist and co-presenter on the BBC’s The Sky At Night programme, said of Gagarin: “It must have been very terrying to be the first one, and not really knowing what was going to happen.”  The Queen quipped: “Well, yes - andyou could come back again. That’s very important.” The -year-old monarch added: “This past year has really driven home the importance of science and technology in all of our lives, from the search for the vaccine, the rollout to the public, to the technology that enables all of us in dferent locations across the UK to gather and speak. STEM is very much a part of our lives.”  During the showcase, Her Majesty was also shown the latest updates from NASA’s Mars Perseverance mission, commenting how Red Planet looked “very rock strewn”. Meanwhile, The Duke of Edinburgh is likely to spend his fourth weekend in hospital as he continues to recover after treatment for a pre-existing heart condition.

Along with many practical considerations, the emotional toll it takes can be overwhelming, creating a sense of grief that can be painful to confront. “Your parents are the people who knew you first, they know your history, they know all the stories about you,” says Claire Hewson. “They love you unconditionally. “When they’re gone, when that’s gone, and they’re not around, it’s a struggle.” Coping can depend on many things. The support you have from those around you, and the plans already laid in place. “I was lucky. My mother was a fantastic organiser,” says Claire, , a call centre manager from London. “She organised her funeral with the local Co-op Funeralcare – her coffin, the car she wanted, and even the flowers she wanted. “All I had to do was the music. Everything  was arranged and paid for. I will always be grateful to my mum for doing that. I wouldn’t have known what to choose.” Coping with loss The last couple of years have been ‘challenging and horrible’ for Claire, who lost her father, Bob, to cancer in May , and her mum, Eileen, who died suddenly in June , whilst in hospital being treated for an ongoing liver issue. “It just felt like the rug had been pulled from underneath me. No-one tells you about death or what it feels like to lose someone. There’s still a stigma when it comes to talking about it.” And yet, while she lost them both within a short period, her experience with each was quite dferent. “Dad was in a hospice so we were going in every day, and the nurses were amazing, telling us what to look out for,” says Claire. “Every day we went in, not knowing ‘will it be today’ ” Claire was still coming to terms with losing her father when her mum died.  “It was dferent dealing with each death. With dad, it’s like I knew he was gone, I saw his body. Mum’s death was sudden, so I never got to say goodbye, and that really does mess with your brain, there’s no finality. Planning ahead The fact that her mum had sorted out her funeral was a blessing. “When my mum’s sister died it was traumatic for everyone trying to arrange the funeral and sort the money out. Mum saw this unfolding and didn’t want that for me. “She said she didn’t want me to have to worry about anything with her funeral. She went to Co-op Funeralcare and had a chat and chose what she wanted. She said they were very pleasant, and it was easy to do. “I will always be grateful to mum for that because I wasn’t in my right mind and I’d urge anybody to do that. It makes that part so much easier for those left behind. All I had to do was phone them up and give them her details and that was it. It took the pressure off, and people don’t always have the money.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sarah everard key questions met","story":"NewsSarah Everard: Key questions as Met probed over handling of indecent exposure claimsThe police watchdog the IOPC is probing what happened after PC Wayne Couzens was accused of indecent exposure at a takeaway three days before the alleged abduction and murder of Sarah EverardmirrorShareByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video family-sarah-everard-pay-tribute-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

It was one of five matters referred to the IOPC, which is carrying out its own probe alongside the Met investigation into Ms Everardaposs disappearance and suspected murder. Serving PC Wayne Couzens, a Met Police officer who protected diplomats and VIPs, was arrested on suspicion of abducting and murdering the -year-old marketing executive. He was also arrested on a separate allegation of indecent exposure after he was allegedly reported over an incident in a south London fast food restaurant on February . Do you know the takeaway where the incident allegedly occurred  Email webnews@mirror.  The alleged incident is said to have occurred three days before Ms Everard went missing while walking from a friendaposs house in Clapham, south London, to her home in Brixton at about .pm on March . It is claimed married dad-of-two Couzens, , finished a six-hour relief sht at the US Embassy in Nine Elms, south London, at pm on the night Ms Everard vanished. She left her friendaposs home at about pm and was last seen on a doorbell camera at about .pm as she walked towards her house in Brixton. It is understood Couzens, part of the Westminster-based Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, was arrested at his home in Deal, Kent, late on Tuesday after ing from work in London.  Murder detectives have been granted more time to quiz Couzens. A woman in her s, who was arrested at the same address in Kent on suspicion of assisting an offender, has been released on bail until mid-April. These are the five matters which have been referred to the police watchdog. Alleged murder of Ms Everard One of the matters relates to the alleged murder of marketing executive Ms Everard, given that the person in custody is a serving police officer. Couzens, a former car mechanic, was an armed member with an elite unit that protects diplomats and VIPs. Police suspect Ms Everard was abducted and murdered by a stranger, and have had Couzens in custody since late Tuesday night. Human remains were found on Wednesday as police searched an abandoned golf and paintball centre near Ashford, Kent, some  miles from where Ms Everard was last seen alive.

Indecent exposure allegation Couzens was accused of exposing himself to a woman at a south London takeaway on February , three days before Ms Everard disappeared. The complaint itself is being investigated because the person accused is a police officer. How police handled that allegation A third matter relates to how two of Couzensapos Met Police colleagues handled the report of the alleged incident. It is said the incident was reported by staff and was captured on CCTV. Despite the allegation of indecent exposure, Couzens continued working until his arrest six days after Ms Everard was alleged abducted.  Staff reported it to police on the night, but it is said no action was taken in connection over the alleged incident, the Sun reported. Had Couzens been arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure, his firearm licence would have been revoked and he would not have been allowed to continue working. Former Met Police detective chief inspector Mick Neville said: He would have been suspended from duty and would have been at home. It is claimed the complaint had not reached command level and his colleagues are unlikely to have been aware of the allegation, the Daily Mail reported. Original reports of disappearance The fourth matter involves the way the Met Police handled the original reports of the disappearance of Ms Everard. She spoke to her boyfriend, Josh Lowth, on the phone shortly before she went missing near Poynders Gardens in Clapham at about .pm on March . Lambeth Police appealed for information from the public at .am on March , tweeting: We are increasingly concerned for the #missing Sarah Everard, , form Brixton. She was last seen on rd March in the area of Clapham Common.  Suspectaposs head injury The IOPC is also investigating how Couzens was injured in a cell at a police station in Wandsworth, where he was being monitored by CCTV. He received immediate first aid when he was found unconscious with a head injury, and taken to hospital for treatment. Couzens has since been discharged and ed to a police station. There is no suggestion anyone  was involved in the incident. What have the watchdog and police said  The IOPC said: The Independent Office for Police Conducthas started an independent investigation into whether politan Police Serviceofficers responded appropriately to a report of indecent exposure. The IOPC’s investigation follows a conduct referral from the MPS in relation to two officers, receivednight, which is linked to four other referrals. They are all connected to the arrest of a serving MPS officer on suspicion of kidnap, murder and a separate allegation of indecent exposure. Our investigation will look at the actions of the MPS after police received a report on  Februarythat a man had exposed himself at a fast food restaurant in South London. we determined that two conduct referrals relating to kidnap murder and indecent exposure allegations against the arrested officer should remain under local investigation by the force. We are still assessing a mandatory referral in relation to the actions of police after they received a report that Sarah Everard was missing. A fth mandatory referral was received from the MPSin relation to police contact with the arrested officer who was treated in hospital after sustaining a head injury while in custody yesterday afternoon. That referral is also being assessed to determine what further action may be required from us. The Met Police said in a statement: Following the arrest of a police officer, the politan Police Servicemade two referrals, one mandatory and one voluntary, to the Independent Office for Police Conduct .

Wind, rain and possibly some hill snow are forecast to fall as temperatures plummet in some regions overnight. The Met Office predicts rain in some parts of England and Scotland today after a spell of cold and frost in the morning. This is expected to clear away eastwards, however forecasters warn that some areas may still experience heavy showers of rain and hail. Later this week, forecasters say the UK will be faced with the unsettled weather, with rain and strong winds continuing to batter the country. Unfortunately for eastern areas of the country, it doesnapost look like weather will be brightening up as the weekend comes to a close, with a subzero Arctic blast heading towards us. Speaking to the Express, Brian Gaze at Weather Outlook warned: It looks like high pressure will build and become established close to the UK next week. Cold Arctic air will be pushing southwards on its eastern flank. That could keep the days chilly in eastern Britain but in the west, it should feel quite pleasant in the afternoon sunshine.  Temperatures locally in Scotland could dip to -C on some nights and below C in large parts of the UK. The latest cold blast comes just days after lorries and cars were swept from roads in gale-force winds. On Thursday, a train was derailed in Tonbridge, Kent as a trampoline was thrown into its path and chewed up under its wheels. The A in Gloucestershire was ground to a halt after a HGV was flung off the road and onto its side by a huge gust, while another lorry was flipped over between Hexham and Corbridge in Northumberland. Headline: Cold, blustery and showery today. Today: Early rain and hill snow over parts of northern England and Scotland clearing away eastwards this morning. Otherwise, another blustery day with a mixture of sunny spells and showers, heavy at times with hail in some places. Feeling quite cold. Tonight: Early evening showers will gradually become confined to parts of northern, western and central UK and clear spells will develop. Another chilly night with a touch of frost for some.

Gaëlle Engel, from France, says she shares aposkidsapos with the theme park attraction. Ms Engel said she has been sexually attracted to objects since her teens, and as an adult she became fascinated with rollercoasters. When she was , the artist found herself developing a strong romantic bond with a German ride. She became fixated on the Sky Scream rollercoaster at Holiday Park in Hassloch, Rhineland-Palatinate, a state in the countryaposs southwest. Her attraction to the Sky Scream is so strong that Gaëlle believes itaposs true love. You could say that Iaposm sexually drawn to rollercoasters but since I met the Sky Scream rollercoaster, I understood what love was, Gaëlle said. “I spend every moment dreaming of a carnal and fusional relationship with it.” Gaëlle admits that when it comes to dating humans, sheaposs never had much luck. However, she has had three serious relationships in the past. The artist said: I will not philosophise on these relationships that ruined my le but it was only suffering, physical and moral. The men I dated had a lot of issues with alcohol and it was a very hard time for me. “But with Sky Scream, I feel completely confident.” Sadly, meeting up with her rollercoaster boyfriend is not an easy task for Gaëlle. And she is also unable to have any kind of sexual relationship with the ride. Instead, the artist collects objects that represent him, as a reminder of their bond.  Some of these items include a photo board of Sky Scream, as well as a pillow printed with a picture of the rollercoaster, which Gaëlle hugs every day. She said: I see him so infrequently. But le made me understand that sex was not a priority in my relationship, especially following the dficulties and trials we encountered in not being able to see each other.  “So I collect the objects that represent him in order to stay connected to him – the love follows me everywhere.” “And then, of course, I have the whole collection of objects that I bought from the theme park.” The artist also creates model works of ious rollercoasters, including her boyfriend, which are on display around her home.

Rather than flagging down a member of staff or writing a strongly-worded letter to the supermarket, they instead decided to handle it with a good old-fashioned passive aggressive note. The cans of paprika crisps, which are shaped perfectly to create a convincing duck mouth, came with a price tag of £, leaving one shopper fuming in the knowledge you can often pick them up for half the price. Using a blank tag just under the display of Pringles, they wrote:  quid - youaposre having a bleedinapos laugh ainapost yer! and simply carrying on with their day. It was spotted by a fellow customer and a picture was shared to Reddit with the caption: The proper British response to Pringles being raised to £ in Sainsburyaposs. People left comments with their own theories, as one said: Pringles must be one of those things that no one ever buys on full price, just like those fancy Naked or Innocent juice drinks outside of meal deals. A second wrote: Most expensive I’ve ever seen them was in a Spar and it was £., I nearly died there and then. A third replied: Itaposs just a rotation of offers in supermarkets, they [are] probably £. in Morrisons or Asda now.

north-east family firm that has spent countless hours revamping its website to boost sales during the pandemic.The team at Huntly Herbs, which offers award-winning organic preserves, was forced to completely restructure the business when the coronavirus outbreak struck. And now, they are selling all their handmade produce through the business# website.Anna Wilson, a partner at Huntly Herbs, says their main mission has been to let all previous customers know that the firm is still in business and the preserves are still available.#We have been making award-winning organic preserves for many years and selling them in farm shops and delis throughout Scotland,# Anna, , added.#Our preserves are still available, just not on the shelves of the shops where our customers are used to buying them.#Our premises is very small, so we have been operating with a greatly reduced workforce since March last year. And, therefore, a reduced output too, which means in order to keep the business going, we have had to switch from wholesaling our preserves through shops, to selling through our own website.#We relaunched our online sales in January this year and have revamped the website. It#s not a direction we had planned to go in, but it#s been interesting to have new challenges # it almost feels like a new job in fact.#It#s still very early days, but so far so good # it#s nice to see orders coming in from all over the country.#Although we enjoyed our delivery rounds to shops and have become good friends with many of our stockists over the years, I am now enjoying having contact with the inidual customers again.#It#s almost like ato the farmers# market days when we felt like we met every single customer.#Huntly Herbs was launched in  and started out mainly growing and selling herb plants for the garden, with the preserves as a side-line to tide the team over in the quiet season.But gradually, the preserves # including jams, jellies, chutneys and relishes # became more popular and eventually took over entirely.Anna said: #We attended farmers# markets and food festivals for many years, and built up a loyal customer base at first in towns around Aberdeenshire and then further afield.#We were lucky that we didn#t have to advertise much and shops came to us asking to stock our range. There aren#t many organic preserve makers in Scotland, so we didn#t have much direct competition in that market.#Our preserves are all genuinely handmade. Our jams and jellies are cooked quickly in small batches to preserve as much of the bright, fruity flavours as we can. And our chutneys are cooked long and slow and allowed to mature before sale so that they develop their full flavour.#Huntly Herbs features on the North East Now website, which pulls together a range of information, directories and blogs aimed at allowing people to find out more about local firms operating throughout the pandemic.The initiative – supported by creative agency Hampton and Aberdeen Journals – launched last June.Anna says the website is #a really good idea, and very timely at the moment#.#It#s great that it covers food and non-food too,# she added.#There are so many listings and directory websites out there, it#s great to have a site which draws it all together in one place.#I don#t think the public always realise that businesses often pay to be listed in directories # so the top  list of carefully chosen coffee shops you are reading might just be the  who paid to be listed.#I like the fact that the North East Now website combines news and blog articles with listings too, so you can read a bit more about the background to some of the stories.#There seems to be a great appetite at the moment for shopping locally and supporting independent businesses # who would have thought it would take a global pandemic to change people#s shopping habits.#Having had a change of direction for the business, we are trying to get the news out there that we#re still producing preserves # just selling them in a dferent way.#Looking ahead, the team and I are looking to keep growing our online sales and develop some new products. vw, px\"  #Now that we are selling directly through our website, I feel that we can produce some small limited-edition or seasonal runs, without feeling obliged to produce enough to supply every shop in the country.#Visit northeastnow.scot to access the hub and find out more.To share your positive business story, email stories@northeastnow.scotFor more information on Huntly Herbs, visit www.huntlyherbsFor as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/02/KFX-250221-01-18_38039468-830x564.jpg ","title":"new guides created for residents in aberdeens a listed high rise flats","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remResidents of eight listed Aberdeen high rises have, for the first time, had it spelled out to them what they now can and cannot do to their own homes.Council officials have developed a #traffic light# system to keep residents within the law after Historic Environment Scotland earlier this year gave its top A-listing to the post-war high-rises in the city centre.It affords the buildings the same protected status as Marischal Square and the Music Hall.Council chiefs are still trying to convince the government#s heritage quango that Gilcomstoun Land, Virginia Court, Marischal Court, Thistle Court, Hutcheon Court, Greig Court, Porthill Court and Seamount Court are not of special architectural or historic importance.Their appeal may, however, be hurt by the recent use of the latter two, in the Gallowgate, in the production of Hollywood Soviet-era film Tetris.A multi-storey car park in West North Street and shops adjacent to the two Gallowgate blocks have also been listed.The council#s guide, yet to be approved for public consultation, confirms predicted dficulties in making homes more energy-efficient and bringing in improvements after the Grenfell Tower tragedy could prove correct.A green light has been given to decorate and modernise homes # including replacing like-for-like windows, external doors, shop fronts, external paint and utilities such as boilers, plumbing and electrics in single properties.But planners are urging advice is taken before work under the amber banner is carried out.That covers removing load-bearing walls, changing the materials or opening mechanisms on windows and exterior doors, insulating homes, fitting access ramps, or upgrading the heating, plumbing or electrics in multiple properties.Caution is also urged before the council replaces, without consent, CCTV cameras, lights, signage and satellite dishes or repaves paths.Furthermore, red-listed works # where listed building consent and planning permission will definitely be required # include inidual satellite dish installation, alterations to balconies, council-led replacement of many windows and doors made from dferent materials, cladding the towers, altering the roof, making #comprehensive# fire safety improvements or demolition.Chief strategic place planning officer Gale Beattie said the document was particularly important, #given the absence of any national guidance on this topic#.The local authority remains the majority owner of the properties in the high rises, though there are owner-occupiers too.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58102819-2-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58102819-2-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58102819-2-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58102819-2-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"pupils at aberdeen school self isolating after a positive covid case detected","story":"Pupils in a class at an Aberdeen school have been told to self-isolate after a positive case of coronavirus was identied.

He hopes for two fully funded sites from bidding port authorities, with Aberdeen seen by some as a frontrunner.Freeports are given special status and can defer paying tax until products are moved on.It’s understood the UK Government wants to keep the “freeports” name to maintain an internationally recognised title. There is also no assurance that as many as two ports will be awarded the status.McKee previously dismissed the UK policy but changed tack with a tailored proposal for Scotland.He wrote to Treasury secretary Steve Barclay this month, asking for assurances “green ports” will have access to the same level of set-up cash as locations already announced in England.McKee wrote: “I welcome that we are agreed on the importance of establishing an approach in Scotland that is fit for purpose.“The Scottish green port model achieves that, with its focus on sustainable, inclusive growth, fair work, and a just transition to net zero emissions, which I know is also a key objective of the UK Government, alongside the core objectives of the UK Government freeport policy around regeneration, innovation and trade.”However, with a reply still yet to be sent, it emerged signicant hurdles are yet to be cleared.A UK Government source said: “We are very pleased the Scottish Government have reversed their initial opposition to the concept of freeports and we want to work with them.#We are currently assessing how their proposals fit with our UK-wide vision for freeports and discussions on that continue between the two governments.#Butwe are not able to reach agreement on the details, we#ve been very clear that the UK Government will press ahead with rolling out the freeports programme to Scotland.#There is a huge amount of interest across Scotland and a massive potential boost to the Scottish economy.#For that reason, we want to move quickly.

draw with Hamilton the Reds did have chances but weren’t able to take them.Too often watching Aberdeen in and around the box the play from the strikers has been reactive rather than proactive in terms of movement and anticipation.We also saw last week chances falling to strikers and they weren’t quite capable to get it under control quickly enough to convert the opportunity.That comes down to confidence and sharpness and the Dons forwards need to keep working on the basics of crossing and finishing regularly in training to build up the confidence so that when a chance comes along in a day they can take it.In my playing career evenI was on a good run of form and scoring regularly I would still do extra work on my finishing to try to ensure I remained sharp and kept a good run going.Scoring goals is the most dficult thing to do, but it’s also the most important thing because goals win games.If any strikers wanted advice or wanted to talk me about their game I’d always be happy to help.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"football cash boost welcomed by red star","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Many TSB customers will have a very long journey to reach their nearest branch. Not everybody can use internet banking.The FCA has already pointed out that during the Covid pandemic it will be hard for banks to reach their customers and engage effectively with them on closure proposals.They also pointed out that customers may not be able to get to a bank to make the necessary preparations before the closure, such as transferring to another bank.Instead of just pointing out these dficulties, the FCA should step in and tell TSB not to go ahead with these closures.Leaving only one TSB branch open in Argyll and Bute is unacceptable.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,After an exceptionally challenging year for older people, Age Scotland is seeking their views in the first comprehensive survey of what it is like to grow older in Scotland.The Big Survey explores all areas of le for older people including health and wellbeing, housing, media representation and the impact of Covid-.We hope to gain a better insight into what older people think, experience and care about.

Indeed, it’s clear that this is the most worrying time in recent history to get a cancer diagnosis.At Macmillan, people are calling our support line every day to tell us about the heightened anxiety, loneliness and distress that they are feeling.On our support line – open seven days a week on     – specially trained nurses, counsellors and financial support advisors are available to help anyone affected by, or worried about, cancer. They can provide comprehensive information and advice, as well as emotional support, to help people with cancer cope with the additional strain of the coronavirus pandemic.We know doctors and nurses are working in unspeakably dficult conditions and are having to make tough decisions every day. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to keep cancer care on track, but we also know that some treatment – operations, for example – are being cancelled or postponed because essential services such as ITU are full of seriously ill people with Covid-.What is absolutely vital is thatthere are changes to treatment plans, these must involve the person living with cancer and be communicated clearly.Although some changes may be needed for treatment plans, this is not the case everywhere or for all treatments or tests. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to make hospitals a safe environment so it’s really important that people with cancer who have been invited for tests or treatment do attend.GPs are openyou are worried about possible cancer symptoms, and screening and other vital tests have resumed in a Covid-safe way. The NHS is still here for you.As well as our support line, comprehensive cancer information and support is also available on www.macmillan.org.uk and our online community is there to provide invaluable emotional and peer support.Gordon McLean, strategic partnership manager in Scotland for Macmillan Cancer SupportSir,Inclusion Scotland, the leading Scottish disabled people’s organisation, believes that planning for the post Covid- Scotland must be about building towards a more inclusive future for disabled people, not back to an old #normal# that excluded a lot of us.As we launch our manesto for the  Scottish Parliament elections, disabled people have told us about the problems they face daily, both before and as a result of Covid-, and what needs to change.Before Covid-, disabled people were already some of the most marginalised and excluded in society.We were more likely to live in poverty, be unemployed or earn less than non-disabled people, and less likely to leave school with qualications, because of the barriers and exclusion we face in our day-to-day lives.The Covid- crisis and responses to it highlighted this, aggravating existing inequalities and generating new ones, and putting the human rights of disabled people at further risk.Going back to the way things were before is not the answer. We don’t want to go back. We want to go forward to a more inclusive future.The manesto # Rights and Renewal # sets out what disabled people told Inclusion Scotland are the most important issues they face and what needs to be done to make a post-pandemic Scotland a better place for disabled people.

It therefore has a special responsibility to do all it can to advance the peace process.So, while calling for an end to violence, it is simultaneously supplying the weapons necessary to prolong the conflict.The shameful neglect of this leadership role and continued licensing of arms to facilitate Saudi-led offensives is unsustainable. It is a stance that leaves the UK increasingly isolated on the global stage, with countries including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands already banning the export of arms to Saudi Arabia.The UK government now faces a choice: to join President Biden and live up to its obligations as UN penholder by ending the UK’s involvement in the Saudi campaign, or to continue to act as both peacekeeper and warmonger, undermining any moral leadership it might claim.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,The SNP has voted to conceal Alex Salmond#s evidence to the parliamentary inquiry.The Scottish Conservatives brought a vote to the Salmond inquiry demanding that Salmond’s evidence, much of which is already in the public domain, be published.This would allow Salmond to give crucial evidence in person about the SNP#s botched handling of this case.

Well done to everyone involved for getting the project to this stage.A broken record we might be, but we make no apology for it.As we have said before, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland have never taken seriously, really seriously, the issue of the Rest and wider Argyll connectivity.

And a constant drain on public money.We need new, fresh thinking on keeping Argyll connected.

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 26 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence. That’s an unnecessary distraction.We need a needle-sharp focus on the recovery without the distraction of another isive referendum.Put recovery first.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the Argyll and Bute LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary election"},{"url":null,"title":"look out for nuthatches in argyll this spring","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

People donrsquot feel heard on issues affecting them.Instead of listening to communities, the current administration makes decisions without putting the needs and views of people first.Itrsquos not good enough, and certainly not what is needed as we look to rebuild from the pandemic.So what began as somewhat of a single issue campaign for me, has grown into something much wider.Our local services have been cut to the bone in recent years. Yes, there are funding challenges for all local authorities, but some of the spending decisions taken by this administration have been woeful.As a result, too many of our roads are not fit for purpose, bus services are under threat, playparks are being closed, recycling services reduced, outdoor spaces are not always maintained and public CCTV systems arenrsquot being funded.We can, and must, do better. This isnrsquot time for tribal party politics. We need a constructive approach that prioritises investment in our public services ensuring better roads, protection of green spaces, more opportunities for active travel, greater support for local businesses and groups and resources for our schools.An approach that always works to ensure that peoplersquos needs and views are at the very heart of decisions affecting our community.I know itrsquos possible and,you put your trust in me, yoursquoll get a councillor who will work tirelessly to make it happen.I promise to be an approachable, accessible, committed and energetic representative who will listen to you and make sure your voice is being heard.Mary Douglas Mary DouglasI have lived on a farm in the ward for over  years.My sons, who live and work in the ward, attended Melrose Primary School, as do two of my grandchildren. I worked for the NHS for most of my career before I retired.I am chair of the Scotland Multiple Sclerosiscouncil, and vice chair of the Borders MS Group. In addition, I am a Walk It leader in Earlston.As a member of the community, contributor to and consumer of council services one of my priorities will be to challenge how and why vital decisions on the use of finance and resource, which affect us all, are made.I, and many people I have spoken to, are concerned about planning processes.Permission is granted for large residential and other developments, often in questionable locations, seemingly without consideration of or investment in, the vital infrastructure required to support them.As is now evident, existing services are already stretched to capacity or facing cutbacks, including the NHS, education, social work, water etc. yet more extensive building is planned in the ward.How, for example, was the land at Melrose Gait considered a suitable location for a large residential development next to the refuse centre, on polluted ground, with an inadequate road to serve it.What consideration was given to the additional demands on the wider range of public services needed to support this scheme and its hundreds of residents.The COVID pandemic has most likely changed the way we live long term, people are now working from home, many permanently.Investment is needed in reliable broadband and mobile phone coverage, particularly in rural areas where signals can be unreliable, to support this new way of working.Existing offices, shops and other buildings that may become empty as a result of the pandemic could be repurposed for residential use, with careful planning.As we move forward the COVID Pandemic has made the most effective use of limited resources even more essential in the short and long term.The Borders must emerge from the pandemic in the strongest possible shape to best support the community and businesses into the future.I have no affiliation to any political party. I have always voted for who I believe can make a dference and contribute to local services.I believe that with my experience in public services and a knowledge of the local community I can help provide a focus for the council on the issues and problems that are faced day to day by the people of the Borders.Jenny Linehan Jenny LinehanMy professional le as both a former procurator fiscal and local solicitor taught me two things: speak plainly and never try to second guess the lives of others.Convincing you of my credentials to be your Scottish Conservative councillor for Leaderdale and Melrose is, therefore, a straightforward proposition for me: I will practice honest politics I will do my best to find out what it is that you most care about and fight your corner.Having lived in the ward for  years, I know how strong and ied our local Bordersrsquo economy is.We are lucky in Leaderdale and Melrose to have some of the best high streets in Scotland but they are under threat.I know the value of small business to our economy whether itrsquos standing up for farmers in Blainslie or supporting hotels in Melrose, to helping new businesses set up in Tweedbank.I will work tirelessly to ensure they receive the support they need.As this goes to print, the Scottish Conservatives have successfully pushed the SNP into a U-turn on extending business rates relief.Thatrsquos the kind of action I want to see from our government, not the dither and delay that wersquove seen from the SNP that threatens livelihoods and stles local enterprise.The challenge isnrsquot just to our economy. COVID- has been tough on all of us.With a vaccine on the way there is light at the end of the tunnel. Our NHS staff at the BGH have been fantastic.I would like to thank them for all the work they are doing to keep Borderers safe and healthy.As the mother of three children, education is another priority for me. Our teachers in the Borders have done an excellent job in dficult circumstances but the reality is they are being let down by the SNP government in Edinburgh, who would rather focus on independence than the future wellbeing of the next generation of Scots.I believe that education should be our priority, not further constitutional ision.I will work with our fantastic Scottish Conservative team on the council to make sure Borders schools get their fair share.Michael Needham Michael NeedhamMichael joined the Scottish Green Party several years ago after reflecting on a future with the impact of climate change, war, nuclear and pollution as key national and global concerns.Locally, however, the immediate priority is helping the Leaderdale and Melrose community to a Green recovery following the impacts of COVID- and considering how the new normal should develop.Scottish Borders Green Party welcomes the climate emergency declaration and Michael would push the local council into changing the words of the announcement into actions.Having studied the local development plan, Michael aims to drive environmental change with new builds utilising low carbon heating systems such as heat pumps, regulation has delayed mandatory use of these systems until  but we should show the carbon zero ambitions in the Borders together with improved local authority provision of electric vehicle charging facilities.With a greater gap between income levels and rental   house prices and a lack of affordable housing within the Leaderdale and Melrose areas, itrsquos vital that any new developments at least complies with the minimum provisions agreed for low cost housing.Michael would also aim to protect and improve local bus and train services throughout the Borders and ensure that the operators continue to work towards restoring timetables following the restrictions.The Scottish Green Party was responsible for changes within the Scottish Government that will mean under s will soon get free bus travel throughout Scotland.Other key local issues are: saving the high street with a shop local campaign, unemployment, which has always been more challenging in the Borders, together with people typically earning lower wages.Michael is from Galashiels, has lived most of his le in the Borders and works in the contact centre industry he is currently working from home and is acting co-lead GMB union rep and has been involved in national campaigning to make firing people to re-hire on lesser terms and conditions illegal.Michael is a disability champion within the global organisation he works for and is involved in union policy change and disability discrimination.John Paton Day John Paton DayLeaderdale  Melrose is the jewel in the crown of the Scottish Borders.Then, I may be biased, having lived, worked and raised my family here for the last  years.I have dedicated myself to standing up for numerous grassroots and vital voluntary causes that are close to the hearts of so many in our community.From co-founding the lsquoBorders Small Schools Networkrsquo to chairing Earlston Community Council, I am proud to serve those who call Leaderdale  Melrose home.Itrsquos important that our representatives within Scottish Borders Council understand the needs of local people.It is for this reason that I highlight the following three issues, on which I am seeking your vote next month.The first issue is roads.After yet another cold and wet winter our local roads require urgent repair and improvement ndash and this is not just dealing with potholes: we need to ensure all those using those roads can do so in the safest manner possible.Next is rural housing. As a committee member of Scottish Borders Housing Association, I am ready and able to hold to account those in charge of building affordable housing.I will call for increased investment to speed up the delivery of warmer, safer homes for all.And finally, recycling.Itrsquos vital we are able to do our bit to protect the environment and leave our Borders beautul for the next generation to enjoy however, many of our smaller villages are currently without facilities that make everyday recycling accessible.Itrsquos for this reason I will be seeking greater provision of recycling points that are accessible to all our towns and villages.Last, but by no means least, many of you will be familiar with the hard work and dedication of our much-missed colleague, Councillor Kevin Drum.When Kevin passed away last March after a short illness his loss was felt by so many in our community.Retaining this seat for the SNP will enable me to pick up where Kevin left off continuing his legacy of putting others first and helping to build a better Borders for all.Scott Redpath Scott RedpathThe impact of COVID over the last year has shown us the importance of working together and proved beyond doubt that it is through collective action, rather than constitutional arguments, that we can best face up to the great challenges of our times.I am neither unionist nor nationalist but a socialist and Irsquom standing for Labour in this election because I believe that jobs, wages and public services are key to our recovery from the pandemic.Born and bred in the Borders Irsquove spent most of the last two decades as a shopworker, serving my community, getting to know the problems and challenges people face.Irsquom an experienced campaigner and an active member of the shopworkers union USDAW.I successfully campaigned for changes in the law to protect my colleagues from abuse and tackle the bad practices of employers who, sadly, too often sought to cut corners when it came to their safety and pay.As a councillor I would campaign for a rise in the minimum wage to pound and would push to ensure that the key workers who have stepped up so magnicently during COVID are recognised not just by rainbows and rounds of applause but by better working conditions and proper pay.I would bring an independence of mind to the council chamber, campaigning for action to tackle the attainment gap in our local schools, ensuring people have the quality public services they deserve, pushing for a publicly owned local bus system that better meets our needs properly connecting our towns and villages and ensure that funding provided to SBC to assist people during and after the pandemic gets to those who need it most quickly and without red tape holding them back.On March  vote Labour to help achieve these goals ndash together.Karen Wilks Karen WilksI am a volunteer support officer and session supervisor at Musselburgh Citizenrsquos Advice Bureau.Previously I have worked with Domestic Abuse Advocacy Service in the Scottish Borders, Edinburgh Domestic Abuse Court Service and Victim Support Scotland ndash providing advocacy, information, emotional and practical support to victims of crime within the community and within the Scottish Criminal Justice System.From living in and around Earlston for most of my le and being a parent of a young person in secondary school, I have the same concerns as every other parent has in relation to education, especially given this past year and the dficulties our young people have had to face due to the pandemic.Currently I manage the general advice service within Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau. I have witnessed, as have other bureaux, a vast increase in the need for support due to COVID-.People being placed on furlough, loss of employment, businesses closing, requirement to self-isolate, reduced incomes, increase in demand for foodbanks and energy support.I have the knowledge and understanding in relation to these issues and many more that are prevalent within our community.My current and previous roles have taught me how to question, challenge those in positions of power on behalf of people in crisis and in vulnerable situations.My focus has been to get their voice heard, get them the information required, aid them to empowerment all working towards as positive an outcome as possible.I can and will draw on those skills, experience and dogeared determination, enabling me to confidently support local business, community groups, the inidual, transport infrastructure, local economy and health in our recovery and continued growth from COVID-.ExtrainformationPolling stations

numbers. Areas such as Glasgow City, North Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian could move to Level , based on cases.Unlike the previous levels system, the Scottish Government is taking a harsher approach to deciding the levels.They are taking point from the World Health Organisation, and are rebasing the indicators that are used to guide decisions on the allocation of levels on the recommendations made by WHO.It is hoped these indicators will be set out fully in the middle of this month.The framework reads: \"Although there are some dferences, this aligns broadly with our levels approach and indicates that we should lower or tighten some of the thresholds associated with each of our five levels.\"If following the WHO recommendations, levels will be based on cases per , population and the percentage of positive tests as core indicators, meaning the data in the above table details what we could expect, based on the cases per k.The Scottish Government also say they will continue to look at forecasts of hospital admissions and ICU occupancy, as well as patterns of infection in older people andthe ability of the NHS to resume paused serviced.According to their Strategic Framework update, the plan is to progress through the proposed easings for Level , \"at a pace that the data indicate is safe\", and from there to allocate protection levels again in accordance with geographical epidemiological data.They will look to the criteria set out by the World Health Organisation, and use it to assess whether it is safe to proceed with each new set of easings.However, they will also be adding one extra condition that they say \"must be met\" in addition to the six WHO criteria for easing lockdown.

I wish Jimmy a really happy retirement, and would like to thank him for all he has done over the years.I went back to work at MAKI Pups, the new outdoor nursery based in Lochgilphead, last week but I intend to continue with my litter-picking at weekends when I can. I won#t stop now I#ve started.If anyone wishes to help in any way, please phone me on  .There was an interesting letter from Ron Wilson in the February  edition of the Courier which, as with any politician#s pronouncements, was laced with spin, hyperbole or half truths and consequently tells only half the story.Regarding vaccines, nobody, except the SNP, talks about Westminster#s charity. It is my understanding that Great Britain and Northern Ireland are part of the UK and independently opted not to use the EU system and purchased vaccines for itself.This elicited the usual howls of derision by SNP politicians along the lines of: #This idiotic refusal is all about Brexit and nothing to do with the pandemic and will cost lives,# and others of a similar vein.The inept EU vaccine-purchasing system has been and still is chaotic. France, at the time of writing, with a population of  million, has vaccinated . million. Pro rata, under the EU system, Scotland would probably have received , as opposed to the . million currently vaccinated.The electorate keep hearing: #As an independent member of the EU#. This is possibly an SNP aspiration but I think there are several hurdles to an independent Scotland joining the EU.What currency would be used, what proposals are there to meet the EU fiscal rules for membership in respect of the annual GDP deficit which is currently running at . per cent, well above the three per cent required The last figures available for government debt to GDP of  per cent is well above the  per cent required. Then there is the strong possibility of a Spanish veto or perhaps they are proposing throwing Clara Ponsatí to the wolves and saying: #We are sorry we backed the Catalans in order to curry favour with Madrid.#Regarding the EU solidarity stimulus plan, I would hope that it was considerably greater than the UK there are  member countries. I understand that it is € billion, spread over three years, and the grants and loans are subject to strict requirements. I notice that you do not mention £. billion to date allocated through the Barnett formula which is separate from the money. I do not know how much, currently paid to Kate Forbes MSP, cabinet secretary for finance#s department in the furlough scheme.Regarding the comments relating to Brexiteers and leaving the EU as #Johnson#s folly#, it has obviously escaped Mr Wilson#s notice that leaving the EU, liking the decision or not, was a democratic one by the UK electorate and, unlike the EU or the SNP, in our constitution we do not send the electorate back to vote again until such time that they #vote correctly#.Banking crash  May I remind Mr Wilson that it was the Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland which were the main protagonists in the UK which had a serious impact on our economy. Mr Wilson#s rather emotive #gimcrack imperial fantasies# could well have applied to the antics of the two Scottish banks# boards of directors.I am not particularly an avid supporter of politicians per se but the current SNP government by any yardstick is a really appalling administration with a record of declining education, health care and financial mismanagement, just to mention three areas.Leaving aside the first two, what should cause concern is the eye-watering amounts of taxpayers# money wasted. The new Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh is at least £ million over budget and still not fully operative Ferguson Shipyard ferry project, currently £ million and no ferries, projected final cost an additional £ million and no firm delivery date other assorted projects like the BiFab yards, £ million, two of which have been bought by a UK company for £, Prestwick Airport, there is a bit of #smoke and mirrors# but somewhere around £ million is close.A bit closer to home, the Glen Croe problem up to the Rest and Be Thankful, which has been ongoing since  and is regularly subject to closure, has had at least £ million spent on it to date. It is of no surprise that Jim McColl said that #everything the SNP touch is a mess#. Added to that, we have the current internecine Salmond Sturgeon Murrell case ongoing currently swallowed up in excess of £, of taxpayers# money and rising.Mr Wilson is perfectly entitled to his point of view, as I am to mine, but as I said in my opening paragraph, and this applies to politicians of all political persuasions, please present the full narrative not some unsubstantiated wish list.The neglect of the A is a disgrace. It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago, we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said it would solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.  We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions."},{"url":null,"title":"postponed new year competition played in brutal conditions","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But, we live in a world which increasingly believes that to disagree is to hate.Could it be that to disagree might in some circumstances actually be the manestation of love If a child searching for meaning and identity and love has chosen a path of destruction through heroin, for example, would a parent be loving to blindly affirm him Could disagreement be love The apostle Paul wrote this to Timothy, a young pastor: #And the Lord#s servant must not be quarrelsome, but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth.#Timothy was to be a model of the Lord Jesus, the most loving man who ever lived and yet the one who disagrees with everyone. Disagrees  Really  Yes, Jesus# first word to the world in the gospel of Matthew is, #repent#, that is, #you are heading the wrong way, turn from sin to God.#Jesus isn’t addressing a particular section of society, or a particular behaviour, he is not directing his gaze at #everyone except me#. This is the most loving call in the world to everyone everywhere. And it#s good news because it comes from a saviour who paid for sin and who offers us the power to change.#I have come,# said Jesus, #that they may have le and have it in abundance.#His invitation  Come, find out how to live and how to love."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltowns colin joins team scotland staff","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Ed called a meeting at his home on March   to discuss the matter, with  settlers in attendance.A petition was drawn up and signed, asking for the creation of a post office with Ed as postmaster.

If we want children and families to come to the area we need to keep the school open,# he said.Argyll and Bute Council met yesterdaywhen members were asked to agree to hold informal pre-consultation meetings with representatives from  communities that may be affected by the school estate review.The council was also asked to agree to review the school estate #on an ongoing basis# and reducing the future scale of any changes which would be considered at any one time.Now the proposal is for Rhunahaorine to go into Glenbarr and Clachan and Skipness to go to Tarbert. Saint Kieran#s also goes into Castlehill in Campbeltown this is a paper exercise as Saint Kieran#s no longer has pupils and is mothballed.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGONew Post OfficeCampbeltown’s Meadows scheme is to get its own post office in the early summer.Post Office Counters plans to open a community post office in Ralston Road in late May or early June.Post Office Counters has already secured premises for the office which will be open for around  hours a week but the chairwoman of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancy Smith, said she would prefer a new post office in the town centre.Since the main post office moved from Longrow to the Co-op supermarket last summer, the town centre has not had a post office.Mrs Smith said: #I#m pleased that there is going to be another outlet for people, but unless people have got a car it#s only going to be suitable for people in the Meadows scheme.#She added: #The community council has always pushed for a post office in the centre of the town.

This is in contradiction to what is surely the council#s main aim when setting the budget # saving money where possible.Despite many of KRL#s staff having barriers to working, they do an exemplary job and are happy in their workplace # something which is evident from a visit to the recycling centre. The fact that some of them may lose the jobs they enjoy and do so well as a result of this decision is shocking and heart-breaking.Campbeltown has seen record levels of redundancies over the last couple of years, with more than  lay-offs at CS Wind and Campbeltown Creamery alone, never mind the many people who have since lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. To potentially add to this level of unemployment for no apparent good reason is baffling.KRL not only provides an efficient and cost effective service but worthwhile jobs to people who may otherwise struggle to find employment and are no doubt very concerned about their futures right now.This decision should be reconsidered."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I immediately hung up # wondering which of my frailties had been discovered # and phoned  which tells you the last number that called.I twice noted the number given by  and ventured to phone it. On dialling this number, the phone company advised me that there was #no such number#.Over a week, adopting identical procedures, five dferent #no such numbers# were found. The job of answering morning calls was then delegated to the message answering machine and only once did it receive a call which was terminated speedily by the caller without a message.Is there a flaw in our phone companies# systems with consequent loss of income  If this flaw could be eradicated, phone scammers might be less numerous and consequently afford a little more protection for the vulnerable.Going by theof John Newall#s reply to my letter on England#s disastrous Brexit, forced upon Scotland against our democratic wishes, I had expected better than the mishmash of worn out tropes and John Bull exceptionalism trotted out by Mr Newall.Mr Newall makes great play of the successful roll-out of the Covid vaccine in Scotland and the UK. He is absolutely right, it has been a fantastic achievement, but to then go on to use this success to denigrate the EU#s vaccine programme is crass and over simplistic.Our success is an illusion until both doses of vaccine are administered, crowing about vaccines when only . per cent of the UK population has had the vital second jag, compared, for example, to . per cent in Denmark, is both presumptuous and inappropriate.Mr Newall goes on to assert that Scotland has a deficit that will prevent Scotland re-entering the EU, without of course mentioning the elephant in the room, the UK#s ruinous £ trillion # and increasing # debt. Unionists need to get their own house in order before lecturing anyone .Of course, legally, Scotland has no #deficit# or #debt#. How can a country with virtually no borrowing ability have a debt  What Scotland does have is a notional #debt#, the price of Westminster failure within the UK, where spending outwith Scotland#s control is assigned to Scotland, such as Trident, HS and London’s Crossrail. Spending that Scots taxpayers cough up for.Indeed,Courier readers start counting now at the rate of one a second, they#ll reach the number of pounds spent on Boris Johnson’s failed Track and Trace system at about .am on April  in the year . Readers may well wonder where the money went and why this is being loaded on to Scotland#s ledger.Straight from the #Better Together# playbook, Mr Newall brings up the hoary old #Spanish veto# myth. The truth is that Spain has no issue with an independent Scotland in the EU so long as this is within the framework of the UK constitution # which it is.Unlike Catalonia#s predicament, Scotland is not a #region# of the UK, there is no constitutional prohibition on independence votes or indeed of Scotland abrogating the  Treaty of Union with England.This is why successive prime ministers, from Margaret Thatcher to David Cameron, have repeatedly recognised the right of the Scottish people to independence # and why Boris Johnson#s oafish #No# will run into the sand.Mr Newall and I will never agree but that is the essence of democracy, and the right to choose in a free country.Scotland can either remain, semi-detached and impotent, as part of an increasingly insular Little Englander Tory Britain, bringing in its wake further austerity and diminished le chances for our young people, or Scots can vote for independence, just like our neighbours.Yes, there will be dficult choices, yes, there will be mistakes, but they will be our decisions to get right as we work for the prosperous, open and internationalist country that is within our grasp.I am delighted that our council will be investing nearly £. million to help keep Argyll and Bute going and growing.After relentless campaigning from myself and others it#s great to see, at long last, some substantial investment in our crumbling infrastructure.Building on investments made in previous years, an additional £. million will be invested to drive forward improvements and repairs to Argyll and Bute#s network of roads in rural, remote, island and urban communities, bringing the overall roads reconstruction budget to £ million for  .We are also investing more in active travel, in line with the council#s agreed priorities. This includes a further £, in enhancing and improving footpaths. This investment complements the current allocation of £, in green transport and travel.This recent Covid pandemic has highlighted more than ever the need to tackle our urban-rural ide. Even now, many of my constituents are paying primum prices for snail#s pace broadband speeds.That#s why £, is being invested in a Tackling Digital Exclusion Top-Up Fund # to support people, businesses and communities to access improved digital connections for social and commercial opportunities supporting communities and in some cases iniduals that are missing out on national programmes due to logistics and economies of scale.While this budget is not perfect and there will be challenges ahead as we start to recover from the ongoing global pandemic this is a massive step in the correct direction.Now my constituents across the Kintyre and the Islands ward will quite rightly want to see action, not more talking.So that means more help for our small businesses, improving our digital connectivity and substantial improvements to our roads which in so many areas are sadly approaching the point of no .Six years ago, I had a sudden and le-changing stroke. I’m not alone in this: stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and around . million survivors are living with its devastating effects.Despite this, research into stroke is severely underfunded. Just one per cent of the total UK public and third sector health research spend goes towards stroke research.The Stroke Association has launched a unique opportunity for stroke survivors and those who care for stroke survivors to have our say on the future of stroke research. Partnered with the James Lind Alliance, the charity will find out what matters to us most so research can make the biggest dference to our lives.With such limited funds for stroke research, worsened by the Covid- pandemic, it#s vital that we come together and make our voices heard.If you#re a stroke survivor, or you care for or work with someone affected by stroke, join me and speak up for stroke.Visit www.stroke.org.uk jla by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There are some who will witness to the fact He speaks out loud to them and others who catch directions in the circumstances of everyday le, how doors open and close, through the advice of good friends and by the reaction of conscience to intentions.Those who read the Bible regularly and systematically, as opposed to opening it at random and sticking in a pin, are often amazed at how the passage for the day addresses the problems and circumstances of that day # and draw from that what they believe God is telling them.In I Kings chapter , we read of the Prophet Elijah feeling overwhelmed by the attacks of his enemies and the declaration of Queen Jezebel of a hunt to kill him. In the midst of his trauma, the word of the Lord comes to him, not in a great wind nor in an earthquake nor in a fire but in a low whisper.With all that has been going on around us over the past year, we too may be feeling overwhelmed.

All of this is excellent news, and provides strong grounds for hope, but that hope must also be balanced by caution.#The changes, while modest, are important, and are designed to help people#s health and well-being by enabling group exercise and allowing more social interaction.

They are asking meit will take residents getting hurt before action is taken.#At the council budget we, as a council, put huge additional resources into infrastructure, in particular roads spending, so now there should be no more excuses and delays.#Skipness residents must be listened to and fit-for-purpose long-term work must be done.##The B is in dire condition and is causing increasing concern for residents and delivery services,# said Councillor Anne Horn.#I raised this issue again at MAKI area committee and the head of service advised the meeting that the repairs are prioritised for the next financial year. He also advised that residents will be notied of plans and progress for the roadworks.#This repair requires urgency and I will be urging officers to expedite the work without delay.#WEST KINTYRE:Applications for grants from this year#s first round of funding from the West Kintyre Community Council Wind Farm Trust are currently being accepted.Grants may be available for capital or revenue funding to support projects, groups, halls, charities and churches within the West Kintyre Community Council area, ranging from Whitehouse in the north to Kilkenzie in the south.Advice, details and application forms are available from convener Margaret Pratt via email at margaretpratt@btinternetThe closing date for receipt of applications is Wednesday March , and the disbursement meeting will take place virtually on Monday April .CARRADALE:Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis seeking Kintyre residents# views on the planned replacement of a submarine electricity cable between Carradale and Arran.The energy company is planning to install a  kilovoltcable which will run from Port na Cuile, Carradale to Balliekine on Arran.It comes after a routine inspection in August  of the two kV submarine cables providing electricity to Arran revealed the north cable, which runs from Port Crannaich in Carradale to Balliekine, was in poor condition with signicant damage to the protective armour # probably caused by contact with rocks.The armour of the cable to the south was intact so no further action was required.Following an assessment by engineers, SSEN decided to replace the north cable because a repair would be challenging and more costly due to its deep-water location and the extent of the damage observed.In order to gather opinions and answer any questions about its replacement plans, SSEN#s submarine cable team will be holding a pre-application consultation in the form of a series of four hourly online sessions between pm and pm on Thursday March .To register for the event, email submarinecables@sseAs well as seeking views on the project, SSEN is also looking for comments and opinions on its  #  investment programme."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 12 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Minutes later, the MFV steamed away from the village, minus the men.A Land Rover had earlier searched a wide area in vain for them.On Tuesday morning, three Marines called at the village bar and asked for sandwiches.

Mr Wilson is trying to muddy the waters there.Whilst Mr Wilson is correct that Scotland cannot have debt , Scotland does have deficit, and the reason we know this is because the SNP-run Scottish Government tells us so in the annual Government Revenue and Expenditure, Scotlandbut Mr Wilson contradicts himself by going on to say that Scotland has a #notional debt# . Scotland has no debt. Scotland cannot have debt. Mr Wilson needs to realise that debt and deficit are two dferent things.With regard to HS, yes, Scotland pays a two per cent share of the total cost but will receive approximately . per cent back in Barnett consequentials. THAT is a very good deal for Scotland. London#s Crossrail  Not a single penny for that will be paid for by Scotland.Mr Wilson goes on to say that there is no #prohibition on independence votes#. Another error from him. Section  of The Scotland Act , the act which allowed us to have a devolved assembly and to which the then Scottish Office signed up, lays down the exact process required. We need permission from HMGov.Oh, and the notion that Scotland can abrogate the Treaty Of Union is also wrong. Whilst Westminster is a parliament of equals, it cannot of itself dissolve the Treaty of Union of which it was not itself a progenitor. That is the prerogative of the suspended national parliaments of England and Scotland, which will require to be recalled from suspension #in abeyance ad interim# where they legitimately reside at the present time. Only the recalled national parliaments of Scotland and England may re-negotiate the  Treaty of Union.I would take this opportunity to remind Mr Wilson of two things: we had a referendum in  and voted to stay in the UK, and he should really learn to live with that and in no election ever, General or Scottish, has the SNP garnered more than  per cent of the vote.The decision by Argyll and Bute Council to stop funding Kintyre Recycling Limited is perverse to say the least.No thought seems to have been given to the level and cost of the future support for the employees who will be thrown on the scrap-heap. Will that go to the social work department and will they get the same level of support as they do now No thought seems to have been given to the effect on the mental health of the employees # what support will be available and what budget will it come from How can the expenditure of a quarter of a million pounds be justied when the council is struggling for money and how long will it take to save this amount compared with the partial funding for Kintyre Recycling Limited It is shameful that only two of our local councillors are against vulnerable people being thrown on the scrap-heap when all three should be supporting their constituents.I am pleased to support the new business group set up to campaign for a quick and permanent solution for the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A.It’s now seven months since the landslide closed the A last summer. That should have been a wake-up call for the SNP Government, but all we#ve had since then is a failed attempt to protect the Old Military Road from landslides and talk of taking  years to solve the problem.This is just not good enough.

That is a tough place to be in.The first occasion, He told them to go out again into deeper water , on the second occasion,it was to cast the net on the right side of the boat. In both accounts, these fishermen caught so many fish the nets were at breaking point.Oh, that it could always be as straightforward as that!Right now, fishermen and their families are facing such a dficult time and feeling that their voices are not being heard. These Bible stories remind us that their need and cry is heard by Jesus, the one who chose fishermen as His companions whilst on earth.We too must not forget them and this important industry in our west coast communities. I hope you will join me in praying for them, not only for their daily safety but also for provision and wisdom.In these stories, there is a lesson for us all to think about.

Her image is everything, a potent symbol of UK sovereignty abroad. Even the Scottish National Party buys into royal mystique and accords the monarch pride of place in its independence project. Not perhaps for much longer.This crisis is arguably worse than the Abdication in . Then, the monarchy was a robust and unchallengeable part of the British institutional landscape. Edward and his American orcee went into convenient exile and relative obscurity. Meghan isnt going quietly. She is a destroyer ndash a heat-seeking missile, and she was bang on target.Read more: Its time for the SNP to ditch its attachment to the Queen, that last remnant of empireShe accused the royal family of propagating hoods, failing in its duty of care, discriminating against her children, ignoring her suicidal tendencies and putting her familys le in danger by withdrawing protection. Her tale of victimhood has reverberated across the world and particularly in the Commonwealth of former British colonies. Nothing could be more damaging than the head of the Commonwealth being tainted with racism.Meghan has at her back an army of international celebrities led by Hillary Clinton, who accused the royals of ldquooutrageous cruelty astheyd held Meghan in a dungeon in the Tower. Brexit Britain was already being portrayed by the US media as a reactionary and xenophobic place. Now comes confirmation from within.It hardly matters that much of what the Duchess said was nonsense. She claimed that during her pregnancy she was not allowed to visit her friends and was only allowed out twice in four months. If thats true the royals were guilty of coercive control, a criminal offence. The isolation, she said, contributed to her mental health problems and resulted in ldquosuicidal thoughts for which she was given ldquono support.She said that she approached the human relations office and was told they couldnt help because she wasnt an employee. This is hardly surprising. The Sussexes had their own private office staffed by well-paid people whose job it was to look after her welfare. They could have bought the best psychiatric help on the planet. Her husband, Harry, even co-founded a charity for people with mental health issues, Heads Together. Did he ignore his own wes psychological deterioration Meghan complained that her son, Archie, had been blackballed by the Palace because of ldquoconcerns about his colour. She says she was told he would not automatically be a prince, which is true since the Queens great-grandchildren dont automatically take on the title. Archie could become a princeand when Charles, his grandfather, becomes king.But this was not about protocol, but race. She connected the unspecied ldquoconversations about his skin colour with the fact that Archie was being deprived of his royal title ndash at risk to his le. Its not clear which she thought was worse: the racism or the fact that she was told, again during her pregnancy, that her son would not have police protection.Was she suggesting here that her protection officers would have been withdrawn because Archie was not immediately to become a prince  That is plainly wrong. The royal protection squad would never have been taken from Prince Harry and his family while he remained an active royal. Security costs only became an issue when the couple said they wanted to leave, ldquostand back, from their royal roles and seek their fortunes in Canada and America. They couldnt have it both ways and continue to be funded by UK taxpayers after theyd departed for La La Land.Read more: Its time to abolish the monarchyIn one of many startling revelations Harry said: ldquoMy family literally cut me off financially.... His dad wouldnt answer his calls, either. Thats obviously an issue for the Prince of Wales, who holds the purse strings. But the Sussexes werent exactly left penniless. Harry had around pound million from investments left by his mother and Meghan had her own millions. They are getting poundm from Netflix and Spoty. Harry said that ldquogoing to the streamers was never part of the plan. Perhaps not, but since they intended to earn large sums of money to pay for their pound million Santa Barbara mansion, media work must have been in the back of their minds.There were predictable claims of racism in the British media. The press is disrespectful, sometimes cruelly so but, unlike social media, claims of actual racism against Meghan have never been substantiated. Yet the Duchess is now offering concrete proof that the royal family itself, the pinnacle of state privilege, is racist. Just how ldquodark would Archie be This was the cruellest cut of all, and one the Palace cannot allow to stand. The context of the remark, or remarks, was not made clear. It was Prince Harry who heard it and he was refusing to ldquoshare any more of the story. Yet hed already shared the greatest possible libel of his own family. There can be no charge more damaging to a institution today than that it harbours racists.Could it have been a misunderstanding  I was once accused of racism for saying that, when watching her legal drama Suits, it had never occurred to me that Meghan was black. It was only after she hooked up with Harry that I learned she was a Person of Colour. Butit was a similarly misconstrued remark, the Palace should make that clear.

That problem continues to pose concerns, not least over whether the sizeable gatherings outside Ibrox and in Glasgowrsquos George Square might be repeated, perhaps at the upcoming Old Firm match.I watched Celtic draw with Dundee United last weekend, a result which guaranteed the Premiership for Rangers. Football fans will perhaps understand that my first thought was that my team, United, now had virtually no chance of securing a top six place in the league, and thus avoiding a possible relegation battle. BRIAN TAYLOR:This is not a civil war in the SNP. This is more vicious and more visceralHowever, the wider consequences soon emerged as Rangers fans mustered to celebrate their teamrsquos success, in clear breach of rules prohibiting mass gatherings.Condemnation was swt from the First Minister, Opposition leaders and the police. While praising Rangersrsquo sporting achievement, they declared that the supportersrsquo actions were unacceptable and dangerous. They reminded us bluntly that closely packed crowds had the potential to spread disease and even death.Let us be clear. Parliament has the democratic power to prescribe rules. Within those rules, the police have a duty to proscribe behaviour which threatens the peace and, in this case, the health of citizens. Law and order must be maintained.The question is how. What is the truly effective way to prevent repetition  To do that, we need to understand the motivations underlying the behaviour we all witnessed.Otherwise, we risk making matters worse, we risk reinforcing a negative stereotype. To say this is in no way ndash I stress, in no way whatsoever ndash to condone the behaviour on display. It was dangerous and, potentially, deadly.Nicola Sturgeon has warned the Old FirmFirstly, I would broadly exculpate the police. You will hear it said either that they over-reacted or that they should have made far more arrests.The police did not create the situation. The fans gathered instinctively, emotively, no doubt prompted by social media. The police had to deal with events as they found them.An over-zealous response would have risked provoking the crowd, amplying the challenge to public order. Precisely the opposite of what the police were seeking to achieve.Secondly, consider the intrinsic nature of football support. We are dealing here with fans, or fanatics. For many, their le is defined by their vigorous adherence to their team. They exult in victory, they despair at defeat.This particular triumph for Rangers followed a decade without winning the league title a decade in which they had to rise from the lowest rank in Scottish football. In winning, they thwarted their greatest rivals.More generally, many fans regard their support for their team in an antithetical fashion to rival clubs, or even to society more generally. It is no accident that many supporters sing ldquonobody likes us, we donrsquot care. Their contrived self-image is as a beleaguered tribe, standing together against an external foe or an uncaring world.That is true of the most fervent of fans generally but it is particularly true of the Old Firm. Their adherents will often define themselves in contradistinction to the other side. Which can present a challenge for neutral observers or, indeed, for politicians seeking to intervene.Grimacing wryly, Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs this week that half of Glasgow presumed she was partisan for one side of the Old Firm while the other half presumed exactly the contrary. She was, she stressed, unconcerned about the colour of the shirt.It was also notable in Rangersrsquo official statement that they immediately drew attention to what they regarded as ldquoan unbalanced approach adopted towards their half of the Old Firm.In that same statement, Rangers insisted they had taken every step to pre-empt and deter such behaviour. It might be pertinent to note here that broader support for that analysis is distinctly limited. Further, eventhey were doing all they could, then those efforts demonstrably failed.Crucially, however, Rangers supporters will agree with their club. They will discern bias against them which others do not spot. Such a standpoint is not entirely unknown on the other side of the Glasgow sporting ide, nor indeed in football more generally. They are not known as fans for nothing. Once again, that does not remotely exonerate the behaviour we witnessed.However, it is also the case that there are many Rangers fans who will regret the scenes witnessed, who will seek to dispel any bad odour lingering around their clubrsquos remarkable success. As The Herald reported, supportersrsquo groups have raised thousands of pounds to repair damaged benches in George Square.Equally, though, those of us who are football fans need to reflect that many, perhaps most, people in Scotland are not. BRIAN TAYLOR:Sturgeonrsquos inquiry performance was thorough, respectful, controlled and capableRemember Brenda from Bristol  On being told that a further General Election was pending, she replied: ldquoYoursquore joking! What, another one !Translate that from Brendarsquos broad Bristol accent into Scots, and you have it pat. For many in Scotland, their reaction to another controversy in football is ennui. They find it weary, stale and flat full of sound and fury and signying nothing.In that light, we now need action which will be effective, rather than simply voluble. Perhaps a promise of substantial celebrations deferred, linked to the warning that the Old Firm game may have to be cancelled. Perhaps a reminder of possible sanctions by the European football authority.It will not be sufficient for that message to be delivered solely by politicians. Still less, by the police. That will not work with the truly zealous.Football leaders must douse their instinctive indignation and urge compliance. Consistently and without equivocation. In tandem with politicians and the police. It may be exasperating that such effort is required but anything  risks further failure.

No positive impacts were noted.The report states that in Orkney, “the total impact is estimated as . FTE jobs and £, in gross salaries. These jobs and salaries will be lost in  under ATMS.”Mr McArthur has been calling on both HIAL and the Scottish Government to halt the centralisation plans for a number of years and has described the report’s findings as making this case ‘stronger than ever.’Commenting on the findings, Mr McArthur said: “We’ve known for months that HIAL’s plans are damaging for our islands, but the impact assessment has revealed the full scale of this decision for our community.“The report not only underlines what HIAL’s own advisers warned them at the very beginning, that this is the riskiest and costliest option, but also details in no uncertain terms that these proposals will have a detrimental long-term impact on our leline services and local economy.“Nobody has ever questioned the need to modernise air traffic control services but HIAL’s insistence that they do it by deploying ATMS is becoming less credible each day.#With costs for the project continuing to rise at a time when the aviation sector is facing considerable uncertainty, the case for halting the strategy is stronger than ever.“Ministers must also absorb responsibility for these damning findings and, along with HIAL, take heed of the warnings outlined in this reportwe are to safeguard air traffic services in the islands and uphold the credibility of island impact assessments.#Serious consideration must be given to calling time on these centralisation proposals.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This ensures that local authorities are fully funded to operate their internal ferry services.“This delivers a key ask from the Scottish Government#s local authority partners at a time of unprecedented financial pressure on the Scottish budget.“Of course for Orkney it facilitates the introduction of Sunday services and Road Equivalent Tarfon inter-island ferries.“The Scottish Government has stated that it is well aware of the growing need for local authorities to replace ageing ferry fleets and infrastructure. While responsibility for funding replacement infrastructure remains with the councils, Scottish Ministers are committed to continuing engagement.“The passing of the budget also means £. million is coming Orkney Islands Council’s way, up £. million on last year — a . per cent hike.”Both Mr Leslie and Orkney#s MSP, Liam McArthur, welcomed increased spending in areas such as mental health services, education, green initiatives, business support and agri-environment.Mr Leslie added: “I am sure folk across Orkney will join me in welcoming this budget, there is plenty in it for islanders to be pleased about as we look to build a better, fairer and greener future for us all.”Meanwhile, Mr McArthur welcomed a number of concessions included in the budget, notably the additional funding for Orkney#s internal ferry services.But he says this now needs to be a long-term commitment from the Scottish Government and backed by support for new vessels.Commenting on the budget, Mr McArthur said: “Over the last year, along with my Scottish Liberal Democrat colleagues, I have sought to hold the government to account over its handling of this crisis. I have done so, however, constructively and with the interests of supporting constituents and our community at the forefront.“That approach has remained the same during this year’s budget negotiations and I’m pleased that we’ve secured funding for a number of areas that will be important for our country’s recovery. A signicant increase in investment for mental health services, for example, delivers on a key ask from the Scottish Liberal Democrats as we look to address our country’s mental health crisis.“The additional funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services is also very welcome after years of broken promises and Orkney being short changed.  It’s vital, though, that this is not just a one-off pre-election gesture but part of a long term commitment by government that also includes addressing the urgent need for new vessels.“Meantime, I’m glad that cross-party agreement could be reached on this budget at a time when politicians from all parties should be absolutely focused on putting the recovery first.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Centralisation remains the most expensive and most economically damaging option and yet HIAL are determined to continue with it.“The proposal of yet another independent study on generating further economic activity falls far short of what is required here. HIAL should immediately pause this project and commission a genuinely independent report considering the feasibility of an alternative localised model,they refuse to do so then the Scottish Government must step in.“This is a major test of the credibility of the Islands Act which was intended to stop projects like this and ensure organisations considered less damaging alternatives. If organisations are allowed to simply ignore these Assessments then the whole Act will be rendered little more than a PR exercise.”On the issue of staffing he added: “The report also confirms Prospect own survey which found that staff in island communities will not relocate to Inverness. HIAL need to explain how they intend to live up to their promise of no compulsory redundancies as all evidence suggests that widespread redundancies now seem inevitable.#While HIAL has claimed that the report proves that an alternative local surveillance solution is #not viable#, Prospect fundamentally disagrees with this assessment.Mr Avery said: “HIAL’s claim that local implementation is not viable or that this report endorses their position is simply not true. This report states HIAL’s position, it very clearly does not endorse it. Any attempt to claim the contrary is just more desperate spin.“Local implementation of air traffic services including surveillance is how air traffic is implemented at almost every airport across the UK including at HIAL’s own Inverness airport. It is a viable workable and resilient alternative but HIAL refuse to consider it.#Meanwhile, HIAL has promised to engage with local authorities across the Highlands and Islands region as it seeks to deliver #viable solutions# to secure the future of leline air services.The company#s managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “We have always known there would be impacts by undertaking such a signicant and complex change management programme.“To date, there have been no alternative proposals that provide a solution that fully addresses all of the challenges HIAL currently faces.”“We hope that everyone with a vested interest in the long-term future of air traffic services in the Highlands and Islands will work us to deliver viable solutions that will maintain leline services and essential connectivity for generations to come.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We’re not complaining about that — the ferry pays its dues — but we have to find a way of reconciling the effect that has on Ullapool#s tourist trade because the place where visitors congregate to admire the loch and the view is Shore Street.In addition, the -year-old sea wall will be replaced with a higher structure to protect the village from rising sea levels.As part of the pre-application consultation, an online Zoom meeting will be held tonight at pm when the proposals will be presented for the first time and as many people as possible are being urged to take part.To join the meeting people can visit the website: http:www.ullapool-harbour or phone    and enter meeting ID:  to listen in.Anyone who wishes to make representations can do so by contacting Fiona Henderson, Affric Limited, Lochview Office, Loch Duntelchaig, Farr, IV AW, or by email: consultation@affriclimited, by th March ."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ARCHIVE-CENT-ANGUS-OG-6.jpg","title":"chust lovely angus og finds a new home in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe collection of the comic strips were handed over to the Skye and Lochalsh Archive Centre in Portree, in recognition of Angus Òg creator Ewen Bain and his family links to Skye.Ewen was brought up in Maryhill, Glasgow but his father John hailed from Waternish and his mother Flora from Staffin.

Because of what we’ve been through and the fact that we don’t want to go back there, you should maybe listen to us a bit more because we’re maybe the solution to some of the decisions that you’re taking.”Kielty said that having two nationalities and two identities meant people had to learn about compromise.“Maybe we’re not the crazy cousins after all. Maybe we’re the people that are clean and sober and turned up at your doorstep to say that you might need to see somebody instead,” he added.Kielty, who recently finished shooting his debut movie role in the bittersweet comedy Ballywalter, said there were always going to be problems around a land or sea border and pointed out that Northern Ireland voted against leaving the EU.“We could see this coming down the tracks in slow-motion and were watching everybody  going double-speed down the tracks to get to the place where,you’re from Northern Ireland, you’re going ‘no, no, no’,” he explained.“That’s why I wanted to write this show. Also, it meant having a  to speak to the rest of the UK and say, ‘Actually, we might know stuff that you might think about listening to’.”The dad-of-two, who is married to presenter Cat Deeley, stressed that living in the US during the Trump presidency had taught him that people had a tendency to “nationalise traits”.He said: “When people say to me that Trump is a typical stupid Yank, I say, ‘No, he’s a -year-old man who made his money from construction, cheats at golf and always thinks he’s right. There is one of those guys in every pub in Ireland.“Humans are humans and traits are inidual traits. Everyone is dferent, so to collectively say, ‘That’s that group for you’, is wrong.”Kielty, whose dad Jack was shot dead by loyalist paramilitaries in , also discussed My Dad, the Peace Deal and Me, his award-winning documentary, aired in .He revealed that when the show went out, he was in the US and too frightened to watch it in case he let down people at home.“The responsibility was to tell the story of the place and how far we’d come, but also not to be self-indulgent because we’ve all been through it,” he said.“The only thing I cared about was what people at home thought about it.”Borderline: A Postcard From the Edge will be aired on Radio  on March Belfast Most ReadBoris Johnson refuses to meet SF leader Mary Lou McDonald during Northern Ireland visitHughes Insurance moves staff to permanent home working with more jobs and cash paymentCo Down man Colm Quinn dies after construction site accident in AmericaCoronavirus Northern Ireland: One death and  new cases reported as Boris Johnson visits Enniskillen vaccination centreJuror flees to France after UDA threat to set accused freeTop VideosPlayFight breaks out in front of Carl Frampton#s car in BelfastPlayVideo: Celtic fan struck at Belfast airport - Warning Strong LanguagePlayMichelle O#Neill ‘fell asleep’ during Harry and Meghan interviewLatest BrexitHas EU#s vaccine failure punctured the border poll bubble Boris Johnson urges loyalists not to rail against Northern Ireland protocolArlene Foster: People feel like #lesser citizens# because of Northern Ireland ProtocolBoris Bridge: Foster left bemused by critics of proposed Northern Ireland-Scotland connectionLatest from Belfast David Healy out to find solutions to Linfeld#s Carrick Rangers problemGlentoran #will respond and bounce back# after #kick in the backside# defeat to Ballymena, says Mick McDermottNevada district sees first case of UK Covid- iantBrendan Rodgers welcomes break for Jamie VardyFour killed as Myanmar forces continue crackdown on protesters,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Officials hope to be able to administer , shots a week.It is unclear what role the military will play and whether personnel will be involved in logistics, providing a supporting role at vaccination centres, orthey will administer the vaccine.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: “I authorised the deployment of  defence medics to support the vaccine rollout in Northern Ireland from the end of this month.“Our Armed Forces are once again stepping up to support the UK’s response to the pandemic, working around the clock to protect our people in all four corners of the nation.”Mr Swann said it will help accelerate the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland.He added: “It is very welcome that our vaccinator numbers are being boosted, as we move into an expansion of the programme.“The military support confirmed today is being provided following my formal request.”DUP MLA Pam Cameron, the vice-chair of the Stormont health committee, said it was a boost to the vaccine drive.“This is fantastic news and once again demonstrates the strength and depth of the national commitment to supporting the fight against Covid- in every region of our United Kingdom,” she said.“The addition of  medically trained military personnel will provide a welcome boost to the health and social care staff who have thus far spearheaded a highly successful rollout of the vaccine across our province.“Their arrival will coincide with the launch of the mass vaccination centre at the SSE Arena and will help to ensure the next phase of the programme targeted at the general population runs as smoothly and effectively as possible.”Official figures released yesterday suggested the Kent iant of the virus — now the dominant strain in Northern Ireland — was hindering attempts to bring the pandemic under control.The number of people diagnosed with Covid- over the past seven days rose by % compared to the previous week.According to the Department of Health’s daily dashboard, , new cases were diagnosed over the past seven days, compared to , over the previous seven-day period.A department spokesman said: “Data suggests that the B-iant now accounts for % of infections“That means in circumstances where people are having more contacts, the epidemic will grow even more quickly than it has done previously.“This is something that we all need to be cognitive of as we gradually begin to ease out of restrictions in the weeks and months ahead.”The Office for National Statistics’ weekly Covid bulletin, also released yesterday, showed more people in Northern Ireland were infected with the virus than in Scotland and Wales at the end of last week.But there were fewer people here infected than in England, where one in  was infected.The report said: “In Northern Ireland, the percentage of people testing positive appears to have levelled off in the week ending March . We estimate that , people in Northern Ireland had Covid-, equating to around one in  people.”The latest bulletin from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agencyshowed another decline in the number of people losing their lives as a result of Covid-.There were  local Covid deaths recorded between February  and March  — down from  the previous week.It was the sixth week in a row in which there was a drop in the number of death certicates citing coronavirus.According to Nisra, there have been , Covid-related deaths in Northern Ireland since the start of the pandemic.A further  new cases and one death were recorded in the past  hours.

Crows cackle in the trees above the Walled Garden and the smell of freshly slurried fields attacks the senses on the way through. The Largantogher Walkway cuts through the town. Through the dense trees lies the disputed Maghera High School site, ground zero in a long-running battle between the council and a local environmental group over its new purpose.

Back on Main Street, tattered Slaughtneil flags hang outside the Dugout Bar, clinging on in defiance as it continues to wait for a reopening commitment. Two men in caps are chatting outside Kellys Eurospar. A woman opens the door of the pharmacy across the road and calls out. She wants to knowhes going in for the paper.     “Ive no money on me,” comes the reply. The chapel and Fairhill Youth Centre are deserted, but at Crawfordsburn four children move in tandem on the swings. Two teenage girls walk down Glenview, eating from a bag of chips. Its a case of small mercies for the young amid the pandemic. An empty playground at Crawfordsburn. Children have been hit hard by the pandemic. A mounted sign at the entrance to Crawfordsburn Drive urges Solidarity with Palestine. Across the road, a more understated sign from Watty Grahams GAC urges people to take home their rubbish. On the way back in the road, the play park is once again deserted. Neither young nor old are hanging around too long these days. At the corner of Fairhill, McKennas Bar is operating their off licence, and doing a brisk Friday afternoon trade. A table cordoning off the entrance and a screen that drops down from the ceiling bring a sobering reality to the scene. Caitliacuten McKenna is actually reading the Derry Post as I arrive and says it might be the first time shes given us her real name. Shes referring to the Out and About pictures, smiling revellers appeasing the photographer for a two-page spread that is sadly no longer a possibility. For now. Caitliacuten, Caoimhe, and owner Sean McKenna, are all pining for those better days. “Last summer was good craic out in the beer garden,” says Caitliacuten. “Wed always had that space but we revamped it a good bit to make more use of it. Even people who knew it was there were surprised at how big it was when it was overhauled. “Its not too hard to get your , steps a day carrying pints out there.” “Its been a big change, serving people through the hatch and not letting anybody in. Youd have been used to people around the bar a lot of the time,” adds Sean. Sean, Caoimhe and Caitliacuten McKenna hard at work in McKennas Bar. “This is a social hub, youd have had people in and out all the time, whereas out there, though they may be some of the same people from the bar, theyre only staying for a minute and away they go again. “Another change is Im sitting at home on a Friday or Saturday night from  oclock thinking I should be doing something.” The flow of customers interrupts our chat. People finishing up work for the weekend, some calling in on a whim, others a more regular sight. Caoimhe tells me it has been hard on those regulars for whom the pub is very much an arena for conversation. “You do get some who will stand and have a wee chat, because its maybe their only social interaction,” she says. “Its been a while since theyve seen some people, so you get a wee bit of gossip out there that you miss out on having the bar closed. “Then when it gets to  oclock, its mad out there, just before closing. Everybody ends up having a chat with each other at the hatch. “Theyre more likely to meet someone they know then. You also get a lot of people waving in while they are out for their exercise as well.”  We mention the general dferences between the current period of restrictions and the previous lockdowns, but its interesting to view them through the lens of the pub owners. “People arent buying as much drink as they were the first time round,” says Caoimhe. “The weather isnt the same and people cant sit outside in their gardens at the minute. It was a novelty, and people were almost treating it like a holiday. “The town is busier than last time round. It was really, really quiet before, but there is definitely more traffic and more people about than the previous lockdown. “We have noticed a wee bit of a change with a lot more people buying craft beer that they might have had access tothey were out in bars further afield – Belfast or Derry maybe. “A lot of people were making cocktails the first time down. People were asking for all sorts of things at the start that wed never had before because they were making cocktails.” On the way out, Sean draws my attention to the crystal Kalashnikov hanging above the off licence tills. From Russia with love. Covid-, a less welcome import from the East, has brought down a muffled filter on the streets of our towns and villages. Conversation is terse, interaction limited. Hope might spring eternal but you cant gulp on it forever. Magheras Covid rate fell into double figures last week, and despite a slight increase this week, expectant eyes turn towards the decisions of the NI Executive. Heading home on the Coleraine Road, the site of the old police station is busy with construction, the new leisure facilities moving closer to completion. Maghera is poised and ready when normality gets the green light.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Chivers, the current Club Chairman, was an advocate of kicking the ball. He would later train the All-Ireland winning team he helped build. The relentless kicking drills instilled the message that led to their first All-Ireland final goal. Johnny McGurks high ball created panic in the Salthill defence. Alan Mulholland made a catch, but then he tried to play himself out of danger, Seamus Downeys tackle led to Don Mulholland finding the net. Spirit and kicking in the same sentence, on the biggest of days. “Sometimes we gave it away, but we were a smaller team and the quicker we moved the ball the better,” McGurk adds. “If the full forward line was out in front you kicked it andthey werent, you took another hand to toe. You didnt hold the ball unless you had to.” Hugh Martin McGurk, at , was the oldest player on the starting team. But it took a brave decision at the start of the  season to set them on their way. A defeat to Dungiven in , McGurk felt, was a watershed moment. When John Brennan came in as manager the following year he had a decision to make. Back youth, or go for what had been before. “John had a big part to play in our overall determination and our healthy attitude for winning, he put that into us,” McGurk added. “John came in and bred a pile of young ones from those minor teams. At the risk of being caught out badly, he had the faith in us and it was a big thing.” It paid off when they saw off Newbridge and  years after watching Hurley lt the cup, McGurk looked on as Henry Downey did likewise and he could reach out and touch the championship medal he craved. *** By the start of the  season Brendan Convery took over as senior manager, with Paddy Chivers on board and Laveys dream season was about to get off the ground. Also part of the management team was Paddy Dillon and Brendan Henry, who mixed secretary duties with his magic sponge. “Nerowasnt a man for coaching and ball drills,” Johnny points out. “He wouldve watched training and picked up things about players, it helped him to make changes at important times. “He didnt get too annoyed at any stage. He had the character of a golfer, which he was, so he was relaxed and just watched.” Laveys road to glory began with a very testing game with Castledawson. After a convincing win over Ballerin, it set up a semi-final clash with Dungiven, a rivalry that seemed to pen a new chapter every year between football and hurling. “They were a serious outfit,” McGurk said. “Theyd players with county titles and plenty who had represented the county over the years at all levels. “It was always dog eat dog until itwas over but there was a healthy respect. Lavey and Dungiven wouldve always have got on off the pitch, wouldve sat and had a pint with each other.” After a tight opening spell, Brian McCormicks long kick from defence, won by Seamus Downey, led to Collie McGurks goal and Lavey went on to control the game. With Paddy McGurk and Liam McElhinney clawing for a loose ball, it ended up in the Lavey net to give Dungiven a leline. When Eunan OKane later levelled matters, it took points from McCormick and Johnny McGurk to put Lavey into the county final. After shipping an early Sean D ONeill goal in the final, a similar fisted effort to the Screen net by Seamus Downey had Lavey back in the game. In the final quarter, McCormicks goal opened up a six-point lead before Hugh Martin McGurk netted a third to put the result beyond doubt. “There was never a moment when we felt wed have a chance of winning an All-Ireland,” McGurk replied. “Most teams, they think about the next game and its one less and you just keep going... you think two games ahead, youre gone.” Donegal champions Naomh Columba were waiting in the first round of Ulster in Ballybofey, a team that included county stars John Joe Doherty, Paddy and Noel Hegarty. Two Felix Convery points saw Lavey emerge from a tough encounter. As the players mingled with supporters after the meal back in Jacksons Hotel, there was a sense that something special was brewing. To help create a matchday atmosphere, the team travelled by bus for the rest of the season, even their home semi-final with Armaghs Sarsfields in Ballinascreen. “There was a routine for the last  or  minutes before coming out and wed always have Sean South of Garryowen belting out in the bus as we arrived at the pitch,” McGurk remembers. It was a tempestuous game and another one of inches. In the dying moments, Brian McCormicks scrappy goal, greeted by Collie McGurks somersault to celebrate amid a deafening din of air horns, told Lavey they were in an Ulster club final. The final against Kingscourt was a walk in the park. Despite having Cavan county players Jim Reilly, Pat and Michael Faulkner, Lavey cut through them and won by  points. The party was in full flow when word filtered through out of the blue of their pending All-Ireland Quarter-Final with a star-studded Tir Chonaill Gaels, who boasted Mattie McGleenan and James McCartan in their ranks. “We thought we had the Christmas break and well have a few pints all week,” McGurk remembers of their celebrations eventually put on the back burner. A lack of preparation or knowledge of their London opponents left it another sticky game. It wasnt helped with the wintry weather leaving the game in doubt less than -hours before. “They gave us a fright,” McGurk said, of Laveys three-point deficit as the final minutes ticked away. James Chivers won a throw-in in front of the stand before feeding Seamus Downey, who kicked the ball forward. Their coaching drills always had them finding the man in space. This was dferent. It was the pressure cooker. All shape went out the window. It was all hands to the pump. In the end it was the old dog for the hard road. When corner-back Damien Dohertys low shot came back off the butt of the post,  year-old Anthony McGurk slam dunked the rebound to the net to level the game and Lavey won after extra-time. It was David versus Goliath in the All-Ireland semi-final at Celtic Park against Dublin giants Thomas Davis, who had Dublin players Paul Curran and Dave Foran in their side. Lavey had prepared a scouting trip to watch them in the Leinster final that turned into a bonding day in a Kildare hostelry. The fog had descended by the time the bus, with both players and supporters, arrived in Newbridge and the game was postponed. It took two goals to get Lavey over the line against Thomas Davis, with James Chivers having a hand in both. His fist past teased the Dublin keeper off his line, but the incoming Don Mulholland, who was second favourite to get to the ball, had no reverse gear. He got a hand to the ball, and seconds later Seamus Downey slammed to the net. In the second half, Chivers high ball forward saw Hugh Martin McGurk fouled. He took the kick himself and when it somehow squirmed to the net, Lavey had one foot in Croke Park. They still had to breathe a sigh of relief when a late Thomas Davis snapshot, the last kick of the game, flashed across goal “Theyclapped us off at the end of the game and that was a very fitting thing to do,” McGurk remembers. Teenager Brian McCormick kicked - as Lavey finished the job against Salthill to seal their All-Ireland. It was the final step in an enthralling journey. The outpouring of emotion befitted the endless hours of toil and development to reach the pinnacle. It was a victory for community and channelling everything into putting themselves on the map. Johnny McGurk raises the Andy Merrigan Cup at Croke ParkLater in the year, the Derry championships competitive edge was again evident when Dungiven knocked them off their perch, taking all three titles in one swoop in another tense encounter at Glen. Lavey won Ulster again in  before retaining their title the following year, the last time John McLaughlin paid a visit. There is always the regret of missing a second All-Ireland. After having two men sent off, they left themselves too much to do against Skibbereen, who went the whole way. McGurk feels the sendings off were harsh. “I think wed have won it had we got over them,” he laments. “People say we got lucky the year we won the All-Ireland, but there were other years when we were unlucky not to have won a county title. It was hard to win the Derry championship and like most Derry sides, wed have been competitivewed got into Ulster.” When the parish of Lavey wakes up next Wednesday, the first thing theyll remember will be that magical day,  years ago, when a wave of emotion, on the back of years of toil, carried the Andy Merrigan Cup into their lives.\",\"keywords\":\"Lavey,,Johnny McGurk,All-Ireland Champions,Derry\",\"articleSection\":\"GAA\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Thirty years ago Lavey were crowned All-Ireland club champions.

Captain Johnny McGurk looks back on a year of memories and what made their journey special. Michael McMullan tells the story...Spirit. Johnny McGurk may be scanning back  years, but his answer is instant. What immediately comes to mind when he reflects on  and Laveys -game march to dreamland  Those two syllables say it all for the skipper. The Andy Merrigan Cup in McGurks grasp is like the parish he represented on that magical March Sunday. Small in appearance, but massive in every other way. Joxer was just  years of age when Niall Hurley held aloft the John McLaughlin Cup to end a -year Derry championship famine in . Hed always dreamt of winning a championship. “I remember standing behind the goals with a pile of other wains,” McGurk said of that afternoon in Magherafelt when Paddy Chivers pass set up Joe Boyles clinching goal in a - to - win over Ballinderry. googletag.cmd.push Standing in the Hogan Stand, on St Patricks Day , the clubs greatest day, the entire parish congregated below him, awash with orange and black. They emit pride and joy in equal measure. For McGurk, every man, woman and child represented the players the same as the players did for them. It was a two way street. Right down to Parish Priest Fr ODonnells fanatic support of the team. “After games, you werent as much a player, you were just part of the whole setup,” McGurk outlines. “Everybody was in the middle of it and nobody got any special treatment. There was a wave and everybody was on it...thank God it kept going. The spirit and atmosphere in the parish is something that always sticks with me.” googletag.cmd.push The Lavey team and some of their young supporters after the  Derry county final Lavey needed every ounce of their resilience in a season littered with turning points. On the face of it, their Derry, Ulster and All-Ireland finals offered the most daylight on the scoreboard. “Its easy to say that after a final,” McGurk says in disagreement. He digs deeper. Finals were there to be won. Moments from Laveys five-point win All-Ireland final win over Salthill were tense enough. It took a fullsave from Brendan Regan to prevent Mark Butler a certain goal that wouldve levelled the game in the second half. The same player denied Collie McGurk, Don Mulholland and the Downey brothers Hogan Cup glory with a late winning point seven years earlier.     “I dont relax in games, the only time I enjoyed was after them,” Johnny admits. Growing up, to win a Derry championship wouldve been a focus. Winning the top prize was never in his wildest dreams. “To come home with the cup on the Sunday night after the All-Ireland final was one of the most special moments youd ever have in your le.” After stepping off the bus, the kit-bags were stowed away in the dressing room before they paraded into the packed hall. On the stage behind them was a series of stars, each with their name. Goosebumps stuff. “It was a packed house for most of the nights that year,” McGurk recalls. “Population wise, we hadnt the greatest of numbers, but whoever was in any way attached to Lavey was there.” Last autumn, his sons Patrick and James retained their minor championship title on a team playing a ied brand of football. Johnny and Seamus Downey coached the team that includes their sons. The new crop are beacons for the future. Like all the clubs teams, the black star on the back of their jersies is the imprint of , when Lavey stood tallest. *** A November birthday isnt an underage players best friend. Especially one as slight as Johnny McGurk. Derrys U leagues didnt begin until he was overage. After primary school, there was nothing until U. Coming from a family of  and one of eight boys, sport was never far away. Their mother Catherine Bradley came from a family steeped in music and dance in Tobermore, while also lining out for Desertmartin camogs. “To throw a ball or a hurling stick out in the evening was as big a rest for my father and mother as anything,” Johnny said. Sadly, their father Hugh A tragically died after taking ill while watching his sons in championship action for Lavey against Newbridge on at Greenlough in . Growing up, he had high standards. Three things werent accepted, as Johnny outlines pulling out of a ball, not putting in the necessary effort and needlessly lying down. As a  year-old, Johnny shipped a decent tackle on a wet night against Banagher. A voice from outside the pitch, told him, in no uncertain terms, to get back on his feet. It was his father. “I got up brave and sharp, I can tell you,” Johnny laughs. “Hed let you know, but he was your biggest fan at the same time.” Packed into the car, with more bums than seats, to watch his older brother Anthony play for Derry in far flung corners of Ireland ignited a desire to play at the highest level. GAA was always top of the menu, but the local soccer games between Lower and Upper Gulladuff sharpened the competitive edge, the sort that end at dark or a call for dinner. “We were known as Upper Gulladuff. There werent too many of us and there were plenty of them, but that was kicking lumps out of each other every evening,” Johnny remembers. “There was a competitiveness about it which stood to us in later years.” At U level, Lavey were on the wrong side of a few hidings and the dream of winning a championship medal was light years away. Glenullins talented teams were ahead of them. They couldnt compete with the numbers Glen, Bellaghy and Dungiven had, while Kilrea also dished out hammerings. “We were well down the pecking order coming up,” was Johnnys take on the early years. Persistence was an important ingredient in the process. An U title arrived, followed by back to back minor titles in  and . It would form the backbone of a senior team on the cusp of making the breakthrough. “Paddy Chivers wouldve been instrumental in the younger years and the Doctook us as well, he was a great influence,” Johnny points out. Chivers, the current Club Chairman, was an advocate of kicking the ball. He would later train the All-Ireland winning team he helped build. The relentless kicking drills instilled the message that led to their first All-Ireland final goal. Johnny McGurks high ball created panic in the Salthill defence. Alan Mulholland made a catch, but then he tried to play himself out of danger, Seamus Downeys tackle led to Don Mulholland finding the net. Spirit and kicking in the same sentence, on the biggest of days. “Sometimes we gave it away, but we were a smaller team and the quicker we moved the ball the better,” McGurk adds. “If the full forward line was out in front you kicked it andthey werent, you took another hand to toe. You didnt hold the ball unless you had to.” Hugh Martin McGurk, at , was the oldest player on the starting team. But it took a brave decision at the start of the  season to set them on their way. A defeat to Dungiven in , McGurk felt, was a watershed moment. When John Brennan came in as manager the following year he had a decision to make. Back youth, or go for what had been before. “John had a big part to play in our overall determination and our healthy attitude for winning, he put that into us,” McGurk added. “John came in and bred a pile of young ones from those minor teams. At the risk of being caught out badly, he had the faith in us and it was a big thing.” It paid off when they saw off Newbridge and  years after watching Hurley lt the cup, McGurk looked on as Henry Downey did likewise and he could reach out and touch the championship medal he craved. *** By the start of the  season Brendan Convery took over as senior manager, with Paddy Chivers on board and Laveys dream season was about to get off the ground. Also part of the management team was Paddy Dillon and Brendan Henry, who mixed secretary duties with his magic sponge. “Nerowasnt a man for coaching and ball drills,” Johnny points out. “He wouldve watched training and picked up things about players, it helped him to make changes at important times. “He didnt get too annoyed at any stage. He had the character of a golfer, which he was, so he was relaxed and just watched.” Laveys road to glory began with a very testing game with Castledawson. After a convincing win over Ballerin, it set up a semi-final clash with Dungiven, a rivalry that seemed to pen a new chapter every year between football and hurling. “They were a serious outfit,” McGurk said. “Theyd players with county titles and plenty who had represented the county over the years at all levels. “It was always dog eat dog until itwas over but there was a healthy respect. Lavey and Dungiven wouldve always have got on off the pitch, wouldve sat and had a pint with each other.” After a tight opening spell, Brian McCormicks long kick from defence, won by Seamus Downey, led to Collie McGurks goal and Lavey went on to control the game. With Paddy McGurk and Liam McElhinney clawing for a loose ball, it ended up in the Lavey net to give Dungiven a leline. When Eunan OKane later levelled matters, it took points from McCormick and Johnny McGurk to put Lavey into the county final. After shipping an early Sean D ONeill goal in the final, a similar fisted effort to the Screen net by Seamus Downey had Lavey back in the game. In the final quarter, McCormicks goal opened up a six-point lead before Hugh Martin McGurk netted a third to put the result beyond doubt. “There was never a moment when we felt wed have a chance of winning an All-Ireland,” McGurk replied. “Most teams, they think about the next game and its one less and you just keep going... you think two games ahead, youre gone.” Donegal champions Naomh Columba were waiting in the first round of Ulster in Ballybofey, a team that included county stars John Joe Doherty, Paddy and Noel Hegarty. Two Felix Convery points saw Lavey emerge from a tough encounter. As the players mingled with supporters after the meal back in Jacksons Hotel, there was a sense that something special was brewing. To help create a matchday atmosphere, the team travelled by bus for the rest of the season, even their home semi-final with Armaghs Sarsfields in Ballinascreen. “There was a routine for the last  or  minutes before coming out and wed always have Sean South of Garryowen belting out in the bus as we arrived at the pitch,” McGurk remembers. It was a tempestuous game and another one of inches. In the dying moments, Brian McCormicks scrappy goal, greeted by Collie McGurks somersault to celebrate amid a deafening din of air horns, told Lavey they were in an Ulster club final. The final against Kingscourt was a walk in the park. Despite having Cavan county players Jim Reilly, Pat and Michael Faulkner, Lavey cut through them and won by  points. The party was in full flow when word filtered through out of the blue of their pending All-Ireland Quarter-Final with a star-studded Tir Chonaill Gaels, who boasted Mattie McGleenan and James McCartan in their ranks. “We thought we had the Christmas break and well have a few pints all week,” McGurk remembers of their celebrations eventually put on the back burner. A lack of preparation or knowledge of their London opponents left it another sticky game. It wasnt helped with the wintry weather leaving the game in doubt less than -hours before. “They gave us a fright,” McGurk said, of Laveys three-point deficit as the final minutes ticked away. James Chivers won a throw-in in front of the stand before feeding Seamus Downey, who kicked the ball forward. Their coaching drills always had them finding the man in space. This was dferent. It was the pressure cooker. All shape went out the window. It was all hands to the pump. In the end it was the old dog for the hard road. When corner-back Damien Dohertys low shot came back off the butt of the post,  year-old Anthony McGurk slam dunked the rebound to the net to level the game and Lavey won after extra-time. It was David versus Goliath in the All-Ireland semi-final at Celtic Park against Dublin giants Thomas Davis, who had Dublin players Paul Curran and Dave Foran in their side. Lavey had prepared a scouting trip to watch them in the Leinster final that turned into a bonding day in a Kildare hostelry. The fog had descended by the time the bus, with both players and supporters, arrived in Newbridge and the game was postponed. It took two goals to get Lavey over the line against Thomas Davis, with James Chivers having a hand in both. His fist past teased the Dublin keeper off his line, but the incoming Don Mulholland, who was second favourite to get to the ball, had no reverse gear. He got a hand to the ball, and seconds later Seamus Downey slammed to the net. In the second half, Chivers high ball forward saw Hugh Martin McGurk fouled. He took the kick himself and when it somehow squirmed to the net, Lavey had one foot in Croke Park. They still had to breathe a sigh of relief when a late Thomas Davis snapshot, the last kick of the game, flashed across goal “Theyclapped us off at the end of the game and that was a very fitting thing to do,” McGurk remembers. Teenager Brian McCormick kicked - as Lavey finished the job against Salthill to seal their All-Ireland. It was the final step in an enthralling journey. The outpouring of emotion befitted the endless hours of toil and development to reach the pinnacle. It was a victory for community and channelling everything into putting themselves on the map. Johnny McGurk raises the Andy Merrigan Cup at Croke Park  Later in the year, the Derry championships competitive edge was again evident when Dungiven knocked them off their perch, taking all three titles in one swoop in another tense encounter at Glen. Lavey won Ulster again in  before retaining their title the following year, the last time John McLaughlin paid a visit. There is always the regret of missing a second All-Ireland. After having two men sent off, they left themselves too much to do against Skibbereen, who went the whole way. McGurk feels the sendings off were harsh. “I think wed have won it had we got over them,” he laments. “People say we got lucky the year we won the All-Ireland, but there were other years when we were unlucky not to have won a county title. It was hard to win the Derry championship and like most Derry sides, wed have been competitivewed got into Ulster.” When the parish of Lavey wakes up next Wednesday, the first thing theyll remember will be that magical day,  years ago, when a wave of emotion, on the back of years of toil, carried the Andy Merrigan Cup into their lives.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Job Retention Scheme was introduced last March to support businesses and organisations who had to temporarily lay off staff due to the pandemic. The government said it would pay up % of the salary of employees placed on furlough. At one stage, the local council had placed  employees on furlough. The council had agreed to pay the remaining % of the furloughed workers salaries during the lay-off period to ensure they received their full pay. Almost half of the council employees have ed to work but  remain on furlough. Details on the money saved by the council as a result of the furlough scheme were outlined on Tuesday at a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Committee. googletag.cmd.push A report shared with councillors at the meeting revealed that from March last year to January this year, the council had recouped a total of pound,, from the furlough scheme. The furlough scheme had been due to end on April  next. However, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, this week announced that the scheme would be extended to the end of September this year. The Job Retention Scheme has protected more than  million jobs since its inception last year and has been credited for slowing the pace of job losses as businesses remain shut. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two years ago, the council commissioned Playboard NI to carry out a detailed audit of all the play facilities available in the local area. The findings of the audit were outlined yesterday at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. Alan Herron, Director of Service Delivery and Development with Playboard NI, told the meeting that they had inspected  play parks in the council area in November and December . They had also consulted with the local communities to find out their views on the play facilities. googletag.cmd.push Mr Herron said the parks had been awarded scores in relation to their standards. The audit report showed that in the council area, only six play parks secured enough points to be placed in the top band. These included Brooke Park, Pennyburn Play Trail, Ballyarnett Play Park and Strathfoyle Park. A total of  parks were assessed to be in the upper mid band category which means they offer a good level of play value but require ongoing maintenance. Some of the local parks in this bracket were St Columbs Park, Galliagh Park, Irish Street Park, Rose Court and Lapwing Way. googletag.cmd.push The next bracket was lower mid band and  parks in the Derry and Strabane council area were placed in this category. In Derry, these included Oakland Park, Shantallow Park, the Fountain Park, Bull Park and Primity Crescent. According to the Playboard NI report, these parks offer a low value of play value and will require upgrading to bring them up to an adequate standard. The final bracket was called the lowest. A total of  parks within the council area were placed in this category by Playboard NI, who said the facilities currently offer a minimal level of play value.     Among the local parks listed in this lowest bracket are Stevenson Park, Fountain Hill, Currynierin, Rossdowney Drive, Hazelbank and Ballynagard. The Playboard NI report put forward a number of recommendations on how the local play facilities can be improved. Karen McPhillips, the councils Director of Environment and Regeneration, said they have started to consider the high level costs needed to improve local play facilities and how the funding can be secured. She said the cost would run to tens of millions of pounds. “We do need to think about how we are actually able to do that and the number of funding sources and cocktail funding that we have in the past been very successful at using to refurbish and develop play facilities and can continue to do so, she said. “The better the funding strategy and the more finances as a council we are able to both lever in and create through our own capital plan, the quicker we will be able to get through all of these.” It was agreed at the meeting that a detailed plan should be put together on the costs involved in upgrading the play facilities and brought before councillors later this year for approval.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two years ago, Derry City and Strabane District Council commissioned Playboard NI to carry out a detailed audit of all the play facilities available in the local area. The findings of the audit were outlined yesterday at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. The report found that more than a third of the  parks in council area were of a poor standard. This included the Currynierin park. Speaking at the meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Christopher Jackson said the details of the audit report highlighted the scale of the task that is in front of us all in relation to improving local play facilities. googletag.cmd.push He said he had a number of concerns, particularly in relation to areas of the Waterside. Cllr Jackson said many of the issues had been red-flagged for a considerableof time. He said a consultation had been carried out with the community in Currynierin and a new play facility had been designed for the area and taken through the planning process. He said the project has been spade-ready for a number of years but work has not started. “As a council we have built up expectation in the local community but we delivered absolutely nothing,” he said. “It is not good enough that we bring play facilities or schemes up to the stage where it is spade-ready and then it sits on a shelf.” googletag.cmd.push Cllr Jackson asked for a report to be prepared by council officers specically on the Currynierin park plans to show what funding opportunities have been explored and what barriers have been put in place in relation to the delay with the project. Cllr Jacksons comments were supported by Alliance councillor Philip McKinney who described the current play facilities in Currynierin as an absolute disgrace. Cllr McKinney said thatchildren from the area wanted to use good playing facilities they have to cross two busy roads to access a play park in Drumahoe. In response, Colin Kennedy, the councils Parks Development Manager, said that a funding application for the Currynierin park had been submitted to the Department of Justice but it had been unsuccessful.     He said a further application had been made to the Department of Communities for the necessary funding but added that bid had been left underdetermined. Mr Kennedy said they would bring back a comprehensive report on what has been done to date in relation to the proposed Currynierin park and what the next stages are. He added that there was a huge amount of work to be done on how the council is going to find the funding to deliver on all the proposed play schemes in the local area. DUP Alderman David Ramsey described the park at Rossdowney Drive in the Waterside as dangerous and said that what equipment remained needed to be removed and replaced. It was agreed at the meeting that a detailed plan should be put together on the costs involved in upgrading the play facilities and brought before councillors later this year for approval.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The call comes from Lilian Seenoi-Barr, from the North-West Migrants Forum, who was speaking after figures showed the Derry and Strabane district recorded the biggest increase in racist incidents in the North last year, as well as the second-largest increase in racist crimes. Speaking to the Derry News, Mrs Seenoi-Barr said: “Racism and hate crime instil fear into entire communities and undermine social cohesion. “We cannot allow such fundamental rights violations to persist at their current high levels. googletag.cmd.push “We need to have serious conversations about race and racism in Derry before it gets out of hand. “It is now time for Derry City and Strabane District Council to develop a local action plan to tackle racial inequalities and racism in Derry. “We also need political and religious leaders in the city to take a proactive approach to tackle racism and prejudice towards people of minority ethnic backgrounds. They cannot simply be bystanders. “Political will and leadership are vital to countering racism and hate crime. The opportunities enjoyed by both political and religious leaders to shape opinions and set agendas come with a responsibility to unequivocally denounce expressions of racism and related intolerance.” googletag.cmd.push Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Karen Mullan has said the new figures were very concerning. “There is no place for racism in our community. “It’s imperative on us all to work together as a society to stamp out racism and a build a more equal society free from discrimination. “All incidents of racism should be reported to and dealt with by the police.” On Monday, Mrs Seenoi-Barr was among a number of anti-racism groups who met with local councillors to discuss racism, sectarianism and anti-semitism. During the meeting, she told councillors that the Derry City and Strabane area had seen the largest increase in racist incidents between January  and December , adding that in her view it was fair to say we are going backwards in relation to racist incidents in the city.     Foyle SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin described the reported rise in racists in- cidents in Derry and Stra- bane as deeply disturbing.  She said: “In Derry we are proud to call ourselves a welcoming city but these statistics expose how that welcome does not always extend to all. “It is also incredibly worrying that so few victims actually receive justice. Of the  racist hate crimes recorded in Derry and Strabane policing area last year, outcomes such as charges or cautions were recorded in just four cases from April to December. “I suspect that these statistics only just scratch the surface. The PSNI must work to build trust with black and minority ethnic communities and ensure victims are adequately supported. That must be an urgent priority. “Every single one of us has a role to play in actively challenging racism, in all its forms, within our communities. These conversations arent always going to be easy or comfortable, but they are absolutely vitalwe are to stamp out racism and build a society in which everyone feels safe and respected.” Meanwhile, a UUP councillor on the local authority has apologised after making insensitive comments in relation to the Black Lives Matter movement during Mondays meeting. Alderman Derek Hussey said the Black Lives Matter movement was not fully inclusive, and added that this weeks meeting was addressing issues which go beyond Black Lives Matter However, in a statement issued by his party the following day, he said: “I apologise for my comments which were insensitive. “I was grateful for the opportunity to hear from those who presented and to expand my own understanding of racism in Northern Ireland. The Ulster Unionist Party opposes all forms of racism and we want to see hate crime legislation strengthened in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.       --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Fermanagh teenager signed from Irish Premiership side Ballinamallard until Thursday, July  and has played in all three of the Candystripes warm-up games so far. Glynn, who is in the first year of his Environmental Planning course at Queens University Belfast, has played under Declan Devine in the IFAs Club NI developmental pathway. In his early days, Micheaacutel played for Enniskillen Rangers before moving to Ballinamallard for the next six years, including two in the first team and being part of the squad beaten by Crusaders in the  Irish Cup Final. googletag.cmd.push “I was on the bench and disappointed not to get on, but nothing I can do,” Glynn points out. “I was playing soccer up to U with Club NI and Northern Ireland Us in the Euros. Whenever I got in to do my A-Levels, I didnt have as much time for soccer.” He is also a talented Gaelic footballer. His attacking prowess helped his school St Michaels Enniskillen to prestigious MacRory and Hogan Cup titles in . It attracted the attention of Fermanagh senior manager Ryan McMenamin, but Glynn turned down offers to join up with the Erne squad to concentrate on his soccer career. googletag.cmd.push “Declan got in contact with Ballinamallard manager Harry McConkey and I had worked with Declan through the IFAs Club NI system for a couple of years at U and U,” Glynn told The Derry News. “When he heard the Ballinamallard season was null and voided, he gave Harry a call to seeI would be interested in giving it a go until July. It was an open offer, so I couldnt turn it down and in July, Derry can either offer me a contact full time or I can go back to Ballinamallard.” Glynn joins other signings Marc Walsh, Will Patching, William Fitzgerald and Joe Hodge ahead of Derrys league opener, away to Longford next Saturday.     Just three days after his arrival at the Brandywell, Glynn played  minutes in the first game, a goalless draw against Bray, followed by another  minutes in a - draw with Finn Harps and half an hour last Sunday against Bohemians, another game ending goalless. “I have been training nearly every day, as much as I can. Im trying to get the minutes in because its been a while since I have played soccer,” points out Glynn, who hasnt featured since Ballinamallards pre-season. “At the minute, I am enjoying it and its going well so far,” he adds. At the minute, it involves a -mile round trip from his home in Derrygonnelly. “The team are training four mornings a week and Im in for all of them, it changes every week with the friendlies. I am in no set routine, but hopefully when the season starts Ill get into a routine and be more settled.” Glynn speaks of the buzz in the Derry camp, with the hopes of getting their season off to a winning start against Longford, who were promoted from the First Division after a - win over Shelbourne last season. “Its exciting, there is good hunger in the squad to succeed,” Glynn said of his progress so far. “I have played with a few of the lads before and they have been great and very welcoming. “It is a very young squad, there are a few lads who have been there and done that and they are setting a great example. Declan has been telling us to learn from them as best as you possibly can.” “For now, it is a matter of keeping pushing, keep the head down in training every day and see what comes of it. Hopefully things go well.” Derry lost - at Dundalk in last seasons opener and chase a first winning start since their - win at home to UCD in . In the last  seasons, the Candystripes have won their first game on four occasions, drew - with Shamrock Rovers in  and last the other five.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The redevelopment plan has the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades.News of progress to redevelop the town centre site comes after recent confirmation that the location is one of a number of high profile schemes included in a real estate portfolio designed to attract potential national and international developers and investors.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local councils which are part of the Belfast Region City Deal consortium and is hoping for a share of a near poundbn Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive investment package.As work to secure city deal funding continues, the local authorities which form the consortiumhave come together to launch a new portfolio of real estate development opportunities within their respective areas with the aim of attracting global investment, boosting tourism and creating sustainable regeneration.The Irish Street regeneration proposal is one of  schemes being showcased in the so-called Belfast Region Investment Guide which have been identied by the ious councils. The portfolio details potential uses for each site with the guide used to market the development opportunities to developers and investors, both locally and overseas.City Deal members say the compilation of the portfolio is the next step in the progression of the consortium with the overriding aim of creating more and better jobs and attracting investment.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure money from the city deal for a multi-million pound flagship tourism project in Newcastle, with the so-called Mournes Gateway proposal a series of ambitious projects which includes a gondola ride into the heart of the Mourne mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10Mar2021-Council.jpg","title":"Council 159% rates rises third lowest in province  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has imposed the third lowest rates rise in Northern Ireland.The above inflation .% hike to fund the local authorityrsquos poundm budget was unanimously agreed last week by local politicians who described the increase as ldquofair and balanced.New figures confirm that the rise was the the third lowest across the provincersquos  councils, while three local authorities mdash Antrim and Newtownabbey, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid Ulster mdash froze their district rate.The smallest increase of .% was made by Mid and East Antrim Council with the second lowest imposed by Fermanagh and Omagh Council mdash .%.With Newry, Mourne and Down in third spot in terms of the lowest increase, fourth place went to Derry City and Strabane Council which increased its rate by .%.Belfast City Council hiked rates by .%, while Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon sanctioned a .% rates rise.

Cars parks across the resort were full for most of the weekend.People who live in the resort are particularly concerned that with the deadly coronavirus still in circulation, such a large influx of visitors has implications for public health.Local politicians had also highlighted the need for people to continue exercising social distancing and adhering to public health advice, insisting that there was no room for complacency at this crucial time, despite and increase in positive Covid cases across the district and the roll-out of a comprehensive vaccination programme.Senior Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials had met with police ahead of another anticipated busy weekend in a bid to signicantly reduce the number of visitors, with council officials placing cones in the Tollymore and Bryansford areas, with others located at Carrick Little near Slieve Binnian and in the Mournes.In addition, police set up a number of rolling checkpoints on the main approach roads to Newcastle last weekend, with officers also deployed in the heart of the resort.Police also managed parking at the hugely popular Bloody Bridge area on the outskirts of the resort, expressing concern that some drivers had shown little care or attention for pedestrians or other road users by the way they had parked their vehicles, one of which was a Transit van.Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke, has praised the response from PSNI, local council, the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the emergency services and others for their response to managing visitors to main tourism hotspots.He said there was a greater presence on the ground which has been welcomed by residents following the ldquodangerous level of visitors who flocked to Newcastle and other ious parts of the district the previous weekend.ldquoI welcome the co-operation between all the ious agencies to improve the safety of residents, continued Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe local council placed traffic cones in a number of areas popular with visitors, while the PSNIhad vehicle checkpoints at main arterial routes into Newcastle area. There were also a number of mobile police patrols in the resort, with tickets issued to motorists for causing an obstruction at a number of areas including the Trassey Track and Bloody Bridge.Cllr Clarke said these measures helped ease the pressures on what he described as ldquonatural environmental treasurers as the district moves into the Covid recovery phase.He added: ldquoIt is clear that extra resources are required to manage and maintain our rights of ways, forests, beaches and our parks. The local council and PSNI will continue to share social media messaging on restricting travel to within  miles, with police confirming that they will continue to remain active across the entire district, not just Newcastle.Many people took to social media after another busy weekend to ask why visitors from outside the district who had travelled quite a few miles were not stopped and sent home.

So I started to think about what I could do and this is where the business came from.After  years of working with adults with learning disabilities, Louise came up with the idea of creating sensory boxes.ldquoRiley is registered blind and is deaf, so he needs a lot of sensory input. I came up with the idea of providing affordable sensory toys and products for children who need them, explained Louise.ldquoAs a special needs mum, I find thatyou go online to find sensory toys, they are hugely expensive.ldquoIrsquove spent four years buying stuff for Riley and I have a good idea of the things that you wouldnrsquot necessarily buy as a sensory product, but that will provide a similar sensory experience.ldquoI tailor my boxes to the child and find out about their sensory needs to determine what type of things would help them, such tactile items or fidget stuff to help with concentration and children who are hyperactive, or visually stimulating items such as light-up toys, calming products or growing products for a darkened room. There are so many sensory needs out there.Louise has been supported from the Go For It Programme in association with Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The programme is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth and Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Louise sells mostly through her Facebook page and word of mouth recommendations.ldquoI put up a post on Shop Ireland and I wasnrsquot really expecting the numbers of responses that I got. In the run-up to Christmas I had  orders. I had to turn people away, she explained.The support of the Go For It programme was a key part of the impetus to get the business up and running.The programme is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies and provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Louise joined the Go For It scheme through Down Business Centre and was able to access training.ldquoIt gave me the expertise in what to concentrate on first - I went and saw the accountant and got registered, she says.ldquoI was a bit apprehensive because I had absolutely no business experience, just a good idea. But the project gave me the reassurance that it was a good idea and we have put together a business plan.ldquoJoan OrsquoHara has helped me massively throughout the last few months and continues to be available for guidance should I need it or would recommend the best people to talk to in the subject I need.More recently, Louise has got her mum involved, branching out into making tactile and fidget cushions which are suitable for dementia patients and people with ADHD, autism and anxiety.Cllr Laura Devlin, chairwoman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council said: ldquoThe Go For It Programme provides new entrepreneurs with accessible, free and tailored support in the start-up stage of her business in areas such as financial and business planning, and sales and marketing to help get their business up and running.ldquoI wish Louise every continued success in developing and growing her enterprise and encourage anyone thinking about starting their own business to get in touch with the Go For It Programme.Joan OrsquoHara, business advisor at Down Business Centre added: ldquoItrsquos great to see Louise doing so well with a product that will undoubtedly support a childrsquos development through sensory play.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business contact the Go For It Programme on    or visit: www.goforitni.

While friends with John and Junior, Alan said he was also proud to have known their father very well.ldquoTo say that Jim was an acknowledged engineering genius is no overstatement, he continued.ldquoJim told me that he served his apprenticeship at Stewartrsquos Motor Works in Downpatrick before World War Two and thought the world of James Stewart whom he referred to as lsquogolden handsrsquo because he could turn his hand to anything.ldquoJim then worked for the former Ulster Transport Authority during the war and opened his Antrim Road Garage in Ballynahinch in late  which he purchased with a loan from a family friend.Alan also revealed that Jim and his son John sponsored him when he used to race cars.He continued: ldquoOnce Jim, or JN as he was known, started to help me with mechanical development, I quickly moved from being a back marker to a front runner in no amount of time.

It is intended that existing school campuses would be used ldquopending capital investment for a one site solution.The final decision on the way forward will be taken by Mr Weir who met via Zoom with a delegation of parents and St Patrickrsquos Grammar representatives last Wednesday.The Board of Governors at St Patrickrsquos is opposed to the merger, while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos are in favour of the plan going ahead.Members of St Patrickrsquos Board of Governors have urged parents, past pupils and the public to respond to the ongoing consultation, asserting that the outcome ldquowill have a lasting impact, not just in the school, with staff and pupils, but its ramications will be felt throughout the local community in East Down.The Board of Governors and school management say they do not believe the case has been made for the proposals as currently outlined and will be re-stating the reasons for this as part of the public consultation process and insist that they are focused on achieving the best outcomes for all concerned.De La Salle High School says the merger will ensure that families in the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority, while St Maryrsquos High insists that an all-ability school can cater for the gted and talented and also support children who need it.Mr Harvey said he was delighted to be able to secure the meeting with the education minister on behalf of St Patrickrsquos representatives and the ldquomany concerned parents who have contacted him on what he described as ldquothis important issue.He said has been working with them over recent days to ensure that their opposition to the current proposals is made clear to Department of Education officials.ldquoThese efforts culminated in last weekrsquos meeting with the education minister and served as a productive opportunity to enlighten him in respect of many of the key issues on the ground that, I believe, make the current amalgamation plans wholly unworkable, said Mr Harvey.ldquoThe plans, as proposed by CCMS, would reduce academic choice for parents and children from Downpatrick and the surrounding areas.ldquoIt would deny many Catholic schoolchildren the opportunity of attending a local selective Catholic grammar school and the proposed intake criteria would place children living in the rural areas beyond the urban Downpatrick area at a severe disadvantage in terms of the likelihood of being offered a place.Mr Harvey is also urging anyone who has views on the merger of the three Downpatrick schools to take part in the ongoing public consultation which closes on March

True to his word, he informed me right away, sayingPeter Scudamore could do it, so could he.The race saw  of the  entries go to post, with Frankie making the early running.

Photo: ITV Hub courtesy of Harpo Productions CBSWhy do we still have kings and queens and princes in the st century  Government of the people by the people for the people seems far preferable to the notion of inherited power and privilege. However, having watched this week’s royal shenanigans, I’ve changed my mind. I’m a convert. \"Rangers fans outside Ibrox stadium in Glasgow last weekend. Tim McGarry writes: \"It’s understandable the fans got a little exuberant winning the Scottish Premier League. But the Covid breaches were blatant. Thankfully Cltonville insist on keeping their fans safe by refusing to win the Irish League\"I’ve become a convinced royalist. A regal advocate. An upholder of pomp and circumstance. Why  \"The News Letter’s legal adviser — Mr J Bryson of Donaghadee. Scroll down to find out moreWell because the royal family have shown themselves to be top-class, A list entertainers. They are like the Kardashians but with fewer booty shots and more ermine. Fair enough, unlike the Windsors, we don’t actually have to pay for the Kardashians, but let’s give credit where it is due.We’ve endured a year of non-stop Covid news and anxiety-inducing briefings by Robin Swann and Michael McBride. But this week the entire nation temporarily forgot about the C word as the royal family delivered revelations, allegations and retaliations. There was a jaw-dropping family psycho-drama, a high class celebrity spat. Who made who cry  Who said what to whom  There was a potential constitutional crisis and best of all there was the most passive-aggressive use ever of the phrase “some recollections may y”.I must admit I have found the whole thing hilarious and an unprecedented and hugely welcome ersion from grim reality. TV audiences were huge. Clips, jokes and memes abounded on social media. Newspaper salesincreased dramatically – though as an aside, hats off to the Irish News who relegated the royal story to page  below more important stories like ‘GAA player likes playing GAA’.Some serious issues were of course raised by all these majestic antics. So people took to Twitter. And there, they debated racism, the legal precedents for assigning imperial titles to babies and Oprah Winfrey’s hairdo. And the discussions had all the high-minded depth, intellectual rigour and kind consideration of alternative views that you would expect from a medium that permits a maximum of  characters per tweet. So I say we keep the royals. If only for the entertainment value. And let’s face itwe scrapped the royal family and instead had an elected president, Brexit Britain would probably make it a toss-up between Nigel Farage and Piers Morgan. And no nation deserves that.Amidst all the allegations of institutional discrimination one thing was overlooked. As a CatholicI am unable to become King. The Act of Settlement of  still bars Papists like me from ascending the throne. I’ll be honest, this blatant block on my career prospects hadn’t particularly troubled me before. Frankly the number of princesses throwing themselves at me has been slightly less than the number of Catholics celebrating Rangers winning the Scottish Premier League . But it’s the principle that counts. So after completing this column I will immediately be writing to Oprah to demand my two hour interview.• The PSNI have launched an ‘investigation’ in to alleged breaches of the Covid regulations by celebrating Rangers fans on the Shankill Road this week. In line with similar investigations, Operation Look at the News Footage, should take about  months to complete, by which time Celtic may well have reclaimed the SPL, making any subsequent convictions of Rangers fans doubly painful. Rangers winning the SPL is of course a once in a decade event, so it’s understandable that their fans got a little exuberant. I should make it clear that whilst I am a football fan myself, I genuinely do not follow and have no interest whatsoever in Scottish football. As Kevin Bridges famously said “Scottish football is a two horse race, and we’ve now lost a horse”. But as a football fan I get it. I get why the team I like doing better than team you like in an annual competition leads to unbridled ecstasy. But the Covid breaches were pretty blatant and indefensible.Thankfully my local team Cltonville have insisted on keeping their fans safe from this sort of thing by steadfastly refusing to win the Irish League. • This is the first column I have ever written for the News Letter and I was delighted to be asked by the world’s oldest daily newspaper to be a contributor. But this is Northern Ireland so when I told a few people about the column I was lambasted by a nationalist friend for ‘taking the soup’. He assumed that as an avowed unionist paper I would be subject to censorship. Nonsense. As I told my friend the editorial procedure is very simple. Basically I write my article. It is then sent to Ben Lowry to make sure there are no Irish words in it. Next it is passed on to the News Letter’s legal adviser — Mr J Bryson of Donaghadee — before final approval by the editorial committee, better known as the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland. It is a damning indictment of a ided Northern Ireland that my friend almost believed me.• Tim McGarry’s column will appear bi weekly in the News Letter on Thursdays from March "},{"url":null,"title":"if brexit means that there must be a border somewhere then unionists should reluctantly accept a border poll now ","story":"Peter Robinson: Sinn Fein holds an airbrush in one hand and a halo in the other   Boris Johnson was prepared to cut NI loose, says ex-advisor to Theresa May – but we also failed Northern Ireland over BrexitNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingLocal BuysPuzzlesPublic NoticesNewsOpinionIf Brexit means that there must be a border somewhere, then unionists should reluctantly accept a border poll nowA letter from Mr RG McDowell:By RG McDowellFriday, th March , : pmUpdated Friday, th March , : pm  \"       \"  \"If unionism prevails in a poll then Northern Ireland’s position within the UK must be respected which means no internal UK borderThere seems to be a repeated narrative from ious English and European politicians thatthe Irish Sea border is to go a new border must go somewhere.Whilst in some ways it seems unbelievable that unionists need to provide the alternative rather than the focus being on minimising issues where the border actually exists let’s take on the unfortunate reality and accept the repeated calls for a border poll.

If nationalism wins then unionism must face the reality of a border with Britain not just in the sea but as a matter of fact. Such a referendum would have to be a once in a generation thing as a referendum every seven years isn’t a test of democracy but rather a war of attrition.The terms of such a referendum should be that another one couldn’t be held for another  years unless a majority of people in an assembly election voted for parties that were clearly designated as nationalist in which case it would be reasonable for a secretary of state to call a referendum at any time. The Good Friday Agreement is not compatible with an Irish Sea border. If the British, European and American governments want to respect the Good Friday Agreement and republicans want a border poll then let us have one in     on the understanding that the result will be respected unlike the result of the Brexit referendum which was not respected for the two-thirds of unionists in Northern Ireland who voted for the winning side.Mr RG McDowell, Belfast BT——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

When asked by the News Letter why anyone should trust him when he misled the public about the Irish Sea border by denying there would be any checks, the Prime Minister did not address the question. However, he said that “we undertook to have some checks to prevent some goods from Northern Ireland going into Ireland” but he didn’t want “loads of checks” from GB to NI.Mr Johnson also claimed that he had supported the protocol “because it seemed to me to uphold the principles of the UK internal market” but admitted that there is now “an imbalance in the way the protocol is operating so as to affect the balance of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement”.Read More Read MoreBrandon Lewis interview: Denial of the Irish Sea border is gone as SoS says part...When askedhe could commit to the government not banning from Northern Ireland items such as sausages and soil, Mr Lewis said: “Look, that is absolutely what we want to focus on. I want to be really clear about our position: The great British banger – there are obviously some phenomenal Northern Irish sausages as well, but I want to make sure thatyou want to be able to go to your local shop and experience the Norfolkbanger or a Melton Mowbray pork pie or whatever it is, that you can do that that’s got to be the aim.“My position and the government’s position in terms of the grace period we’ve got for chilled meats at the moment is not that at the end of that grace period there is a clf edge it’s that we use the grace period to get a permanent solution to ensure that those products can continue to flow.”Last week the government announced a series of unilateral extensions to grace periods which delay parts of the Irish Sea border from being implemented. However, in that flurry of announcements it was largely missed that there was no end date associated to the reversal of what had been a total ban on British soil being imported, evena few particles were on a plant’s roots.One of the few people to notice that was former Ukip member Richard North, who wrote on his blog that the decision was dferent “in that it deliberately sets aside a provision on Union law listed in Annex  of the NI Protocol, which the UK government has agreed should apply to Northern Ireland”. Even though it was described as a “temporary operational measure”, and Downing Street had said it was part of “temporary, practical arrangements”, he highlighted that there was no end date.Last week’s guidance states: “Bulbs or vegetables that have been grown in soil can be sent from GB to NI eventhey still have soil attached.“Plants can be moved to NI with soil and other growing media attached, provided they are from an authorised business meeting GB plant passporting requirements for soil.”Other new red tape such as customs declarations remains.When askedthat decision was simply a grace period – delaying the inevitable – or was a permanent decision which will not be overturned, Mr Lewis said that the government had issued “a further guidance paper it’s not actually a grace period, so it sets out the arrangements for moving plants, vegetables, bulbs, machinery... they have soil attached.“But it’s not a grace period it’s a guidance piece so that is our guidance that is not a time-limited issue no.”When it was put to him that businesses such as plant nurseries need certainty that this is the law and it won’t be changing, he said: “Yes, and that’s why we’ve been able to issue the guidance on that. It still recognises the robust arrangements, so we don’t compromise biosecurity, etc, with the single epidemiological unit of the island of Ireland, but yes, that is our guidance, that is the position.“That point about certainty was also really behind the timing of the decisions last week because of what businesses were saying to us and confirmed after we took that decision that we had to do that to give them certainty for the weeks ahead, not just the months ahead.”:Sam McBride: Northern Ireland is now a proxy battleground for the EU and the UK – and that is dangerousTUV leader Jim Allister’s aide had messages between Jamie Bryson and Sinn Féin, court toldUnder cross-examination from loyalist Jamie Bryson, libel lawyer Paul Tweed refuses to name five Nama case clientsSam McBride: After darkness, light: Reasons for real hope as Northern Ireland vaccine rollout accelerates – but first expect political rowsBoris Johnson backs down as EU says no to demands to reduce Irish Sea border – and DUP says ask for more checks, not lessTwo thirds of GB retailers plan to stop selling to Northern Ireland by April because of Irish Sea border, survey findsUnionist leaders unite to go to court over Irish Sea border, arguing it breaches the  Act of Union and  Belfast AgreementSam McBride: Northern Ireland is in a breathtakingly undemocratic position which dishonest Boris Johnson knows is indefensible – yet he knowingly chose itSam McBride: Read the small print – the Irish Sea border may be impossible to remove, evenMLAs vote it downSam McBride: Shackled to Brexit, Arlene Foster can’t admit that it has been disastrous for Union – but Irish Sea border is radically reshaping NI——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But the encounter moved into territory which reveals something far more profound about this government’s thinking about the Northern Ireland Protocol which creates that internal UK trade frontier.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Just  hours after the new border began, Mr Lewis tweeted to say: “There is no ‘Irish Sea Border’”. Ever since, that tweet has hung like a millstone around Mr Lewis’s political neck.It was not a momentary slip. Rather, it was part of a strategy by him – on behalf of the government – to minimise the reality of the protocol.Perhaps reassured by the fact that Arlene Foster was in this period making clear that she had given up the political fight to prevent the creation of border control posts, the NIO had in October said on its official Twitter account in response to an article I had written: “There will be no border in the Irish Sea between GB  NI. The NI Protocol explicitly prevents the creation of one....”Alex Thomas from the Institute for Government later cited that tweet as an example of “increasing abuse of official communications”, and highlighted that government Twitter accounts “are funded by the taxpayer for the purpose of informing the public – not misleading them”.Given the scale of the new red tape – which is not yet being experienced in all its bureaucratic glory – I ask Mr Lewishe regrets what he said. It’s an obvious question, and Mr Lewis clearly has a prepared answer, saying that “it is a tweet that hasn’t stood the test of time as well as I would have hoped”.He frames it as somethingwhich essentially he believed at the time, with the government “looking to do the protocol in a way that consumersin Northern Ireland effectively wouldn’t see it, wouldn’t feel it, wouldn’t have an issue with it clearly that is not the lived experience on the ground and that is why we’ve taken measures over the last couple of months with the EU and obviously we took the measures unilaterally last week.”I ask himhe now believes that there is no Irish Sea border. He doesn’t answer, saying instead that “my focus is on getting to a position where consumers don’t have any impact in terms of having a dferential, in terms of the experience they have as a UK citizen in Northern Ireland as opposed tothey’re UK citizens anywhere , so that there is no real border at all – that’s got to be the aim”.Implicitly that accepts that there is now a border, but he goes on to say that his real aim is for Northern Ireland to “have a huge competitive advantage without any disadvantages, as an integral part of the UK”.Mr Lewis is mild-mannered, but there is an unmistakably bullish tone to many of his comments. He presents grace periods now not being for industry to adapt to bans and find alternative suppliers in the EU – as they once were presented –but for negotiating those bans out of existence.Whatthe EU says no  That hoary staple of ministerial answers – “I don’t like getting into hypotheticals” – is deployed, but he effectively does make clear that this is going to happen, eventhe EU objects, saying “We want to do this with the EU we want to find a way that works. With a bit of goodwill, we can work through that.“But ultimately, the Prime Minister has been clear – we want to ensure that the great Norfolk sausage or Melton Mowbray pork pie can be enjoyed anywhere in the UK, including Belfast.”Read More Read MoreBan on British soil entering Northern Ireland is over for good, says NI Secretar...He lampoons the EU thinking that chilled sausages need to be banned from Northern Ireland to protect their single market, saying “I personally don’t think that the great British banger is a greatthreat to the single market of the EU and I’m not sure that the risk of somebody smuggling a Norfolk sausage from Belfastto Dublin for sale is the biggest threat out there. So I’m cautiously optimistic we’ll get a mutually agreeable solution.”Butthe government doesn’t want the terms of the protocol to apply, why did it sign up to it Unconvincingly, he says: ”Well, one of the reasons there was a grace period was to get the permanent solution sorted out because it is complicated due to their single market issues and the phytosanitary check issues – we’ve got to use that to solve that problem permanently not as a clf-edge suddenly later in the year [where] you can’t source those products [form] wherever in the UK you want to.”The interview is suffused with the idea that the government thought the protocol would allow an unimpeded flow of GB goods into NI, despite the clear terms of what it agreed and its own assessments that there would not be an unimpeded flow.It is understandable why the EU is sceptical about this explanation, believing that Mr Johnson knew precisely what he was doing – and it was spelt out in detail to his negotiator, Lord Frost – during thelong talks.In the Commons on Wednesday, Mr Lewis said: “I am determined, as the Prime Minister is, to ensure that the great British banger...will continue to be enjoyed by those who wish to do so across the counties of Northern Ireland in perpetuity.”The words “determined” and “in perpetuity” seem to commit the government to permanently disregarding the EU’s ban on chilled meat products such as sausages and pies coming from GB to NI.When askedthe government was prepared to act unilaterallythe EU refuses to agree to that, Mr Lewis is vague, saying: “Our focus is on finding a solution that means they can be enjoyed in perpetuity. “We’re prepared to do that but George Eustice and the team at DEFRA are working with the EU on that, the Cabinet Office team lead on the protocol to get the solution to that. The Prime Minister has been clear – he wants that solution so that we find a way forward. I’ll not be drawn on what may or may not happen because I’m optimistic that we’ll get a mutually agreeable solution.”But we are clear: People in Northern Ireland are part of the United Kingdom they should be able to enjoy products from across the United Kingdom in the same way they wouldthey were living in Cardf, Edinburgh or Great Yarmouth.”It’s an answer which seems to logically commit the UK to unilaterally acting in multiple areas, regardless of what the EU thinks.There has been debate, and conflicting briefingfrom dferent parts of government, as to whether Boris Johnson is trying to radically renegotiate – even tear up – the protocol, or whether he is committed to fully implementing it.Mr Lewis frames the government’s unilateral move last week in line with the latter category – that it was necessary to act urgently to shore up support for the deal: “If we had not taken those actions last week, I think the protocol would be potentially fatally flawed in the next few weeks.”He says that “supermarkets and others were saying to me... that we would have had some empty shelves again in the next couple of weeks not in April – because of their lead times it would have come arguably next week maybe this week, but probably next week”.In that situation, he says that the News Letter and other media outlets “would, quite rightly, have been writing about it and showing images of that as another problem with the protocol”.Even some subsequent agreement with the EU to extend the grace periods would not have resolved the immediate problem, he says, “and that would have been an untenable position”.Mr Lewis says that he had told Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney that “ we hadn’t taken these actions last week, we’d have been in a really dficult position for the protocol – and actually, it’s in everybody’s interests, particularly actually I would say the Irish government and the EU...that we find a way to make sure the protocol works”.He said that the protocol “has to work for all communities – and at the minute it’s not really working for any because whether you’re nationalist or unionist or someone who doesn’thave a constitutional view, as a consumer you are affected by the protocol...there is obviously on top of that, and I recognise this, an issue for unionists who feel that there is an impact on identity and I get that, I absolutely get that. I appreciate that some of them would like the protocol torn up, etc.“I might not agree with the outcome they want, but I understand why they feel that way. One of the ways we’ve got to do with our partners,you like, the EU – and the Irish government have a part to play in this – is to make sure that they do understand thatthe protocol is going to survive and work, it gets to that place where a consumer doesn’t notice it and Northern Ireland has this huge competitive advantage of being able to trade as part of the EU and freely with the EU - which would be a phenomenal competitive opportunity.“For that to work, the protocol’s got to work for all communities – the whole community. I think sometimes there is a risk that some people forget, to be frank, or don’t realise, that the Good Friday Belfast Agreement has the east-west strand it’s important that it’s not one strand, it’s three strands...”The Secretary of State says he wants to see the EU spending more time engaging with people in Northern Ireland, noting pointedly that European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic had met US representativesthis week “who are not party to any of this”.Mr Lewis said that Mr Sefcovic “is a straight guy” and he believed he would ensure that happened, but thus far there was little evidence of it developing.Looping back to where we started, I put it to Mr Lewis that politicians rarely say they regret anything. Does he regret his claim that there was no Irish Sea border “That tweet has not stood the test of time very well and you’ve got to try to learn from those experience you’ve got to fall down a bit to know how to get back up...I’ll make sure that I’m bearing those issues in mind when I tweet in the future.”It seems clear that he does regret it, but he just can’t quite bring himself to say that - a stance in keeping with so many other politicians’ claims about Brexit which were delivered with iron certainty, but haven’t stood the test of time.:Sam McBride: Northern Ireland is now a proxy battleground for the EU and the UK – and that is dangerousTUV leader Jim Allister’s aide had messages between Jamie Bryson and Sinn Féin, court toldUnder cross-examination from loyalist Jamie Bryson, libel lawyer Paul Tweed refuses to name five Nama case clientsSam McBride: After darkness, light: Reasons for real hope as Northern Ireland vaccine rollout accelerates – but first expect political rowsBoris Johnson backs down as EU says no to demands to reduce Irish Sea border – and DUP says ask for more checks, not lessTwo thirds of GB retailers plan to stop selling to Northern Ireland by April because of Irish Sea border, survey findsUnionist leaders unite to go to court over Irish Sea border, arguing it breaches the  Act of Union and  Belfast AgreementSam McBride: Northern Ireland is in a breathtakingly undemocratic position which dishonest Boris Johnson knows is indefensible – yet he knowingly chose itSam McBride: Read the small print – the Irish Sea border may be impossible to remove, evenMLAs vote it downSam McBride: Shackled to Brexit, Arlene Foster can’t admit that it has been disastrous for Union – but Irish Sea border is radically reshaping NI——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Itrsquos quite unbelievable for a small town to have such a big connection, and I think it needs to be celebrated more.As lockdown hit last March, so did all of Incurzionrsquos events, which kept Mr King busy every week.He believes musicians have been ignored throughout the pandemic, which he worries may have caused a mental health crisis in the industry.ldquoAs live events go wersquove been absolutely decimated, he said. ldquoThe financial impact of that on venues and on companies like ours, as well as inidual musicians, has been unbelievable.ldquoBut fortunately for us our digital sales have been through the roof. That might be because people have more time on their hands at home to explore dferent genres, and itrsquos great they feel they want to purchase our music.ldquoBut the major thing for this industry is the live events, wersquore nothing without those, just like every other label and performer.ldquoThe funding has been awful, and the impact this will have on mental health seems largely ignored.ldquoThis is what we do every single week, and to have that stripped away from you for so long is dficult. Itrsquos also our place to network, so to not have that space will have long-term ramications.ldquoI know venues in Cardf that have had next to no support, andit carries on you canrsquot see how theyrsquod survive.With cases going down by the week, he hopes the music industry will be able to start up just in time for those venues and for musicians.ldquoWersquore obviously very eager to get back to le as it was, and to pick up where we left off.To find out more about Penarthrsquos Incurzion Audio, visit https:www.incurzionaudio Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is a welcome piece of good news for the area.”Councillor Ciaran Toman askeda safety barrier had been considered for users of the park and his question was answered by Alderman Twyble who informed him there was a one-way system in operation and the paths keep people separatefrom vehicles.Councillor Declan McAlinden said the redevelopment of this play park would be an “excellent addition to what is already there”.and proposed the recommendation to approve the planning application.This proposal was seconded by Alderman Twyble and the committee voiced its agreement.Call for action over troubled GP Practice - read hereEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
