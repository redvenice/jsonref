When did we forget that?” Carlson’s guest, the virologist and anti-vaxxer Robert Malone, said: “Apparently about a year ago, I think yesterday” – a reference to Biden’s inauguration on 20 January 2021 – “was when we must have forgotten that, although Mr Biden prior to his election made clear statements that he wasn’t going to force vaccination.” Carlson is vastly influential, commanding huge audiences in primetime.

The passengers were on a flight from Brisbane carrying 73 people, all of whom were fully vaccinated and had tested negative for Covid-19 before departure.  Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata’afa warned the government may cancel further flights from Australia. In neighbouring American Samoa, the local governor announced the cancellation of flights between the territory and Samoa for one week.

The WHO said epidemiological trends continue to show “a decoupling” between recorded case numbers, hospital admissions and deaths, compared with previous waves driven by other variants, which is likely to be the result of a combination of Omicron being milder, and the fact the vaccines are more effective at protecting against serious illness than they are against infection.  But the brief added: Another 3,476 confirmed cases of the virus have also been logged in the last 24-hour reporting period. On Saturday, 19,371 new Covid cases were registered, 278 less than the previous day. On Friday, the country reported a record 19,649 new daily cases. Covid-19 vaccinations for children aged between 5 and 11 years are scheduled to start on 26 January, according to Valeriu Gheorghita, the coordinator of the national vaccination campaign.  The government is trying to combat vaccine hesitancy in the population by posting personal accounts of people who have taken up the vaccine offer on social media. As of Friday, 7.9 million people out of a population of around 19 million have been fully vaccinated, according to the government’s vaccine task force.If there’s anything you’d like to flag, you can message me on Twitter @JedySays or drop me an email.Describing how NHS teams “stop at nothing to make sure that our country is protected”, Dr Nikki Kanani, a GP and deputy lead for the NHS Covid vaccination programme, told reporters about a person with additional learning needs who was given a jab at home in a hot tub. Kanani said there had been “incredible stories” of people taking up a dose after being given “an approach that is just much more tailored for them”. She said that while most people were able to get vaccinated at their local pharmacy, at centre or by their general practice team, “for others it’s a little bit more complicated”.  “I’m so proud of our teams, for example in Portsmouth where they’ve gone out and vaccinated people with quite complex health needs,” the GP said. “One inidual was vaccinated at home in his hot tub because he has additional learning needs and it was a way of making sure that he felt safe and secure as he got his vaccination. Our teams stop at nothing to make sure that our country is protected.”About 3.7 million people in England are classified as clinically extremely vulnerable, many of whom feel like a “forgotten minority” as the country axes plan B restrictions.

The news comes as the country reported 20,507 Covid new cases, 108 deathsand 467 patients admitted to hospital with the virus.  The BA.2 sub-variant, of which 426 cases have been sequenced in the UK, may have an “increased growth rate” over the earlier form of Omicron, officially designated as BA.1, according to UKHSA. The public health body stressed, however, that there is a “low level of certainty early in the emergence of a variant”.

Thanks in advance.All NHS staff in England who have direct contact with patients must have had their first dose of a Covid vaccine by 3 February, and have had two jabs by 1 April, or risk losing their job at the end of March - a government policy unions fear will worsen the health service’s staffing crisis. Kanani was asked if the NHS could cope with the possibility of losing thousands of staff over mandatory vaccination.  Pressed on whether patients would suffer if the NHS were to lose staff over vaccine mandate, she said:  The country’s constitutional council approved strict new restrictions for unvaccinated people on Friday. The new law will exclude them from large parts of public life via a “vaccine pass” that will be introduced from Monday.  People in France have to show proof of vaccination or recovery if they want to gain entry to hospitality venues, cultural sites and sporting events or use long-distance public transport.  Other measures are to be gradually relaxed from February, however, because the French prime minister, Jean Castex, believes the country’s high vaccination rate will protect hospitals from becoming overwhelmed.

Photograph: iStockTJ Malone points to hoops of pristine white cable hanging from telegraph posts as he drives up a narrow boreen near Blessington, Co Wicklow, with grass growing in the middle of the road.The cables are a sign that this sparsely populated rural district will soon be connected to superfast broadband: “It’s a massive task,” says Malone, who is in charge of delivering on the promises made by National Broadband Ireland, the company responsible for the project.“It gets right down into every single village, every single home and any peninsula, including the islands,” says Malone about a project that will eventually cover all the parts the State – 96 per cent of the total landmass, in fact – where subsidies are need to make broadband delivery possible.With State funding of up to €2.6 billion in play, it’s big money. Private investors have pledged €175 million and additional sums if needed that would bring the total to €223 million. So far, the investors have paid in €120 million, including€20 million of it in December.There is no shortage of critics but NBI, whose chairman is Irish-American businessman David McCourt, is confident that it can complete the job under budget.Work has begun on supplying 151,000 homes and businesses. In time, it will rise to cover 554,000 locations – connecting the residences of 1.1 million people, 54,000 farms and 44,000 businesses in a system that will be seen on virtually every metre of every rural road.Fibre-optic cables stretching for 146,000km will go overhead for 89,494km – connecting 1.47 million telegraph poles, and those cables will run underground for 15,057km. And all of this is being done with the promise that the service will be “future-proofed” for 25 years, and capable of being expanded by a quarter.Despite complaints about the pace of the rollout, work is now under way in each of the 26 counties. In Dublin, some of the vast industrial estates at Ballymount on the city’s highly-developed western edges have been included.Strange as it may seem, such locations are not deemed commercially viable by market operators, thus bringing “rural broadband” within the bounds of the M50 motorway around the capital, in sight of the Red Cow roundabout.The delivery of broadband offshore is a different challenge entirely. A symbolic moment looms in coming weeks when the NBI system goes live on in four small Atlantic islands: Collanmore, Co Mayo and the Donegal islands of Eighter, EadarinisInishcoo and Rutland.Rural depopulationIf successful, it will be the spearhead of efforts reverse generations of rural depopulation, as important in the 21st century as rural electrification was in its day, reviving sleepy towns and villages of the countryside.Rural broadband was needed before 2019. But the pandemic has changed the way people think and the rise in demand for working from home requires superfast broadband to make it a reality.“The social and economic development of rural Ireland is integral to the wellbeing of our country as a whole and to our quality of life. Ireland’s economy, heritage and culture is heavily dependent on the contribution of rural areas,” said a Government policy document last year.“The availability of high-speed broadband services in rural communities will have a transformative effect, even in the most remote parts of the country. It will ensure equality of access to online services for people in rural areas.“It will create potential for improved social cohesion and economic growth and will allow people to pursue their careers without the need to relocate, as well as offering the potential to attract new people and businesses to rural locations.”If all of that points to pressure on National Broadband Ireland to get the rollout right, the project has proved contentious. Government approval in 2019 for the came in the face of forceful resistance from the Department of Public Expenditure. The Department opposed it on grounds of cost, affordability, value-for-money and Exchequer risks and it expressed concern that the State will not own the network once it is built.In addition, TDs and Senators are unhappy with coronavirus lockdown delays that left the project six months behind schedule. More recently still, the company and the Government dismissed outright media claims that an investment hedge fund had quietly taken a majority stake in the project, insisting there was no ownership change at all.“Bringing a private company on board to actually build it was the right decision,” insists Peter Hendrick, chief executive of National Broadband Ireland.Asked about criticism that the deal is too favourable to private investors, he points to “clawbacks” that give the Government a share of any savings on construction costs and an upside share of NBI revenues above certain targets.“The protection mechanisms they have in terms of clawbacks will provide all of the comforts that actually there isn’t an unlimited win here for shareholders,” he says.“Because the tender process went on for so long there’s very little ambiguity and every single scenario has been thought of. I would say the biggest winners here are probably all the law firms.”Technical complexityIn chilly Blessington this week, workers were busily installing 571km of cable to connect 5,006 premises in the area that do not already have broadband.Although the expansive lakes nearby and the imposing Wicklow mountains in the distance make for striking scenery, they add to the technical complexity of connecting the hinterland of a bustling country town that is near enough to Dublin to be in the city commuter belt. The number of premises ranks among the largest for connection by NBI in a single area, but Midleton in Co Cork will the biggest.The work now under way in Blessington is but the final part of a project in which everything has to be worked out in advance.“You don’t know until you dig,” says Aidan McWeeney, a national broadband worker who seems to know every single manhole in the Blessington area. “These are areas that haven’t been touched in decades unless there was a damaged cable. So it’s a huge unknown.”The planning includes route maps into inidual homes and schedules for tree-clipping to make way for cables overhead. The need for detailed records means that each tree is photographed, before and after the cuts, meaning NBI has thousands of pictures of trees on file.All told, surveyors examined more than 20,000 Blessington “assets” before any construction work started on the ground. The aim was to set out what exactly needed to be done at each site, quantify the materials required, identify any environmentally or archaeologically sensitive sites and ascertain the wayleaves and consents needed to traverse private and public property.It turns out that numerous homes in the area could not be connected without an agreement with the ESB to run cable along a bridge it owns near Poulaphouca reservoir. “Until we get access there we can’t finish out the 1,000 premises we need to do. Most of work will be done to it and it’s a case of just getting that done,” Malone says.Similar consents were required from CIÉ for 600 rail crossings around the State. Work cannot be done on national roads without the approval of Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the consent of local authorities is needed to work on other roads. That can take up to 12 weeks, eating further into precious time.Then there is the unpredictable. In spite of all the effort to start installing cable in Blessington, someone took a chainsaw to a row of six poles on one roadway. The matter is with the Garda.Progress has also been hampered by procedural “teething” problems. Malone tells how, in the early days of the project, NBI encountered a rejection rate “in the region of 40 per cent” when applying to some local authorities for licences to erect inidual telegraph poles. That “tortuous” system has since been streamlined, but it took practically a year to establish new guidelines to speed the process and boost predictability.“You pick up these learnings in the first year-and-a-half of a project,” he adds, arguing that the tricky groundwork done in the early enables the project to “snowball” as momentum builds later. “We spent two years to get 37,000 premises built and in the next three months we’ll get another 25,000 built.”The aim by the end of this year is to have the build completed at 127,000 premises, with the build commenced on 220,505 premises, and surveys complete for more than 380,000 premises.Making up for lost groundA couple years into the project, NBI is now in a race to make up ground lost during the first lockdown.The closure of hotels and other services interrupted NBI’s ability to carry out physical surveys of remote townlands, or to examine poles and cables. Only then could it be established what remedial work and new network infrastructure was required.The disruption was like heavy snowfall, says Malone, very real, but very quickly forgotten by those demanding faster action: “In the early stages of this we had guys who were travelling all around the country who had to go home at night. Then you had contractors who weren’t mobilised because they couldn’t get even facilities for somebody on the road to go to the loo. It’s as simple as that.”NBI has not been hit with financial penalties for missing targets, thanks to “reliefs” for the impact of communicable diseases. When the contract was drawn up, the fear was that something like foot-and-mouth could occur. Nobody then thought, or knew anything about, a pandemic such as Covid-19.But with coronavirus still not beaten and many broadband contractors absent this month because of omicron close contacts, the upshot of it all is that NBI now finds itself without any time to lose. Still, Hendrick insists the job can still be finished by its original 2026 deadline.After the Government pressed last year to accelerate the project, could the job yet be done by 2025? “We still have a chance,” Hendrick replies. “We’ll get it in on seven years if we’re aiming for something less and our objective is to aim for six.”There’s promotions happening now. So we would see the take-up being considerably higher than where we would have thought it was a couple of years ago.”But there are mountains still to climb. As of January 7th, the grand total of premises using the NBI service was 5,122. That number will have to grow and grow and grow for years to come.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"f%C3%B3rsa trade union seek assurances over return to workplace","story":"The new Covid guidance envisages a return to physical attendance in workplaces for many staff who have been working remotely since March 2020.

It is one of the priority prices of legislation, which will be prioritised in this first two sessions of the Dáil.”Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Saturday with Katie Hannon, Minister Rabbitte said that she is anxious to see legislation in relation to remote working pass, as it can improve work life balance and also create more work opportunities for people with a disabilities.Sinn Féin TD, David Cullinane, said if there is government and opposition consensus on the issue, the legislation should pass quickly. “This is about choice.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"holohan sets out rationale for lifting of almost all covid 19 restrictions","story":"Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said there was ‘clear evidence’ nationally and internationally that the Omicron Covid-19 variant was associated with a ‘significantly reduced’ level of severe disease. Photograph:  Colin KeeganCollinsCovid-19 cases were towards the most pessimistic projections during the Omicron wave of the pandemic but serious clinical outcomes were “much less than expected”, the Chief Medical Officer has said.In his letter to the Government recommending the lifting of all restrictions, Dr Tony Holohan said there was “clear evidence” nationally and internationally that the variant is associated with a “significantly reduced population level of severe disease despite continuing high levels of transmission”.Omicron, which emerged in December, now accounts for 97 per cent of all Covid-19 infections in Ireland and has led to record numbers of cases.However, Dr Holohan observed that the “overall epidemiological position is improving, and the most recent data indicates that we have now passed a peak in this wave of infection”.UnderestimationThere were 375,000 PCR confirmed cases between December 30th and January 19th and 25,635 positive antigen tests uploaded to the HSE system, but even the 400,000 cases were a vast underestimation of the numbers infected.Dr Holohan said at the peak of infections there were two to three times as many cases as was reported. This would equate to between 800,000 and 1.2 million people being infected with Omicron recently.But hospital admissions of people with Covid-19 remained stable, peaking at 1,063 on January 10th and then falling below 900 as the average number of newly confirmed cases fell.Despite record case numbers, the number of patients in intensive care (ICU) peaked at 126 on November 23rd before the Omicron surge and fell to 73 on January 18th. Approximately half of confirmed cases in ICU are unvaccinated.Transmission opportunitiesCase numbers are decreasing at an average of 6 per cent per day at present, but Dr Holohan anticipated that they may rise again.“As case numbers and numbers in hospital decline and the threat recedes, population mobility and social contact will increase, creating additional opportunities for viral transmission, a process which may be accelerated by an increase in social contacts following the relaxation of restrictions. Infections and detected cases may then stabilise or start to increase,” he wrote.However, Dr Holohan said the level of immunity in the community as a result of infection and the booster vaccination programme should ensure that rising case numbers will not result in a high levels of “serious disease or an unsustainable demand on healthcare”.In addition to recommending the lifting of almost all restrictions, Nphet stated that there is no longer any justification for a curtailment of health services such as community day services.Nphet will review the impact of the lifting of restrictions on February 17th.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"total of 100 000 covid vaccines expire amid slowing demand ministers told","story":"There is an estimated uptake of between 40 per cent and 66 per cent for booster vaccinations in the 18-49 age group, Cabinet  told. Photograph: Alan BetsonMinisters have been told that 100,000 Covid-19 vaccines expired in the last week amid slowing demand for vaccines, with up to half a million set to go out of date in the next fortnight unless demand increases.While 2.6 million booster doses have been administered in recent weeks as part of an accelerated rollout, Cabinet was warned today that there has been a “significant slowing” in demand for boosters in recent weeks, especially among younger people.The doses that are set to expire were given out to GP surgeries, pharmacies and mass vaccination centres during December.There is an estimated uptake of between 40 per cent and 66 per cent in the 18-49 age group, Cabinet was told. This is despite a range of efforts to drive uptake rolled out in recent weeks, which will be redoubled in the coming days even amid widespread relaxation of restrictions.These include targeted measures aimed at areas with poor uptake, and specific regional advertisements. An immunocompromised vaccine campaign is also to be launched, while further pop-up GP clinics in third-level institutions are being planned.ChildrenMeanwhile, Ministers were told that 23 per cent of five- to 11-year-olds have been registered to date for their vaccine, with 80,000 out of an estimated population of 482,000 having received their first dose.However, the rate of registration has also slowed among this age group in the last week. As reported this week by The , the expectation is now that this phase of the booster programme will extend into April – perhaps even longer, with the efforts to drive uptake among those who were diagnosed with Covid from mid-December onwards.These people are currently not advised to seek a booster shot, until they are three months past their diagnosis. The Cabinet was told that this phase will be “both complex and expensive to deliver” with further risk that vaccines will go off, thanks to volatile levels of weekly demand for shots and differing geographic access to vaccines.Ireland has among the highest rates of vaccine penetration among its adult population, with 94.8 per cent of adults having completed their primary vaccine course. The country is third in Europe in terms of booster vaccine rollout.Travelling difficultiesSeparately, tens of thousands of people could face additional difficulties in travelling overseas from the start of next month, as their digital Covid cert will not be accepted anymore.Cabinet was told today that almost 45,000 people have a primary vaccination certificate that will expire by February 1st, but who have not yet received a booster or a had a recent Covid infection confirmed by a PCR test.From that date, people must have had a booster or confirmed Covid infection within the last nine months in order to be eligible for a digital Covid cert. While travel within the EU is, strictly speaking, allowed without a cert, it can be arduous and complex.Among the 45,000 people will be a certain number who died since receiving their second shot, but many more may have been caught out by a quirk of testing rules introduced as the State’s PCR capacity was exhausted out over Christmas.Under those rules, people aged between four and 39 were asked to take regular antigen tests before booking a PCR test, and in many instances would not have received a confirmed PCR test result.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"In one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"britain must stand firm against russian aggression","story":"When the Soviet Union collapsed, Britain, Russia and the United States made a solemn agreement with Ukraine. In exchange for giving up its inheritance of the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world, Ukraine’s security was to be guaranteed and its independence would be respected.Ukraine has kept its end of the deal. Vladimir Putin has not. Russia has annexed Crimea, provided support for separatist conflict in Donbas and massed 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border. In doing so, it has committed repeated acts of aggression, provocation and interference.It is not enough for Western politicians to talk about the importance of our values. When they are tested, we must support our allies. Not only does Labour understand the threat posed by Putin’s Russia, we stand resolute in our support of Ukrainian sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. I made that clear to the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK this week.The situation on the Ukrainian border is an attempt by Putin to re-establish Russian force as a means of dominance over parts of Europe. And it is a direct threat to the anti-imperialist principle that sovereign nations are free to choose their own allies and their own way of life. That is why it is crucial that parties in Westminster are united in opposing Russian aggression. I’ve been critical of the chaos at the heart of the UK Government. But I must commend the work of the Secretary of State for Defence, Ben Wallace, on this matter. He has worked hard to bring people together, written with moral clarity on the nature of Russian aggression and ensured that the UK continues to support Ukraine\u0027s ability to defend itself through military aid. These bilateral measures are important but if we are serious about repelling the Russian threat we will need a more united approach on an international level. This is where I believe the Government must step up and lead. Divisions within Nato have emboldened Putin. For too long the implicit message to Moscow has been that Putin can do what he likes and the West will do little to retaliate. We must continue to explore diplomatic routes to avoid conflict. But Russian demands that Ukraine give up its desires to join Nato and the EU should not be entertained. Nobody envisages British and allied troops being dragged into war. But we need to work with allies to use our collective resources, including sanctions, to show Russia the actions it takes will have consequences. For Britain and our allies this will mean taking tough decisions. Europe’s over-reliance on Russian energy supplies must be addressed. And here in Britain there has been a failure to rid our economic and political systems of the money used to fund and support the Putin regime. We cannot go on being the world’s laundromat for illicit finance. First, we must lift the veil on the true nature of ownership of property and other assets in the UK. That requires a registration of overseas entities bill. Second, we need reform of Companies House. There is no reason for ownership to be hidden behind layer after layer of shell companies whose only purpose is to obscure the facts from public view. Third, the Government must act on the recommendations in the intelligence and security committee’s Russia report. That means dealing with shortcomings in the unexplained wealth order regime and for a register of members of the Lords or Commons who serve on the boards of overseas companies.Fourth, we must ensure that the elections bill going through parliament requires political donations to be transparent, and to come from money generated in a legitimate fashion. To reinforce all this, Labour has announced the formation of an illicit finance taskforce with the aim of making the UK the most difficult place to launder money.Labour is proud of our internationalism. We are proud of our role in creating Nato. To continue to protect our values and our security we must be steadfast in our opposition to Russian aggression. We must stand with our Ukrainian allies and defend their right to independence. And we must get our own house in order by playing our part in ridding the West of its dependence on the loot of Russian kleptocracy.Keir Starmer is Leader of the Labour PartyMore from NewsTwo men took corpse into a post office to claim deceased\u0026#39s pensionArnold Schwarzenegger involved in multiple-car crashFury as low traffic neighbourhoods slowed down over 3,000 fire engines last yearYesterday, all their troubles seemed so far away: Cinema chiefs sued after Ana De Armas cut from Beatles filmThe defence of Boris Johnson the Tory establishment doesn’t want you to readMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"industrialist sir richard arkwright profited slave trade says","story":"The “Father of the Factory System” contributed to the slave trade, according to English Heritage in biographical information updated following the Black Lives Matter protests.The legacy of Sir Richard Arkwright, the British inventor credited with pioneering factory production in the 18th century, has been reassessed due to his profiting from the cotton trade during the Industrial Revolution.English Heritage has included claims that the mill owner benefited from a system which “exploited enslaved workers from Africa”, in updated online information for his blue plaque.The update, made as part of a review of blue plaques launched in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, has drawn criticism from historians concerned that history is being viewed only through the lens of the slave trade, and that ordinary workers could also be found guilty by association with a cotton industry that was supported by slavery.New online information stated: “Arkwright’s wealth from the cotton industry was inextricably linked to the transatlantic slave trade which reached its peak in the 18th century. The system exploited enslaved workers from Africa to work under horrifying conditions in the cotton plantations in the Americas.The information has been added to an online entry on Sir Richard’s blue plaque, of which the physical version is installed at 8 Adam Street, central London, where he lived in his final years before his death in 1792.In the 1770s, Sir Richard developed a “carding” machine which sped up the process prior to spinning, along with spinning frames speeding up the process of turning cotton fibre into workable yarn.He used these machines in a string of mills, including a major complex in Cromford, Derbyshire, where his creation of a disciplined working day of 13-hour shifts, involving mechanised manufacturing, led to him being nicknamed the “Father of the Factory System”.However, the factory system was criticised at the time, especially for making use of child labour, which made up a large proportion of Sir Richard’s workforce, and for subjecting workers to dangerous and inhumane conditions.Concerns have been raised that English Heritage’s update on Sir Richard, which ties him to the slave trade, could also attach to guilt to factory workers who indirectly benefited from the cotton trade by working in his mills.Prof Robert Tombs, a historian at the University of Cambridge, said: “Richard Arkwright, a working-class man who invented a machine for spinning cotton, is apparently being blamed for slavery, because most cotton was grown by slaves. So presumably workers in cotton mills, their dependents, and all their customers are also responsible.“By this logic, everybody was to blame – which is perhaps the best conclusion, as slavery and other forms of coerced labour were part of the world economy for millennia, and created much of what we now consider ‘world heritage’.”Prof Neil Biggar, a theology expert at the University of Oxford, has criticised the viewing of Sir Richard’s legacy purely through the lens of slavery, calling it a “politically biased, monomaniacal focus”.Dr Zareer Masani, a historian on British colonialism, said: “Reducing all history to that of slavery and then tracing links to it, however tenuous, of most people of influence, especially in the 18th century, has become a popular pastime with our new arbiters of taste since Black Lives Matter.”He added that this analysis misses the “ills of factory labour far closer to home”.English Heritage has been contacted for comment.More from NewsTwo men took corpse into a post office to claim deceased\u0026#39s pensionArnold Schwarzenegger involved in multiple-car crashFury as low traffic neighbourhoods slowed down over 3,000 fire engines last yearYesterday, all their troubles seemed so far away: Cinema chiefs sued after Ana De Armas cut from Beatles filmThe defence of Boris Johnson the Tory establishment doesn’t want you to readMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside number 10 defectors club","story":"There are two words to describe what it feels like to cross the floor of the House of Commons according to defector Shaun Woodward: “Relief – and that it’s ghastly.”A little over two decades before Bury South MP Christian Wakeford jumped ship from the Conservative Party to Labour last week, Mr Woodward made the same journey, a process he found both more painful than he could have imagined and, in hindsight, always inevitable. Woodward quit after the Tory leadership under William (now Lord) Hague opposed plans to repeal Section 28, the rule prohibiting the “promotion” of homosexuality in public arenas including schools. Wakeford, a 37-year-old former insurance broker, who was elected as Conservative MP for Derby South in 2019, made his dramatic departure declaring Boris Johnson and his party incapable of providing leadership in the wake of the furore over parties at No 10.Whatever the motivation, nearly all those in the small defectors’ club of MPs say they have no regrets about breaking the ultimate political taboo.Westminster might love the drama of an MP crossing the floor, but what is the human impact on the “traitors” who abandon their tribe – and on the morale of those left behind? Can they ever find a home among politicians and activists who once saw them as the enemy, or are they always viewed with suspicion? Wakeford himself has said the decision to abandon Johnson’s party for that of Sir Keir Starmer was the most difficult of his life. Clearly shaken by the experience, he admitted to sleepless nights and stumbled over his new leader’s name in his first public event as a Labour MP, momentarily giving the impression he was now serving “Keir Llama”. For Woodward too, the decision was a traumatic one – “seismic,” he says - with his departure accelerated, as, allegedly, with Wakeford, by the Whips’ Office attempting to blackmail him into toeing the line.  “I just thought – this is horrible this is not why I came into politics. So I reached out to friends in the Labour Party and said: ‘I don’t think I am going to stay in the Conservative Party.’”“I am very conscious of the people I hurt. But I didn’t go because I would be well received, I went because I couldn’t possibly stay.”Baroness Nicholson, who as Emma Nicholson crossed the floor from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats in 1995, agrees: “I suddenly flipped,” she told Radio 4’s Today programme this week. “I was getting sick and tired of John Major’s vacillation on the European issue. I could suddenly take it no longer.“The worst thing about changing political parties is that you hurt people, and you hurt people who you love dearly, admire, respected, even fought with, but you hurt them very much indeed, and to live with that hurt is really, really difficult.”Like Woodward, who was dismayed by what he saw as the abandonment by Hague of One Nation Toryism, former Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger considers that her party left her, rather than the other way round. In 2019 she co-founded The Independent Group in response to what she viewed as a failure to act against anti-Semitism under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership this later became a new political party, Change UK, before Berger eventually joined the Liberal Democrats.“It was horrific to leave my political home of 20 years,” she reflects, “but in my mind it didn’t in any way represent the values that led me to it in the first place, so I could no longer be a part of it.“I absolutely made the right decision and I don’t have any regrets and I would do it again.” Jumping ship used to be a far more common affair – Winston Churchill decamped from the Conservatives to the Liberal Party in 1904, not returning to the fold for two decades. But even then “ratting” was a high stakes game. When a group of Labour MPs resigned the whip to join Oswald Mosley’s fascist New Party in 1931, two quit after a day to become independents.In recent years, defecting has proven something of a kamikaze mission of the 23 MPs who crossed the floor in the last 30 years, all but four lost their seats at the next election, Berger among them. Of the four who survived, two – including Woodward – had been offered safer seats than those they had won under a different party’s banner.The only two to have triumphed again at the ballot box are Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, who quit the Conservatives for the UK Independent Party in 2014 crucially, both took the decision to resign as MPs and stand again in a by-election (Reckless, however, lost at the next general election).Carswell says the decision to fight a by-election was partly tactical, to put maximum pressure on then-prime minister David Cameron to hold a referendum on the question of Britain’s membership of the European Union, but also a matter of principle. Carswell’s defection was greeted relatively positively by both the voters and his party activists in his constituency of Clacton, with many in his local association following him to Ukip. To his surprise, most of his former Conservative colleagues in Parliament also remained on friendly terms.“I think they had respect for the fact that I had submitted myself to a by-election,” he says. “Had I not done that, they would have seen it as a case of getting elected under their colours then abandoning them.”That’s not to say that Carswell didn’t find the process emotional.“Anyone who is leaving one party for another is going to find difficulties. The only way to neutralise that is to resign and call a by-election.”Woodward, however, disagrees. “If you think that every time somebody crosses the floor there should be a by-election then Parliament should change the law. It shouldn’t be a reaction to one inidual’s actions. At the moment we still put the name of the candidate on the ballot paper – not the party.”Saying that, Woodward admits he felt far more comfortable in the Labour Party once he fought a general election in his new seat of St Helens. This, he says, helped him to get away from the disapproval of his former activists in his former constituency of true blue Whitney.Of Wakeford he says: “Actually, I think if he stood for a by-election, he’d probably win.” Additional reporting by Eleanor Steafel Rosa Prince is editor of The House magazineMore from NewsTwo men took corpse into a post office to claim deceased\u0026#39s pensionArnold Schwarzenegger involved in multiple-car crashFury as low traffic neighbourhoods slowed down over 3,000 fire engines last yearYesterday, all their troubles seemed so far away: Cinema chiefs sued after Ana De Armas cut from Beatles filmThe defence of Boris Johnson the Tory establishment doesn’t want you to readMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oxbridge dons say student interviews may now permanently conducted","story":"The cryptic questions asked by tutors during Oxbridge interviews have long been surrounded by an air of mystery.There is, of course, the legendary tale of a tutor throwing a rugby ball as students walk into the interview: if they caught it they got a place and if they threw it back they got a scholarship.But this may all become a thing of the past as dons says interviews could now be permanently conducted over Zoom.Typically, candidates are invited to stay overnight at the Oxbridge college they applied to while they are interviewed by different tutors.But for the second year in a row, interviews at Oxford and Cambridge –which are normally held during December - have taken place virtually.Both universities said they decided earlier this year that they would hold interviews online owing to the ongoing uncertainty” of the pandemic.They stressed that the virtual interview format in 2020 ran smoothly and that feedback was positive, with Cambridge noting that many students appeared more relaxed than when they were seen in person.Some academics now believe interviews could remain online permanently.“It begs an interesting question about whether we will ever go back to in-person interviews,” one Oxford don said.“It seems to work pretty well and we have always done it for international students. It certainly saves a lot of money feeding candidates and the colleges get an extra week of conference trade, which keeps the bursars happy.”The academic source, who is familiar with admissions, said that some dons think the switch to virtual interviews has “worked out very well”.“Some subjects are saying this is great and it is certainly more efficient. The 17-year-olds are from a generation that is so used to Zoom, it may be that this is the way of the future,” he said.“It may be better for them than being dragged to Oxford and wondering if they need to wear a suit or not. For some it\u0027s a very stressful experience to hang around and wait for an interview.”Both universities insisted that no applicants were disadvantaged by the decision to move online, with students told they could choose where to be interviewed.For example, it could be at home, at school or at a parent’s place of work and anyone from a low-income household without access to the right device was sent a tablet from their prospective college.In 2020, Cambridge University told virtual interviewees who could not afford a tablet to balance a phone on two tin cans.The university said that if a student is required to show their working out and does not have access to a laptop or tablet with a “shared screen” option, they could simply balance a phone on one or two tin cans in order to film their work.The phone could alternatively be placed on a stack of books, pointed downwards to film a student as they work out maths or science questions by pen and paper.A spokesman for Cambridge University said: “Virtual interviews, in the main, ran smoothly last year and interviewers reported that many applicants seemed to be more relaxed than when seen in person.”A spokesman for Oxford University said they decided earlier this year that it would be in  “everyone’s interests” to hold interviews online again in 2021.“Overall, the feedback from last year’s process was that the remote format worked well and we are confident that the same will be the case this year,” they said.Both universities say no decision has been made on whether interviews will be online next year, but that the decision will take into account the “lessons learned” from the past two years.More from NewsTwo men took corpse into a post office to claim deceased\u0026#39s pensionArnold Schwarzenegger involved in multiple-car crashFury as low traffic neighbourhoods slowed down over 3,000 fire engines last yearYesterday, all their troubles seemed so far away: Cinema chiefs sued after Ana De Armas cut from Beatles filmThe defence of Boris Johnson the Tory establishment doesn’t want you to readMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"perhaps meghan just doesnt want visit uk","story":"There is much discussion in royal circles about whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are going to return for the Platinum Jubilee celebrations and – crucially – whether they will be booed by the public.I, for one, would rather not see Harry and Meghan treated so shoddily, not least if they are within earshot of Her Majesty the Queen as she marks this truly historic milestone.But fears of a hostile reception from ardent monarchists may go some way to explaining the current row over royal protection.Prince Harry is seeking a judicial review of Home Secretary Priti Patel’s decision to strip him of his UK police protection team, claiming it is too dangerous for him and his wife to visit Britain without Scotland Yard bodyguards.Lawyers acting for the prince, 37, who stepped down from royal duties two years ago, have written a “pre-action protocol” letter to the Home Office, threatening to go to the High Court if his family are not provided with security while they are in this country, which they have offered to pay for.Yet as many royal commentators, and indeed former royal bodyguards have pointed out, the couple will automatically be enveloped into the Met’s policing of the Jubilee because it’s an official event. It was the same when Harry came over for Prince Philip’s funeral.What this seems to be about is the policing of the couple’s private visits to the UK – but surely by their very nature, they pose no significant security risk?Celia Walden wrote a shrewd piece in these pages on Tuesday, in which she suggested that “bored Harry is trying to tell us he wants to come home”.But maybe what the Sussexes are really trying to tell us is that Meghan categorically doesn’t.

But, for his scientific accomplishments, his conviction that all men and women should be judged on their merits, civic-mindedness, and the reforming zeal he brought to British science and education, we remain in his debt. For these reasons we think his name should stay on Imperial’s walls.”Prof Armand Leroi, an expert in evolutionary developmental biology at Imperial College, said the recommendations produced by the history group are “frankly shocking”.“Many members of staff were quite outraged, especially the biologists,” he said. “Huxley was such a champion of egalitarianism, of access to science, of working class education. These are all things he worked for tirelessly in his life.“By the standards of the day he was an extraordinarily enlightened man - he fought against the racist scientists of his day who were allied with slavery ideologues in the US. He should be seen in the context and the mood of his time.”Prof Leroi said that it is “perfectly right” for an institution to examine its own history but added that removing Huxley’s name and bust is a “knee jerk reaction”.A spokesman for Imperial College said that its governing body - known as the president’s board - will have an update next month about its proposed course of action.More from NewsTwo men took corpse into a post office to claim deceased\u0026#39s pensionArnold Schwarzenegger involved in multiple-car crashFury as low traffic neighbourhoods slowed down over 3,000 fire engines last yearYesterday, all their troubles seemed so far away: Cinema chiefs sued after Ana De Armas cut from Beatles filmThe defence of Boris Johnson the Tory establishment doesn’t want you to readMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"downing street party before philip","story":"Downing Street party before Philip funeral ran to am with guests using Wilfs slideBoris Johnson apologised to the Queen this week over the events, which he said he deeply and bitterly regrettedthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video boris-johnson-looks-down-during-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:ZJOMpek,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The night before, officials danced while drinking wine in plastic cups, ordered takeaway pizza and tried out Boris Johnsonaposs son Wilfaposs slide, according to The .Government guidance at the time warned: “You must not socialise indoors except with your household or support bubble. “You can meet outdoors, including in gardens, in groups of six people or two households.  Boris Johnson has apologised to the Queen for the events, which he said he deeply and bitterly regretted.The Prime Minister was not at either event as he was at his Chequers country retreat, No  said when the events were first reported last week. The latest details come as the PM was battling to save his premiership, with plans to spend the weekend at Chequers trying to win over his mutinous MPs. Officials allegedly took part in a seven-hour drinking session at two separate dos to say farewell to Boris Johnsonaposs top spin doctor and a Downing Street photographer. Theclaims to have obtained a picture of staff in the Downing Street basement, where people were drinking wine and spirits out of plastic cups.  Text messages also indicate that attendees were still partying at am, having started at around pm. The existence of photos and texts could provide further fuel for Sue Grayaposs partygate inquiry, which is expected to be published next week. One of the events was for James Slack, the PMaposs departing director of communications, which was held in the press area and then the garden. He has apologised for the bash. He said in a statement: “This event should not have happened at the time that it did. I am deeply sorry, and take full responsibility.”  The second event for a photographer, which was held in the basement, where an adviser alleged acted as a DJ using a laptop. Wine was reportedly spilled on a printer where the laptop was blaring music out. The events reportedly merged when they eventually moved to the garden, where it is alleged that some attendees went down a childaposs slide belonging to the PMaposs son Wilf. It was previously claimed that Wilfaposs swing had been broken by guests. Mr Johnson appeared visibly distressed when he told reporters that he had apologised to the Queen over the parties. I deeply and bitterly regret that that happened, he told reporters this week. I can only renew my apologies both to Her Majesty and to the country for misjudgments that were made, and for which I take full responsibility.aposapos The revelations about the parties last week sparked a major backlash, compounding the Prime Ministeraposs woes as he battles for his own survival. The claim that an aide was dispatched to the Co-op supermarket on The Strand to fill a suitcase with wine was widely mocked. Last week, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: “It is deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning. No  has apologised to the Palace.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authoritywas set up to publish details of costs claimed back by MPs under transparency rules drawn up in response to public fury over the expenses scandal. The body “paused” publication of inidual claims in November , following the murder of Sir David Amess at a surgery in his constituency. They have not set a date for the review to be completed. Tom Brake, director of campaign group Unlock Democracy, said: “Ipsa have a responsibility to ensure that no information they release endangers MPs. “But equally they have a duty to make public information about MPs expenses and to confirm when they will do this. He added: “A prolonged delay is harmful to the transparency and accountability of elected representatives and damaging to democracy.”IPSA chiefs said in November the body would review what information was made public, and resume publications in the new year. On Thursday IPSA published ‘top line’ totals for MPs spending in - - but told the Sunday Mirror the publication of inidual claims is still “under review.” Full expenses claims are supposed to be published every two months - but the most recent publication dates back to last April .

On Tuesday, January , over a dozen Tory MPs are thought to have met to conspire over Boris Johnson ’s future in a gathering dubbed as the ‘ pork pie plot.’ While some MPs have publicly urged Johnson to quit over the Downing Street parties held during the  lockdown, several MPs have reportedly already submitted their no confidence letters to the  Committee chaired by Sir Graham Brady.Here’s what you need to know about a no confidence vote and what will happen next. How is a vote of no confidence triggered   A vote of no confidence would be triggered% of Tory MPs write to Sir Brady saying they no longer have confidence in Boris Johnson.There were  Tory MPs - prior to Christian Wakefordaposs defection to Labour - this means that  would need to submit letters to trigger the no confidence vote.How many letters have been submitted is a closely guarded secret kept by Sir Graham, but MPs are free to publicly confirmthey have submitted theirs. For instance, veteran backbencher Sir Roger Gale and Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross both confirmed that they had submitted their letters. If the  letters are sent to the  Committee, then a vote is held with a secret ballot of Tory MPs taking place. The MPs will vote in support of or against their leader, andover % of them vote against Johnson, he will be ousted. What would happenBoris Johnson is ousted from his position  If majority votes against Johnson, a leadership contest to choose the countryaposs next leader would get underway immediately in the Conservative Party.Any leader who loses a confidence vote is not allowed to take part in the next leadership contest, so Johnson would not be able to compete. However,he wins the vote of no confidence, his position is secured for a further  months, although  backbenchers are murmuring about changing the rules to bring this down to six months.A general election will only take placehalf of MPs voted against the Government in a separate no confidence motion. Potential candidates for the next prime minister include Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab, Health Secretary Sajid Javid, Home Secretary Priti Patel as well as Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt.What is the  Committee  The  Committee - formally known as the Conservative Private Members’ Committee - is a group of Tory backbenchers who meet weekly when the Commons is sitting to discuss party matters. Currently chaired by Sir Graham Brady, the MP for Altrincham and Sale West, the purpose of it is to give less senior members of the party an opportunity to discuss any issues. The committee will then have a monthly meeting with the party leader to share the opinions within the party.

The same cannot be said of the Prime Minister. While the number of Omicron cases is falling in London it is still re in other parts of England. Boris Johnson chose to ignore this when he announced a blanket lting of Plan B restrictions this week.The sensible course would have been to maintain our guard until the threat posed by Omicron had subsided in every region. The Prime Minister is not being driven by the data – despite his repeated claims – but by politically expediency. Many believe he rushed into it because his job is on the line and he needs to curry favour with his backbenchers. It is entirely in keeping with Johnson’s behaviour that he has put his own interests ahead of those of the country. By continuing to wear masks the public are showing better judgment than those making the rules. Game to act There are few more sickening trades than trophy hunting. Killing endangered animals is not a sport but a heartless act of barbarity. So it is depressing to read that big game hunting is still big business in the US. The annual Safari Club International Convention in Las Vegas offers bloodthirsty Americans the chance to spend tens of thousands of dollars to slaughter wild animals. The UK government has pledged action on trophy hunting but has so far failed to bring in the necessary legislation. There is no reason for this delay.

He adds that when Tory politicians need to woo the populist vote they threaten to make the BBC pay for itselfCan you imagine this lot filling our BBC TV schedules opinionByBrian Reade:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan As far as the right is concerned the BBC has always been the Great Distractor. When foreign-based newspaper barons want to rail against the evils of liberal elites they home in on the leftie BBC. When Tory politicians need to woo the populist vote they threaten to make the Bloated Beeb pay for itself.The last time Boris Johnson played this hand was during the  General Election when he was attacked for refusing, while on-screen, to look at a Daily Mirror front page showing a sick four-year-old on an AE floor. Within hours he was threatening to scrap the TV licence.And now, as he sups in the Last Chance Saloon, he’s sent out his pom-pom swinging fangirl Nadine Dorries to tell BBC bosses she has their testicles in a vice. That’s the laughably titled culture secretary who believes taxpayers fund Channel  and probably thinks Lord Reith is something a peer lays at the Cenotaph.  Tories like to pretend they are in favour of public service broadcasting, so long as it can be bent to their will. But what would it look likethey ran the stripped-down BBC today. Here, I’m guessing, would be the highlights: the day opens with a recording of Vera Lynn singing God Save The Queen and is followed by Wake-Up Don’t Woke-Up presented by Esther McVey in the Downing Street TV studio with Julia Hartley-Brewer reviewing all papers except the Mirror and . CBeebies’ flagship show is Watch With Nanny in which Jacob Rees-Mogg’s nanny plays the penny whistle as his children, dressed in naval unorm, recite important dates from the Napoleonic Wars. Antiques Roadshow is revamped, with Bernard Ingham catching up with the latest views from local Conservative associations. As is Upstairs, Downstairs in which Rishi Sunak tells us what it’s like to live in a stately home during an energy crisis and how to cut off the heating in the servants’ quarters. On The Travel Show, Mark Francois lists things to do when stuck in three-hour passport queues in Europe due to Brexit, and Dominic Raab gives tips on how to ignore your mobile while relaxing on a Corfu sunbed as Kabul falls. In Flog It! think-tanks update us on ways to privatise the NHS and EastEnders becomes WestEnders, a story of First World problems in Fulham and Cha. On Jobsearch, Nadine Dorries herself explains how you can get your daughters on the public payroll and Matt Hancock shows how to give multi-million pound contracts to the bloke down the pub. Grandstand s with polo, croquet and fox-hunting with a shower of Berkeley Hunts, and foodies are served Truss’s Kitchen Nightmares, where the foreign secretary advises on how to cope when you run out of British cheese. There’s Dragons’ Den Does Dover in which Priti Patel hears contestants pitch new ways to repel migrants and Hospital will show the NHS in a fresh light, with no AE queues and staff delighted with their workload. Comedy-wise there’s Mock The Weak in which Jim Davidson and Roy Chubby Brown openly humiliate minorities, and Would I Lie To You  sees Boris Johnson do a weekly press conference. And each day closes at midnight with Land of Dope and Tory played from a model of the new royal yacht. Unless you’ve put your foot through your telly hours before and gone to bed, that is.

Tories are acting like kindergarten childrenChristina Horner, , said shewill stick with voting for Keir Starmer at the next General Election.Ms Horner, from Stockport, said: I think the Tories are acting like kindergarten children. The Conservatives are hardly professional politicians.  I wish theyaposd focus on working people and poorer families.The Conservative Party always pretends to care, but itaposs clear they have no interests in anything apart from making their own pockets bigger.We saw it in the pandemic. Somehow the rich got richer. How does that level up the country  I want to know whataposs happening with the economy - not partiesGordon White, , retired from Radclfe, said:Iaposm sick and tired of hearing about these parties.I want to know whataposs happening with the economy. He had a party, so what! Is that going to solve the cost of living crisis  No. He got us through Covid, heaposs given us Brexit.I want to hear more about the good things he has in store for this country, not some unfounded allegations. Let politicians govern. Boris Johnson is toying with the country Marc Eulett, an accountant from Radclfe, said: Iaposve voted for the Conservatives and Labour in my letime. The -year-old said: Iaposve always been a swing voter but the latest party allegations have really done it for me. Boris Johnson is toying with the country. I canapost say Iaposm shocked but I feel embarrassed for us all, working people of this country. I wonapost say who Iaposve voted for but the next election will be tough. Sadly I do believe heaposll be able to walk away from these accusations as he does with most things. I still canapost believe a word he says Audrey Jolly, , from Radclfe is still unsureshe will vote Labour at the next election, having swung her normal Labour vote to back Mr Johnson at the  election. But Alison Jolly, , believes the Conservatives are unable to take care of the country. I thought Boris handled Covid really well but then the party allegations came out. I mean heaposs had such a rough start. Heaposs had Covid and heaposs got two little children. Itaposs been hard for him and heaposs doing the best he can.The fact that Dominic Cummings is coming out of the woodwork to try and accuse the PM of doing things, just says it all to be honest. But I still canapost believe a word he says because heaposs not being straightforward. To be honest my dad will be turning in his gravehe knew I voted Conservatives, and Boris has let me down. Alison said the Conservatives are behaving in a pathetic manner. Swanning off and having parties while the Queen was forced to bury her husband alone  What about the people who have lost loved ones to Covid  Itaposs not right at all and Iaposve had enough. I am so sick and tired of this Government. The fact that Mr Wakeford had to leave the party he was elected in says it all.

Marc Spaganuolo has spent the last  years struggling to control his bowels and his bladder - but stayed quiet about his condition because he was embarrassed. But now heaposs started making TikTok videos to let other people with incontinence know theyaposre not alone. Marc, , suffers from a degenerative nerve condition called peripheral neuropathy, meaning his brain doesnapost receive signals when the bladder and bowel are full. First suffering from incontinence when he was , he went through years of tests before finally getting his diagnosis when he was  years old.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Currently looking for love, Marc is even open and honest about his condition on his dating profile - claiming most people are open and understanding about it.  He said: It started with bed wetting. I tried to hide it and blamed it on my dog at first. My dog was elderly so I got away with that for a few months. Eventually, my dad found out and said aposWe need to take you to the doctorapos. I didnapost want to go, but my dad was saying it could be a urinary tract infection. That convinced me. It was embarrassment that stopped me wanting to go. It wasnapost like it was happening every night, it was sporadic at first. Here and there. Now itaposs daily. At first, Marc was told heaposd grow out of the condition, but as time went on, it became clear that wasnapost the case.  After a while of living with the condition, he discovered protective underwear, which he now wears daily. I believe in being upfront about it. I feel like those terminologies created a ide in my mind and kept me from dealing with it. Itaposs a diaper, letaposs own it, he said. To go through this as a teenager was an isolating experience. Over time, I would tell a person here and person there, my courage would grow. It was a decade long process of telling people here and there. It was hard to define a specic point where I got confident, but I want people to feel confident in talking about it. For Marc, the ultimate show of confidence was when he set up the TikTok account. Using the alias aposThe Diaper Dynamoapos, Marc explains how incontinence affects his day-to-day le and how he deals with aposself-diaperingapos.  Now, one of Marcaposs challenges is the world of dating - but his condition throws up problems. He said: One of the biggest challenges of my le is dating, because itaposs been such a gradual process for me to get to where I am now. But of course, Iaposd love to meet somebody. But through his TikTok, heaposs hoping to tap into a community and provide support to those who need it. He said: I started my TikTok in September . I knew people needed help with this stuff, and it took off from there. TikTokaposs algorithm was really good at finding people who needed this content. Marc now has , followers on the , with most people offering him support about his condition. Itaposs been a pretty wild ride, itaposs been eye opening in a few dferent ways, he said. But putting myself out there on TikTok and seeing the overwhelming amount of love and support made me realise I need to put myself out there and give people a chance to respond.  Itaposs been so many years that Iaposve been living with this and Iaposve gotten so used to talking about it in my everyday le that I knew showing this would be a big deal to helping people. This is a really common issue and thereaposs a reason why these products are made. Explaining incontinence affects between  and  million people around the world, he said parents have thanked him for his honesty, saying itaposs helped their children. I feel incredibly honoured when parents say my videos helped their kid. It sometimes brings a tear to my eye, he said. It wasnapost where I was intending to go with the content, but the fact that it has an impact on them is great. One woman said she showed it to her six-year-old and she responded aposIaposm not a freakapos. Thataposs the point. Evenyou have to live this way for the rest of your le, you can still find happiness and be who you want to be. Due to the unpredictable nature of his condition, Marc makes sure heaposs always prepared and keeps spare nappies and wipes to hand to clear up any accidents. He said: I keep diapers in a backpack, along with wipes. It depends where Iaposm going and what Iaposm doing, of course. I prefer and recommend diapers because Iaposve heard so many horror stories about catheters and stomas. I just think aposwhy go through that when I can manage with a diaper apos If Iaposm at a social event, I tend to be more discreet about it. I still get self-conscious from time to time. When I used to work in an office, Iaposd change midday in a private restroom.Do you have a real le story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcWhile not everyone is kind about Marcaposs condition, many viewers of his videos are supportive.

Is a change to your sense of taste a sign of Omicron  Here’s what you need to knowOmicron symptoms are more similar to a common cold Image: Getty ImagesByMalvika PadinTrends Writer:,  Jan | comments Since it began spreading in late November last year, the Omicron Covid iant has proven to be quite dferent than the previous strains of coronavirus.With symptoms that have been described as being more similar to a common cold, Omicron usually presents as a mild infection. However, the symptoms have been found very dferent from the classic three signs of Covid that we are used to.According to the NHS, the most common signs of coronavirus are a fever, new and continuous cough as well as a loss or change to sense of taste or smell.But is a change to your sense of taste a symptom of Omicron  Hereaposs everything you need to know Is altered taste a symptom of Omicron   A loss or change to your sense of taste or smell means that people who have coronavirus tend not be able to smell or taste anything properly, or things will smell or taste slightly dferent to normal. However, Omicron symptoms have been found to be dferent, with members of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , saying: There is some preliminary evidence emerging of changes in reported symptoms with Omicron infection. In particular, loss of taste or smell seem to be reported less frequently.  Professor Tim Spector of King’s College London, who is leading ZOE symptom appaposs Covid study, also warned that many people may not realise they have Covid. This is because Omicron symptoms are more similar to a common cold and donapost present with a cough, fever, or loss of taste or smell. Though symptoms of the virus have continued to change, there hasnapost been any updates made to the governmentaposs official symptoms list since last spring. How to tellyour sense of taste or smell has changed  An estimated , UK adults have been affected by a change or loss of sense of taste smell, according to Fth Sense, a charity for people affected by smell and taste disorders. The symptom means that food gives off an unpleasant odour or taste, such as rotten meat or chemicals. The specic cause for sensory loss is unknown, but a study published in the Nature Genetics journal suggests that genetics could be play an important role in a person experiencing loss or change in taste or smell after Covid infection. While smell training which involves snfing at least four distinctive smells to retrain the brain is one way to regain sensory loss, most people who experience smell and taste loss because of virus usually regain their sense spontaneously. What are the main symptoms of Omicron   The most common symptoms of Omicron, according to the ZOE Covid study are:Scratchy throat Runny NoseFatigue Body aches and pains SneezingOther reported signs of the iant include headaches, congestion, nausea and vomiting, skin rashes, night sweats, brain fog.

Hannah Grinsted, who is due to get married in August, was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly after her st birthday.She claims she was repeatedly sent away by her GP over a period of five months in the belief that a lump in her armpit was being caused by something other than cancer.Following treatment, she began reliving her new le with the hope she had beaten cancer but tragically two years ago it ed, DevonLive reports.She has now been told her cancer is incurable, but treatments are available to prolong her le as much as possible with hope always around the corner of new trials. Hannah is now urging people to trust their gut instinctthey think something is seriously wrong with them and to not take no for an answer. Hannah, who previously worked for Avis Car Hire, recalled: I went to the doctors five to six times and I kept getting told it was a blocked gland or something to do with the deodorant I used, or it was related to my age and puberty.  I was not necessarily feeling poorly but I felt a lot of pain and I always thought that pain didnapost mean cancer but that isnapost the case. I was also suffering from pain down my back and front. Eventually I was referred to the RDE and a scan showed I had three tumours in my breast, and eight out my  lymph nodes had cancer in them so it was quite a lot. My first thought was that I was going to die. My mum was with me and she had an expression on her face I had never seen before. She was obviously very supportive and has been throughout my cancer journey. My whole world turned upside down in that moment and I went into a panic attack. Before Hannah began chemotherapy and radiotherapy in , due to her young age she was offered fertility treatment to preserve some of her eggs in case the treatment prevented her from being able to have children. Unfortunately, due to the severity of her cancer, Hannah was only able to have fertility treatment over a -day period which meant only four of her eggs have been able to be stored which greatly reduced her chances of becoming a mum. She also underwent a mastectomy and reconstruction surgery and had her lymph nodes removed. Hannah was later told she was in remission but says she never received a final scan to confirm the diagnosis.It was assumed I was cancer-free so I put on Facebook the good news, she said. I had not told anyone before then that I had cancer.However, around six months later while on a girly holiday in Ibiza, Hannah began experiencing severe problems with one of her legs. Suddenly she was unable to walk or put weight on it and kept falling over. On her , she went to her GP and said she had feared the cancer had ed, but says she was reassured it hadnapost and was sent home. After her leg showed no signs of improvement she was eventually referred back to hospital. On Christmas Eve , her worst fears were confirmed when she received a telephone call saying the cancer was back and this time it was in her femur. Hannah recalled: I was sat on my own at work on the late sht when I got the telephone call. When cancer gets into your bone itaposs incurable. I had a metal pole fitted into the centre of my femur because my bones are very brittle now. I also had one batch of radiotherapy and was on oral chemotherapy for about  months. The cancer held in my bone for about  months which was quite good, but about three months ago it was confirmed it had moved to my liver. Now itaposs also moved to my lungs, unfortunately, and the bottom of my pelvis.  It means that Hannah has started a course of intravenous chemotherapy treatment once a week for  weeks. This week she received her fth bout and has lost her hair again. In a bid to boost her spirits ahead of her upcoming wedding day in August, Hannahaposs cousin Sammi Williams has launched an online fundraiser called Help Hannah Fight Cancer. So far it has already raised more than £, of its target of £,. The fundraiser is being used to help make Hannahaposs big day the best it can be for her and her partner of nearly three years Charlie Cox,  - and it is also funding a luxurious handmade wig to help Hannah feel more confident.

I was part of the Re:Act Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. The NHS was under the cosh at the time and I was part of the RE:ACT Disaster Response team who stepped up to help. I helped build the Nightingale hospitals in Wales and also worked with the local council in Hereford to distribute PPE. Now I’m at the pop-up vaccination centre in Hereford. There are two of us here who are ex-military – the other guy is an ex-submariner so we’ve got a broad range of skills. There’s not a lot that comes across our path that bamboozles us.The first time I volunteered was on a day off from work. We were tasked with letting people know about the vaccination centre, but of course we didn’t want to browbeat them so we let people come to us. Initially people thought we were giving out lateral flow tests – we’d say, No, we’re here for boosters or your first or second vaccination. It was quiet for the first hour, but word obviously spread around Hereford and by the end of the day I’d say we’d vaccinated about  people, from schoolkids upwards. I think . per cent of people were happy to have a vaccination. I thought: Evenyou get five people vaccinated, that’s five people who won’t suffer.” Yes, you might catch it, but you’re much less likely to end up in hospital. When people ask meI think it works, I feel like I can provide the back story for them.We’ve now even had people come in for their first jabs. I asked one, What changed your mind  He said,Omicron, because it’s more infectious’. I just said, “Well done.”So while I don’t strong-arm people, I do tell them, “I think you should get vaccinated. ‘We all need the booster so that le can get back to normal’  I joined the Royal Air Force in  and my last posting was out in Cyprus, but I always wanted to transition to a career in the NHS. Back in October  I joined the East of England Covid- mass vaccination programme and my first role was to provide support in the planning and delivery of large-scale centres, hospital hubs and community pharmacies. Now I’m working as the children’s project manager, leading and coordinating plans. This involves collating, analysing and improving plans, reporting to the programme director and the national team, using my past experiences to collaborate, advise and implement processes.  I’m good at seeing a problem and thinking outside the box to solve it. I can get parachuted into a project within the Covid- programme and am able to run with it. Every day is dferent, but that doesn’t faze me. I’m very adaptable and flexible – and I’ll give  per cent to achieving the common goal. Working with other people from the Forces means there’s a great sense of camaraderie. We share the same service ethos. If there’s a deadline, we’ll just knuckle down and get the job done. This is not a - job. Even though I might have to get up at .am to jump on a work call, I have no problem with that. I was motivated to join the Covid- programme by my sense of duty, and I’m really proud to be part of it. I have a passion for helping people and making sure things are completed to the highest standard. This gives me a real sense of achievement. I like being able to make a dference. The public response to getting boosted has been great, but there is still a long way to go. I believe the Get Boosted Now campaign is so important because we need to protect ourselves, the vulnerable and the future generations. We also need to get everyone boosted so we can get le back to normal as soon as possible. ‘One of my ex-soldiers gave me the Covid- jab’  I was  when I joined the Navy as a medic. It was the year after the Falklands War and I thought I’d like to get involved in something for the service of the country – to do what’s necessary when the time comes. As a Navy medic I was trained to deal with trauma from the very basic things up to the most drastic ones you could think of, like gunshots and traumatic amputations. After  years, I left in  to join the Army, then in  I moved to the NHS. During the pandemic I was initially asked to oversee the distribution of PPE. There were shortages across the board, and having worked overseas with the Royal Marines, my logistics knowledge came to the fore. I could make sure community midwives and health visitors had what they needed. In some cases this entailed doing the deliveries myself in the van!  For me, the pleasure in the role was being able to provide medical staff with the assurance that they would have the equipment they needed. I felt I was making a real dference. When the time came to get my Covid- jab, it was one of my former soldiers who gave me it. That was very impressive because when I met him he was , wide-eyed and fresh out of the box. When I next met him he was teaching the volunteers and St John’s Ambulance staff how to administer the vaccine. I was full of admiration for him. He’d stepped up as a young man and was teaching much more mature iniduals. But I wasn’t surprised – that’s what we expected our troops to do: step into the breach, wherever the breach happens to be. You can’t praise the veterans highly enough for getting involved in the vaccine campaign. They will serve their community in whatever circumstances, whether it’s dficult or easy. You’ve got a group of people who drop everything as soon as they’re asked, regardless of what their family commitment might be, and go and do the job. I don’t think there is a better resource for the country to draw upon.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON British ArmyRoyal Air ForceNHSRoyal MarinesFalklands WarNigel JonesJake WadeHelen RobertsHospitalsSoldiersArmed forcesTeenagersThe FalklandsMost ReadRecommended"},{"url":null,"title":"covid cases week after christmas","story":"Covid cases week after Christmas TRIPLE official figure with k a day, new data showsThe governments coronavirus dashboard recorded an average of , new Covid cases per day between December  and January , however the Office for National Statistics says the true number of infections was likely to be nearer , a daythis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video coronavirus-numbers-uk-death-toll-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:HqrxQIEI,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Meanwhile, health agencies have urged caution about interpreting the regular case numbers published each day for the UK, following changes in rules about testing.An average of , new cases of coronavirus per day were recorded from December  to January , according to the governmentaposs Covid- dashboard.But the true number of cases was likely to be nearer , a day, according to estimates by the Office for National Statistics . The sharp dference between the two figures shows just how many infections are being missed on the dashboard site. It comes as the government prepares to lt Plan B restrictions in England next week, meaning vaccine passports for large venues will end and people will no longer need to work from home.  Face masks will also no longer be a legal requirement from January .The move comes following increasing evidence the Omicron wave has peaked following a % drop in cases in a week.However, the number of infections on the governmentaposs Covid dashboard may be far lower than the actual figure. The dashboard only counts those people who have reported themselves as having tested positive for the virus.  This means the numbers are affected by how many people are coming forward for tests, have chosen to report their test results, or who are taking a test because they know they have coronavirus symptoms. By contrast, the ONS figures are based on analysis of nose and throat swabs taken from a representative sample of more than , people in private households. The same people are sampled every week, regardless of whether they know they have Covid- or have reported a positive result. The ONS then produces estimates of the likely number of new cases of coronavirus across the country. The estimates for the week after Christmas have only now been published, due to the time needed to collect and process the data.  The number of new cases reported by the government has always been lower than the level estimated by the ONS, but the gap has become wider since the arrival of the Omicron iant of the virus.In the week to November , before Omicron had started to spread in the UK, the ONS estimated an average of , new cases a day - just over twice the average of , a day recorded on the dashboard. The ONS estimates are now nearly three times the equivalent total on the dashboard. High levels of under-reporting will still be affecting the governmentaposs daily figures, meaning the true volume of cases in the UK is increasingly unclear. The recent change in the rules for testing, removing the the need for asymptomatic people to get a confirmatory PCR test after a positive lateral flow result, is also likely to affect the daily figures.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter In its latest weekly Covid- surveillance report, the Health Security Agency said the removal of confirmatory PCR testing may affect case rates in England. Public Health Wales has estimated that removing the follow-up test is likely to reduce overall reported cases by at least %, based on analyses linking lateral flow tests to PCR positive episodes. The agency acknowledged that changes in testing behaviour may lead to under-reporting should symptomatic new cases not test using PCR. In Scotland, health officials have recently widened their method of counting new cases to also include people who have recorded a first positive lateral flow test - though this change has yet to be reflected in the figures published on the UK government dashboard. The dashboard numbers are currently limited to all positive lab-confirmed PCR test results in the UK, plus positive lateral flow tests in Northern Ireland and, in England, any positive lateral flow tests not followed by a negative PCR test taken within  hours.

The instructor says he is trying to do good by helping learners in London to beat the current waiting lists, by advertising test dates given to him by an unnamed examiner - who is now being investigated by motoring chiefs.His Facebook marketplace listings posted repeatedly over the last two weeks contain a roll of  alleged February dates at  dferent centres, charging an eye-watering £ rather than the usual £ to £.  When Steve was contacted by undercover reporters posing as learners, he bragged that heaposs been selling tests from a very handy mystery examiner for a number of months and claimed he had tests available as soon as three days away their centres being booked up for months on the official system. He even claimed learners were engaging in bidding wars over the test slots, with one test going for as much as £. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agencyconfirmed they are investigating the unnamed examiner, while it remains unclear how the unknown man is able to provide the slots to other instructors or whether he is breaching any rules or guidelines when doing so. Steve, who lives in Shepherdaposs Bush, said: Itaposs a six month waiting list so I was just trying to help some people out. Iaposm sure thereaposs people that would say itaposs fair and some people who say it isnapost.  I donapost buy the tests. Iaposm just a middle man. If you look at the DVSA and look who has bought them, my name wonapost be next to it. I go through someone . Iaposve got someone who lets me know theyaposve got these tests, then I pass them out to my students and anyone who needs them. I was just trying to help some people, and I only make £ from each booking and the rest goes to the other party. Itaposs not a huge amount of money. I thought I was doing people some favours by offering out the contact that Iaposve got. The guyaposs an examiner or an ex-examiner. I didnapost think it was dodgy, not really. Thereaposs hundreds of apps out there that you can get driving cancellations on. I just assumed it was one of those. A student got in contact with him, and then she put me in contact with him. Iaposm trying to do good. Some people will put the time in to press that refresh button and keep clicking, spending  hours a day doing it, and some people would rather pay someone  to do it. If itaposs not allowed then I will happily stop right now. I donapost want to get in trouble and I donapost want to get anyone  in trouble. I donapost want to get on the wrong side of anyone, let alone the DVSA. Driving tests cost £ to be taken on a weekday and £ for a weekend, but by paying an extra £ and providing your provisional driving licence and theory pass numbers Steve says he can help jump the queue. London resident Aleksandrs Krasuckis, whose partner Korina Anderson has had to wait from September until next month to take her test three hours away from home, has branded Steveaposs actions as selfish. Aleksandrs said: Heaposs being selfish and taking advantage of desperate learners. Who is he doing the right thing for  It must be himself because heaposs earning money from it. When the price is that high, itaposs not the right thing for everyone. I was just p***** off with this kind of person, keeping the slots for themselves. I understand itaposs quicker and thataposs a good thing but itaposs too high of a price for me. The DVSA should be looking into it, and maybe the trainees should book the test themselves and not the driving instructor. It would cut out this kind of thing. Steven claims heaposs been called aposkindapos for providing the quick-booking tests to learners and even suggests the DVSA should begin to operate it in the same way airlines provide priority boarding. However Steve deleted his initial Facebook listing after being informed of the DVSAaposs investigation into the unnamed examiner. A DVSA spokesperson said: DVSA does not stand for any abuse of our customer service booking systems and are investigating. We will not hesitate in taking actionany misconduct is identied. We will take action against any instructor guilty of misconduct at the expense of legitimate candidates who have patiently waited for their opportunity to test. Any tests booked outside of the official DVSA booking site could be a scam and may result in candidates not having a test slot.

Care worker Lorraine King, , and her kids have had to wash themselves with hot water from a kettle since their home in West London was damaged by a leak.She told MyLondon: I’ve got to either boil the kettle or even go and take a bath at my daughter’s which is miles away. It’s not convenient.Lorraine, who works in care, said her home, owned by the Catalyst Housing association, has flooded at least once a year since she moved in. She said: It’s happened in the front room three times and also the bedroom, bathroom, toilet. It’s just constant. -  She said the latest incident happened on Boxing Day, when water flooded through the ceiling of her front room where her granddaughter was playing. Lorraine lives with her son and two daughters and they are still waiting for their home to be fixed and claims sheaposs had no advice on when it will be sorted.She also said multiple maintenance workers have come to the property since but no one has fixed the issue and there seems to be poor communication across the company.  She added: The repairs take extra long to do. The guy left us with no hot water or heating. Then they contacted me two weeks later and told me they weren’t aware we didn’t have any heating. They gave us these little oil heaters, which don’t heat up the room at all. The whole house really does smell because of the flood. According to Lorraine, someone came to look at the problem weeks later and turned the electricity back on within a few hours another leak happened.  She said: The whole thing was flooded. There was no advice. I’ve still got no heating or hot water. Every contractor who comes says they don’t know anything about it and they’ve just come to assess it. Clearly they’re not communicating. Lorraine said she is worried a family member could be electrocuted because of the damp conditions and the stress of the repeated leaks is affecting her mental health. She said: It’s happened so much, I’m now having mental health issues and I never had this before I moved into the property. On Saturday, I had a total meltdown because I just couldn’t handle it any more and I’ve still got to come into work. I can’tproperly because I don’t feel myself.  Lorraine says she was on the housing waiting list for  years before she moved into her first permanent home in Kensington and Cha in . But she said the new build has had so many defects she almost cannot stand to live there any more. She said: Eventhey repair it I’m not comfortable in that property because I’ll decorate it and it’ll be ruined again. A spokesperson for Catalyst said: “We are sorry for the inconvenience and distress caused. We believe the source of the current problem is a leaking communal heating pipe in Ms King’s ceiling. To permanently fix the pipe, we need to take down the ceiling, and we are speaking with Ms King to arrange for adequate access to her home and enough time to complete the work and replace and redecorate her ceiling.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Mental healthFloodspovertyHousing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Reaseheath Agricultural College students claim they saw local builders were allowed in for a meal while wearing filthy boots. Teen farmer Jamie Goode, , from Holmes Chapel, said: “We were shocked when they wouldn’t let us in. We just laughed at them. “This lady was standing there and said that before we could enter, we had to take our boots off.  All our boots were clean and certainly not mucky but they insisted they wouldnapost let us in unless we took them off. There were a lot of workmen going in with their boots on, and theirs were filthy. Jamie believes someone from his college may have told restaurant staff to stop students entering with their boots on. He said: When we asked why [we couldnapost go in], they said Reaseheath [college] said we should be told to take our boots off. “But when we got back, the college said they knew nothing about such an instruction. They said it was probably a health and safety issue to ask to take our boots off, but this is not rightthey are allowing the building trade inside with their boots. He added: “We don’t even understand how they knew that we were from the college – we didn’t have our ID badges on or anything. A spokesperson from McDonaldaposs said: “We are proud supporters of British and Irish agriculture and work with over , farmers across the UK and Ireland. We have a strong relationship with the local Agricultural college and we have an agreement in place to ensure students that visit our restaurant remove their wellington boots, to ensure the restaurant maintains the high standards that all our customers expect. We greatly appreciate the cooperation of the college and students, and look forward to continuing to welcome them to our restaurant in the future.” The Mirror has contacted McDonaldaposs for further comment.

But the charity which is home to hundreds of rescued dogs, cats, horses, rabbits  goats could not afford the £, needed for the urgent repairs. So the sanctuary’s chairman, actress and Strictly star Gemma Atkinson, launched a fundraising appeal, backed by the Sunday People, to raise the cash.  After the donkeys and their plight featured in the People, donations began to flood in and the sanctuary has been able to give the donkeys the home they deserve so they can live out the rest of their lives in luxury. Actress Gemma told the People: “Everyone has been so generous to help our donkeys at Bleakholt. The donkeys are all real characters and deserve to have the best lives as many were abandoned or neglected in the past. “For people to have helped financially to make sure the stable is dry, weather-proof and snug for our donkeys, means a lot. They live out their lives at Bleakholt and now they have updated conditions to continue being well cared for.”  Sanctuary Manager Karen Weed added: “Thanks to the Sunday People we raised over our target and the donkeys are now living in lovely modernised stable with no rain coming in! “We have been able to get the roof fully done and now are looking to put new doors in place and repair the floor too. “It was an old building so all the donations have been a major boost and the donkeys love it. “We have donkeys and mules who have been abandoned but now they can live their lives out at our sanctuary in an up-to-date stable where they will be snug and content.” The new stable is a real boost for Flash who has barbed wire scars on his body from a past le. Fergus was seen being beaten up at a horse sale eight years ago and was bought by a kind person and given to Bleakholt.  “We love our donkeys and mules as they all have such dferent characters and personalities,” said joint Head of Stables Natalie Hill. “We have Hughie, a Mediterranean miniature donkey, who loves Ana, the only female donkey, and defends her honour. “There is Marty the mule who was living in a housing estate in Newcastle and being ridden around by children before he was brought here. “We have just got two new mules, two females as we are overrun by males! They have come from the Donkey Sanctuary – they are Dottie, who was abandoned at Appleby Fair, and Molly who was relinquished due to a previous owner’s change of circumstance. “They are settling in and we do have ‘donkey social workers’ from the Donkey Sanctuary who come and check that their donkeys and mules are all good.”The sanctuary always needs donations to cover the cost of looking after all their reduced animals.

Lton Parish Council has written to residents about the complaints of aposDarkey Laneapos and have askedthey want to change it or not. If residents choose to rename the road, it would be the responsibility of West Devon Borough Councilwhich would then do their own consultationa desire for change was expressed, DevonLive reports. The letter from January  reads: I have been asked to write to you on behalf of Lton Parish Council following receipt of a complaint about the street name Darkey Lane made by two visitors to the village. What do you think about this story  Let us know in the comments below  The visitors, one of who is of Caribbean heritage, were shocked and extremely upset having been confronted with a name like this. Councillors took the decision at a parish council meeting on November , , to undertake a public consultation with you in early January , to find outyou would like to keep or change the existing road name. It went on to explain that to rename the road, two-thirds of households on Darkey Lane would have to be in agreement. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Furthermore,they wanted to change the name then each household would have to pay £ to WDBC. The parish council have offered to pay for replacement road signs. Residents on the road would also be required to tell utility companies and all professional and personal contacts regarding any new road name. In the same letter, the parish council gave historical context on how the road got its name. It said: Darkey Lane was a historic, locally-based road name given before development in the local area. The road had originally been a sunken and tree-lined dark lane. Over the years and with the use of local Devonshire dialect, it became known as Darkey Lane. Robert Fleming, the owner of Lton Hall Hotel, is in favour of changing the roadaposs name. He said: I agree that the name should be changed. I think historically that the lane may have been called Darke Lane in the old English spelling, as indeed the lane is very dark and tree covered in places. The fact that the word ‘darkey’ has negative connotations, and has and continues to be used as such, supersedes historical spellings where they may have had a dferent meaning. People may be offended so it should be changed as standard, with a minimum of fuss. Indeed as a hotelier in the area, we have had people actually mention their surprise at the name of the lane as it is quite close to us. When I moved here  years ago I remember being rather shocked at it as we had moved down from London and lived in a multi-racial area of East London. Lton can not by any stretch of the imagination be classed as multi-racial. For people objecting to the change, I thinkthey could imagine themselves as being in a minority of some sort and then have a derogatory work on a street name that affected  upset them it may garner a dferent response. The name could be just Darke Lane or even Dark Lane which is minimal effort. In this advanced age we live in it should be a simple matter to change all the databases etc, although people may decide to live with it as it means changing passport  drivers licences and so on which obviously will incur some costs. Lton Parish Council said the results of the consultation will be reported at its next meeting later this month on January .

The worried parent captured the smouldering soil on camera this week and claimed thatyou were to fall into that there would be nothing left of you. Council chiefs said that a disused coal mine beneath the site is to blame for the burning of the field in East Ayrshire, in south-west Scotland. The field in Patna - which is on land owned by Forestry Land Scotland - continues to burn despite temperatures plummeting to below freezing in January.Dad Tam Paton has now claimed the area has been burning for more than three years and called for the fire to be put out, reports the Daily Record. The -year-old says mass parts of the area have aposfallen awayapos and aposturned to dustapos due to the searing heat. Shocking footage has shown smoke pouring out from the field which is just a  minute walk away from the village centre. Red hot pockets of a substance described like lava can be seen in pictures and videos taken by Tam.Tam told Ayrshire Live : “It’s been burning solid for the best part of three and half years. “It doesn’t matter how cold it gets, when we have snow it just melts away instantly. “It becomes worse in the summer months. “The smell is potent. You can smell the ground burning the minute you get near the field. “Bits of it have all turned to dust and fallen away. “It is over a vast area, about the size of a football pitch and itaposs only getting bigger.  Tam worries that the deadly field will lead to a tragedy one day. The dad claims that the Scottish Coal Board have tried to fence off the danger zone.  He added: “If you were to fall into that there would be nothing left of you. “It’s a real danger particularly with it being a popular spot for dog walkers and a lot of the kids like to go up that way at the weekend. “It would just take one wrong move and it would be a disaster. There is only two poles and a wee wire fence, it is definitely not enough protection from an area so dangerous. A spokesperson for East Ayrshire Council said: East Ayrshire Council was first made aware of this issue last summer and since then has continued to engage with both the landowner,, and the Coal Authority as the relevant regulatory body for such issues arising from former coal mining works, in order to ensure that the situation continues to be managed and to minimise any risk to public health and safety . In that regard the council is aware that appropriate safety measures were put in place, including fencing around the affected area, but unfortunately that has since been removed by unknown parties, which clearly isn’t helpful. The council will continue to engage with the relevant parties to ensure they fulfil their respective obligations, and in the meantime would advise members of the public to avoid the affected area and also ask them not to interfere with any safety measures which are, or might be put, in place for their own protection. Ayrshire Live contacted the UK coal mining community response team and Scottish First and Rescue for comment.

Estelle Wignall has stage four oian cancer which recently spread to her bowel and doctors have told her she is terminally ill.A mum to baby daughter, Brooke,  months, she has been offered palliative care.But Estelle insists she is up for the fight, and has launched a fundraising campaign through GoFundMe to seek treatment overseas.She says: “I feel as though I have been written off, but I am not ready to throw in the towel yet. I’ve bounced back before, and I am determined to do it again. To help Estelle raise money for treatment overseas, you can donate here. I want to celebrate my little girl’s second birthday, I want to see her start school, I want to mark as many milestones as I can.” Estelle, , from Wigan, Greater Manchester, was diagnosed with oian cancer five years ago after becoming tired and bloated. Doctors at first insisted she had IBS but her symptoms became so bad that she was rushed to hospital and then sent home again with medication. She said: “I picked up a leaflet in hospital about oian cancer and I immediately diagnosed myself. But everyone told me not to be so stupid because I was only  years old. “People said I was being a hypochondriac. Nobody took me seriously – but I just knew. It was an instinct.” Estelle pushed for tests and in February , she was finally diagnosed with grade one oian cancer. She had a tumour removed, along with her right oy and Fallopian tube. After making a full recovery, she put the cancer behind her, working as a receptionist and marrying soulmate Mike, , in June  in Texas. The couple had their first child, Brooke, in May . Estelle said: “I had only one oy and so to conceive so quickly felt like a miracle. I didn’t have my regular checks because I was pregnant, and during the birth the midwe actually noticed nodules on my cervix and I was referred for more tests, which came back clear. “We adored Brooke and the future looked fantastic.  “I was actually planning a hysterectomy so that there was no chance the cancer could .” But before her op, Estelle started to feel unwell, suffering from exhaustion and a lack of appetite. She said: “I had started the  week diet challenge, to get rid of my baby weight. I just needed to lose a stone, that was all. “But I started to feel very tired and I had no appetite. I thought it was all due to the diet – but it got worse and I began to think the cancer might be back.” In November , she was sent for urgent scans and was diagnosed with stage four cancer, which had spread to her liver and lungs.  She said: “I was devastated. The first time I had cancer, I coped well. But this time, because of Brooke, I was heartbroken. She was just six months old and it felt so cruel. I had only just started being a mum, and I didn’t want it to be taken away. She was initially told her le expectancy was only two or three years but her outlook improved after treatment and a raft of alternative therapies. “There have been points when I felt I could not go on. I considered euthanasia. But I kept going, and I got my spirits up again, she said. A recent scan showed the cancer has spread once again to the bowel and Estelle is now being warned that her time is fast running out. She says: “I’ve been on the brink before and I have bounced back and I am determined to do it again. I can’t give up, I have too much to live for, and I am determined to look for treatment abroad. “I hope also that my story can help other women, it is so important, no matter how young you are, to follow your instincts and to insist on answers. Don’t be fobbed off – it could cost you your le.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Oian cancerCancerHospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So she, her husband and kids have left the privately-rented apartment in Donisthorpe, Leicestershire, to sofa surf and even sleep in their car at times.But North West Leicestershire Council, controlled by the Conservative Party, says the family are not a priority because they are not at a genuine risk of homelessness. Speaking to Leicestershire Live, worried Kay said: Iaposm heartbroken. Myself and my partner are in tears every single day. We havenapost slept there since December  as we were horried. There are rats everywhere. When we first saw the rats, we all screamed and were horried. I rang the council but nobody believed me. I had to go out and buy a camera which I set up in the kitchen to capture them. They were all over the kitchen surface, floor and even in the cupboard where I keep my pots and pans.  Kay claims her children, aged , eight, three, two and five-months-old, have suffered sickness and diarrhoea as a result of the vermin. And she doesnapost want to risk their health by staying there any longer despite, she says, still having to pay the £ monthly rent. The landlord says it is not clearthe vermin are rats or field mice and they are working very closely with the environmental team and emergency housing team who are satisfied with the living conditions. But Kay continued: My children got so poorly - diarrhoea and vomiting that I had to take them out. Mentally, Iaposm breaking down. Every day my husbandaposs mental health is through the roof. My kids donapost know where they are sleeping from night to night. They scream when they have to go in there. I just canapost call it home anymore. I want out now. We keep being told we are not a priority. I have young children and a five month old, I donapost see how this is possible. I just want a safe place to live for myself, my husband and my children. Kayaposs mother-in-law, Ruth Neal says she is heartbroken for what her loved ones have had to go through. The gran said: Iaposm worried sick for my family. They have had it rough for the last four weeks. Iaposve had both my son and daughter-in-law in tears every single day and every time they enter the building, my grand kids are ill. I just want them all in a safe environment. The council should be providing emergency accommodation for them. I just want to see my family happy and safe.  A spokesperson for Kayaposs landlord said: We have been working very closely for quite some time with the environmental team and emergency housing to address any concerns from the tenants. Pest control has been out and the environmental team have inspected the property and are happy with the living conditions. Inside the property, there is a large hole in the kitchen floor which was not there before the tenants moved in. They have been advised to cover this up as it suspected that this is how the vermin are entering the property. Similarly, the tenants have been advised to clear away some rubbish that has been left out which could attract the vermin. The council have received all the reports of all inspections that have been carried out and they are very happy with the progress we have been making. There are a few jobs that we need to do and there have been tradesmen at the property every day this week working on them. The environmental team also inspected the downstairs of the Masons and found no infestation.Andy Barton, Strategic Director atNorth West Leicestershire District Council, said: We canapost comment on inidual circumstances, but we are aware of the familyaposs situation and are working with them and are in touch with the landlord to ensure the property is safe and habitable.Rental homes must be fit to live in and kept in a reasonable state of repair, so where properties do not meet this standard we work with tenants and their landlords to make improvements. If someone is threatened with homelessness within  days we will work with them to try and prevent homelessness either by assisting them to remain where they are or by supporting them in a planned move.

Which is just as well as he’s NEVER going to find a new squeeze after the latest bedroom revelations. Not the sex abuse ones which, of course, Prince Andrew vehemently denies and still has a chance to defend himself in a US legal action. But in the court of public opinion he has been well and truly stuffed by the details of his cuddly toy fetish. A former servant has disclosed that ­after his orce from Fergie in  Andrew kept a ­collection of  teddies and other ­animals lined up with ­military precision on his Buckingham Palace bed.  Every night the maid had to move the heir bear bunch to set positions around the room so that they “looked pretty”. The small ones dressed in sailor unorms were ranked by size order in an unused fireplace and his two favourite bears sat on ickle thrones on either side of the bed. Then, in the morning, she had to put them all back again, using a diagram to ensure they were correctly positioned. Becauseso much as a whisker was out of place the Queen’s favourite son would scweam and scweam like a toddler having a tantrum. This all sounded so bizarre that I ­wonderedAndrew was going through some sort of post-orce breakdown at the time – especially as the maid says he also kept Fergie’s make-up on his dressing table and her wedding gown in the wardrobe. But another insider has revealed that Andrew STILL sleeps with a little gang of furry friends. And staff also keep a list of instructions showing where Heart-Holding Teddy sits and how Grey Hippo should be placed on the bed on top of a special green blankie.  Crikey. I know that ­millions of grown men still cherish a childhood teddy. But Andrew’s menagerie would make most women run a mile. Because we all know there is something deeply dodgy about a bloke who keeps piles of soft toys on his bed. It suggests that he still sucks his thumb, likes wearing nappies and will want to call you Mummy while you dust his bottom with talcum powder. But I’m sure loyal Sarah is well used to Andy’s Toy Story fantasies by now. So we can only hope that they tie the knot soon – and buzz off to infinity and beyond.

Charlotte has also been keen to point out while she considered Prince Andrewaposs attitude poor, she never witnessed any inappropriate behaviour. The Duke is facing a civil trial after being accused of sexual abuse by a trafficking victim of his late paedophile pal billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein. Virginia Giuffre is suing Andrew for allegedly having sex with her in the US when she was .  He vehemently denies her allegations and has not been charged with any criminal offence.Speaking to the Daily Mail outside her home on Friday, Charlotte said: I donapost give a toss what Prince Andrew feels…he is a horrible, nasty man.She explained she had signed a privacy agreement under the Official Secrets Act not to ulge any accounts of her time at the Palace. But on seeing ITVaposs documentary this week - which included claims by another ex-staff member that Andrew had a map for exactly where his cuddly toys needed to be on the bed - she decided to breach it.The mum-of-two said: I am not sorry at all. But I have been hurt by some of the remarks against me. In her original interview, she said Andrewaposs brothers Prince Charles and Prince Edward, as well as all other royals she encountered, were wonderful. She was just  when she started work at the Palace and started working for Andrew when he was  - at a time when he had recently orced from Sarah Ferguson. Charlotte was paid £ a month and was pictured on the royal balcony ahead of the Trooping the Colour ceremony the same year. It comes as the Queen stripped the Duke of his royal titles and patronages ahead of his trial in New York and he is facing eviction from the Royal Lodge in Windsor.

The pair stepped back as senior members of the royal family in .And it has now been claimed this would be a catastrophic blow for Harry, who it emerged last year has relinquished his royal patronages.Being removed, by parliament no less, as a Counsellor of State would really be the nail in Harry’s coffin of his former le as a frontline member of the royal family, a source told the Daily Mail. If the Queen does take steps to have this situation remedied and Harry is axed, there really is no going back. All of these decisions – the military titles, the HRHs in abeyance – could theoretically be reversed. However, having parliament take formal action to remove them as Counsellors of State is in another league entirely.

He finally relented when his mum intervened, according to an ex-maid. Former Buckingham Palace staff member Janette McGowan - who had travelled with the Firm to the residence in Norfolk - revealed Andrewaposs childish tantrum, said to have happened over Christmas . She said astonished colleagues were alerted to the situation after the Duke put his things into the wrong bathroom and then refused to move them.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here  Charles would have been  at the time.Ms McGowan told The Sun : We were told not to move anything and not to touch anything in that bathroom because there was an aposongoing situationapos.She explained that when members of the family travel to Sandringham - where the monarch usually hosts her annual festive lunches - they are each allocated rooms and bathrooms. But on this occasion Andrew took the wrong one and wouldnapost budge, the former maid continued, adding: It turned into a bizarre stand-off.  In the end, the Queen herself had to intervene to defuse the situation. She actually had to have words with Andrew and say to him that he had to use the other bathroom and that was when he finally backed down. He was almost  at the time. It was very odd behaviour for someone of that age. She added, in contrast, Prince Charles was very grown-up about it and simply waited for the Queen to step in. Ms McGowan, , worked at the Palace from  to , and said the strangest thing was there was nothing special about the bathroom, but rather Andrew seemed to resent Charles being regarded as superior.  He arrived first and put his toiletries in a bathroom that wasnapost opposite his bedroom, she said.It comes after another former maid said she had no regrets in speaking out against Andrew who she described as a horrible man.Charlotte Briggs claimed the Duke of York often erupted into demanding and entitled foul-mouthed rants which left her in tears.The -year-old, who lives in Halax, West Yorkshire, made front-page news this week when she revealed her experiences doing the job nobody wanted six months after starting work for the royals in January .

The concerns are thought to have emerged due to the contingency plans in place were the Queen, now -years-old, to fall ill or be abroad and unable to lead the monarchy as a result.Roles historically held by five people, known as the Counsellors of State, would stand in position to take over - but among those are two figures likely to cause concern for Her Majesty. There are currently only four Counsellors, Princes Andrew, Charles, William and Harry following the death of Prince Philip.The pair are her son Prince Andrew and grandson Prince Harry who, for dferent reasons, are unable to fulfil the duty. Harry is no longer allowed to act on behalf of the Queen because he moved to LA and isnapost domiciled in the UK, while Andrew was ousted from the family due to his ongoing civil sex case trial - he denies all wrongdoing. Neither is currently a working member of The Firm. They are among the Councillors currently because they are within the top four people in line to the throne and are over the age of . The Counsellors of State would normally oversee matters such as the appointment of High Court judges or give Royal Assent to bills as they pass through parliament.  It has now been suggested by royal insiders that an act of parliament could be tabled to boot Andrew and Harry. It is thought the Duchess of Cornwall could be in the frame for a promotion to fill the role, while Princess Anne and Prince Edward could also be considered. But the pair wouldnapost be the only royals in the history of The Firm to be stripped of roles or titles. The Mirror takes a look at some of the more notable cases where members have received the boot, including details of the two current examples. Prince Andrew stripped of royal and military titles  In January , Prince Andrew was stripped of his military roles by the Queen due to the ongoing court case linking him to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The case emerged after Virginia Giuffre alleged she had been abused by Andrew when she was aged . The move caused an abrupt transition from senior royal to a private citizen, with the prince also being left to meet his own extremely costly legal bills without help from the Queen. Anticipation of the upcoming costs has seen Andrew try to sell his £.million Verbier ski chalet to foot the expenses. Prince Harry stripped of royal titles  Prince Harry has also been shut out of the family since January  he and his we Meghan Markle left the UK to forge careers in America.The move came at the cost of the princeaposs military roles as well as all of his patronages. The stripping of his military rank means he is no longer Captain General of the Royal Marines, a title he inherited from his grandfather, the late Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.Speaking at the time, Buckingham Palace said he and Meghan would no longer receive public money infor their royal duties and were “required to step back from royal duties, including official military appointments”. He is now known as Harry, Duke of Sussex and although he does technically still have his HRH title he does not use it. Harry, who was born in Wales, is still technically a prince of Wales by birthright, and retains his line of succession to the throne.Meghan Markleaposs exit from Royal Family Prince Harryaposs we, Meghan Markle, also left The Firm in January  when she moved with Harry to LA. She too no longer uses her aposHer Royal Highnessapos title.Like Harry, she now goes by the title of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. However, her children, Archie and Lilibet, do not currently use any royal titles due to convention that holds only the grandchildren of the reigning monarch can be princes and princesses. This may well change when Charles is crowned king. Lili was born in Santa Barbra, Calornia and it remains to be seen how the two siblings grow up in relation to their royal background. Speaking during the coupleaposs now-famous interview with Oprah Winfrey in March , Meghan said: “They were saying they didn’t want him [Archie] to be a prince or princess, which would be dferent from protocol, and that he wasn’t going to receive security.” Princess Dianaaposs orce  Harryaposs mother, Princess Diana, was also stripped of her royal titles when her  orce from Prince Charles was finalised. Following her bombshell BBC Panorama interview with Martin Bashir, where Diana said there were “three of us” in her marriage to Charles Camilla , the Queen wrote a letter to the princess saying: “I have consulted with the Archbishop of Canterbury and with the prime minister and, of course, with Charles, and we have decided that the best course for you is orce.”Diana died a year later in a tragic car incident in Paris. Edward VIIIaposs abdication  In , Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry American orcée Wallis Simpson. The move saw his brother, King George VI, ascend to the throne - and start a new offshoot in the family. Having only ascended to the throne in January of the same year, his December abdication saw himto the title of Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor. Edward and his future we Wallis had met in , two years before their marriage, with his proposal for their union strongly opposed by both the government and the crown. This was because, at the time, the Church of England did not allow orced people to remarry in its churches. Ultimately, after  days on the throne, Edward gave it all up to be with Wallis.

She had also struggle to grieve her mother who died when Samantha was just , and this led to a bout of depression.But when KFC, McDonaldaposs and other fast food restaurants were forced to shut for a few months at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the council worker began cooking her own meals for the first time in years.And in the  months or so since, sheaposs shed more than nine stone and dropped seven dress sizes to around a size .  Samantha, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, said: “I thought thatI didn’t do something, I was going to end up twice the size coming out of lockdown as I did going into it. My diet before was KFC, takeaway, chocolate - anything I wanted. Nothing was off limits. I was having food delivered pretty much every night. Then everything shut and that was taken away from me. When things started opening up again, I realised I quite liked cooking for myself and knowing what was in my food. It completely changed my eating habits.  The womanaposs diet is now a contrast to that before the pandemic as, these days, she regularly has a nutritious protein shake for breakfast, a sandwich or omelette for lunch, a healthy colourful meal for dinner, which will include chicken, fish, vegetables, salad and sweet potato, and she snacks on fruit, hummus and protein bars. She also works out four times a week and tries to get , steps in every day. Even after May  when restrictions started to ease, and Samantha’s old favourites like McDonald’s and KFC were serving up food for takeaway again, the woman stuck rigidly to her new diet. Samantha was always larger than her peers when she was growing up. She piled on more and more weight though when her mother died.  She continued: “Even as a child, I remember being overweight. I went on a school trip when I was about seven and we did so much walking, I came back and my mum hardly recognised me. “When I was , my mum passed away very suddenly and I became afor my two sisters. “Eating was just about convenience and as I slid deeper into depression, I ate what I wanted to make myself feel good because nothing  really did. “No one could tell me what I should and shouldn’t eat because I was an adult, looking after two kids.” Samantha had tried to lose weight at dferent points in her le but had never managed to do it in a sustainable way.  She said: “In , one of my best friends got married and I was asked to be a bridesmaid alongside girls who were a size . We ordered these dresses online and I got a size . “It arrived and mine was too small to fasten so I took it to a seamstress but she looked at it and looked at me and told me there just wasn’t enough material. “I searched for a bigger size but it was the biggest they went so I knew the only way I could go to the wedding was to lose weight.  “I went full throttle lost two and a half stone in six weeks and went to the wedding but I did it in a really unsustainable way and I couldn’t keep it up. After the wedding, I went straight back to how I was eating before. But now I’m exercising four to five times a week and don’t feel tired. Before I would want to nap all the time and I just didn’t have the energy for little things like cleaning. “You don’t realise how bad things were until you’re not in it any more. “I feel like I am the person I always should have been now.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON KFCChocolateWeight loss success stories\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The former college student, from Highfields, South Yorkshire, had been studying law with dreams of going to university and becoming a lawyer - but they were crushed overnight when she was diagnosed with Chiari Malformation.The condition, which causes ligaments in the spine to be tense and tighter than usual, sees the brain tissue of its victims pulled into their spinal cord and can eventually lead to paralysis. It can lead to so-called internal decapitation, when the ligaments that connect the skull to the spine are severed. Petried by the prognosis, Allesha has opted not to be told by doctors how long she has before this happens. Have you got an inspiring story to tell  Email webnews@mirror She said: “This condition has ruined my le. I had dreams of becoming a lawyer and going to university but I can’t go anymore. “I spend every day confined in my room in complete darkness because I can’t bear the light. “I find the smallest noises excruciatingly painful, even when someone is talking to me I have to ask them to whisper. “When they told me what would eventually happen to me I just broke down. “I asked them not to tell me how long I had based on my scans because I just don’t think I can handle knowing. I feel like a walking death sentence.”Allesha, who lives with her sister and was diagnosed by an NHS doctor in September , is not eligible for surgery on the health service.The teen took matters into her own hands when she claimed that teachers and doctors refused to accept she was really suffering.  Allesha said: “It wasnapost until  that I started getting these horrible headaches. “I have had migraines before but I knew that these weren’t migraines because I could physically feel the back of my head shocking me. “It started out as once a week but then it got to the point where it was everyday, all day. “I took myself to the doctors and I was desperately trying to get people to believe me and listen to me. “I felt like I was being treated like a child, which I know I am but I also know my own body “Eventually one GP finally listened to me and I was referred for an MRI and to a neurosurgeon. “He told me I had Chiari Malformation but never really explained what it was or what that meant.” After researching Chiari Malformation, Allesha discovered a clinic in Barcelona who are offering a new kind of surgery which promises to eliminate the condition for its victims altogether. In the UK, surgeons use a method called decompression surgery whereby a piece of bone is removed from the spinal cord to relieve the pressure - but there is a risk that the tension will build up again causing the same problem in future. At the Filum System clinic, Spanish doctors say their minimally invasive technique allows them ‘eliminate the root cause and stop further progression of the condition’.  But the costly procedure will set back Allesha £, who has now set up a GoFundMe to cover the procedure and medical expenses.Allesha said: “I suffer with crippling back pain and neck pain, sickness and fatigue. “Before this started I was about to start volunteering in a law firm and I was at college but I had to quit. “From the very beginning I have been dealing with this by myself. “To get this surgery and have my le back would mean everything, I just want to be alive.”The NHS was approached for comment.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSBack painTeenagersPeople\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Another boy, found guilty of manslaughter for his part in the brutal stabbing of -year-old Reece, was jailed for six years. A court heard that the attackers - named Boy A and Boy B for legal reasons - had agreed to meet up in the early hours of May  in Walker Avenue, Bolton, because of an escalating dispute between Boy B and a friend of the victim. But when Reece arrived he was stabbed six times by Boy A. He banged on the door of a nearby house desperately pleading for help before falling to the ground. And, having been discovered by two men, he used his final breath to tell them the names of his killers.  Police arrived at the scene minutes later and Reece was rushed to Salford Royal Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at .am. A pathologist concluded his death was caused by multiple stab wounds, which were likely to have been inflicted by a kne with a -cm blade. After fleeing the scene, Boy A sent a Snapchat video of himself carrying a kne covered in blood, accompanied by the word muppet. He later sent a message to Boy B, which read: I thought it only went through his coat so I kept doing it. Adding: Heaposs dead now. Boy B responded with a laughing emoji.  Both teenagers appeared at a sentencing hearing at Manchester Crown Court todaywhere judge Justice Farbey was told there was a long-standing hate between Boy B and Reece, and Boy A had been brought into the dispute as support. During a three-week trial, jurors heard that the two boys had goaded Reece and his friend into meeting them, but he was initially reluctant. The court heard he had sent a message to his friend, which read: Getting brought into your s* again. Ainapost in no f**** mood. All four boys eventually agreed to meet that night and Reece left home and headed to the rendezvous point near Great Lever Park. But as Reece was en route, his friend informed him that he had decided to stay in bed.  Before the trial Boy A admitted to killing Reece but denied murder. Boy B admitted he was there but denied killing Reece or knowing Boy A had a kne. Richard Wright QC, who represented Boy A in the trial, told the court how the dispute was part of a petty subculture brought on via social media. Mr Wright said: It is a fact that they were all young people and a fact that their culture, that all of them engaged in, driven by social media led to them meeting up. He added: It might be said that all were particularly vulnerable due to their age, from being drawn into this petty sub-culture of social media interactions and bravado. They were all vulnerable to that and unfortunately one of them lost their le.  In a victim statement read out in court, Reeceaposs mum Laura said: Reece was our -year-old son, he made us smile, he made us laugh, he made us tear our hair out at times, a typical teenage lad, but he was ours. Reece was fiercely protective of his mum and little brother and saw himself as the man of the house. His dad saw him as his best friend. Reece was simply our world, and his death has devastated us beyond belief. Boy A was handed a -year-old sentence while Boy B was jailed for six years.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Court caseHospitalsCrown courtMurder trialCrimeTeenagersKne crime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

People have had to wrap up warm this week with temperatures dropping down to -C on Friday but while the mercury is starting to rise, the winter is not yet over. Maps for WXCharts show that temperatures are set to drop to sub zero around January  and the first week of February is expected to see heavy snow fall. On February  the mercury could fall to as low as -C in Scotland while there could be up to cm of snow in the far north west of the UK. In England there could be up to eight centimetres falling in Manchester.  Looking to this weekend it will be cold and cloudy for many areas with a high pressure but without the severe sub zero temperatures.“For most the winds are going to be light but there is likely to be a lot of cloud about,” said Met Office forecaster Alex Deakin.“For most we will be staying above freezing thanks to that cloud. The thick cloud in the North West still bringing a bit of drizzle and rain for the Highland and the western isles, quite breezy here as well so that will keep the temperatures up here to C or C. Most towns or cities C or C and as I said some pockets of frost are still possible where the skies stay clear. And where the skies stay clear it should lead to some sunshine on Saturday morning but that will be in short supply.”  It is likely to be cloudy for most with the sunny spells more likely in the south of the country. There could be rain in the north west of England while in Scotland with the cloud covering it will be far milder with temperatures possibly up to C. It will continue to get milder going into Sunday. Mr Deakin continued: “Similar story for Sunday with some breaks in the cloud so some sunshine possible for some parts. “Temperatures will get up to C or C a little higherwe do see any spells of sunshine coming through.  Today: Cloudy across many areas, especially the northwest where some light rain and drizzle is likely. Some brighter spells developing, mainly in the east. Rather chilly in the south, but temperatures above average in the north. Tonight: Most parts dry but rather cloudy. A few clear spells possible with some isolated frost and fog. Windy in the far northwest with a little rain or drizzle on hills. Sunday: Cloudy and windy in the northwest with further rain or drizzle on hills. Dry but often rather cloudy where, though a few sunny spells are possible. Outlook for Monday to Wednesday: Often cloudy, dry for most central and southern parts of the country rather cold. Patchy frost and fog, most likely Tuesday morning. Elsewhere, often breezy with rain at times mild.

Kerry Lyn Caviasca allegedly left her children, both below the age of , home alone for two days in November.Caviasca, a teacher from Connecticut, is accused of leaving the children to survive on sweets and Uber deliveries while she went on holiday to Florida and partied with her boyfriend, according to court documents obtained by NBC Connecticut.Caviasca’s ex-husband reported her police in December. He claimed both children missed school on Monday, November , and he was unable to contact them over the weekend. Court documents claim he told police he sent his own father to the house to check on them, but he wasn’t able to reach the children. When the concerned father later asked the children whether they had been left home alone, they told him no, reports the New York Post. But after going through messages on a phone he had brought for one of the children, he reportedly saw a number of messages between Caviasca and the children over the course of the weekend in question. Some of the messages reportedly show the children asking their mother what they should eat for dinner, with her allegedly replying Just eat candy and What ever [sic] is downstairs. Police arrived at Caviasca’s home after initial reports, but she originally claimed her brother had been looking after the children - before eventually admitting they had been left alone. Caviasca was arrested on January  and charged with two counts of risk of injury to a minor and two counts of reckless endangerment in the second degree, according to NBC Connecticut. She is to appear in court on Jan. . Waterbury Public Schools district said Caviasca had been placed on leave while the district conducts its own investigation.

Mum Stephanie Reyes, from Los Angeles, has spoken about how her family has suffered two tragedies after her son Anthony Reyes Jr was unable to overcome the loss of his father and she now wants to highlight the seriousness of depression in children. Last August the family of five was looking forward positively, having moved to a new home in the Whittier neighbourhood but then they all picked up Covid at a school sports pep rally.The condition of the dad Anthony Reyes Sr, , who had a pre-existing heart condition, quickly deteriorated and he died after being put on a ventilator on September , reported the Los Angeles Times.Stephanie said that before he died, she allowed her -year-old son Anthony Jr to see him and feels now it was a big mistake as it had a very bad impact on him - having already felt responsible for him getting Covid.  The teen was left haunted with the images of his dad with blood building in the corner of his eye and also being the last member of the family to see his dad alive.My son wanted to go see his dad, against my better judgement, I let him go. It was the worst mistake I did, she told Fox . He felt guilty. He felt like he was the one who got us sick. He felt like he was the reason why his dad was gone and we talked to him all the time, and told him aposIt wasnapost your faultapos.” She is frustrated that she was not able to get professional help for her son’s depression and claims that therapists she tried to contact were all booked up.  Then tragically on December  she woke around am and going to investigate after having seen a light on in her son’s room, she found that he had taken his own le. I knock on the door to his room and Iaposm like, aposhey, kid, itaposs  in the morning, what are you doing apos, Stephanie said. He was gone. I couldnapost believe my baby’s gone. Stephanie, , has now been left to look after her two surviving daughters Reyna and Marissa herself.A funeral service is being held this Saturday, January , for Anthony Jr and a gofundme page has been set up to help pay for costs. A message on the gofundme page reads: Hi, as many of you know our family lost Anthony Sr. four months ago, and sadly Papiwas taken from us way too early. He was only  years young and had his whole le ahead of him. He was the happiest kid ever and had the most contagious smile and laugh that would brighten anyoneaposs day. We are absolutely devastated by the sudden loss of Papi. He was a Son, a brother, a grandson, a cousin, and most of all a friend, and to all of us, he was family. At this time we are asking for help in funding his funeral during these hard times, any and all donations will be greatly appreciated.If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

Christina Darling, , has been charged with aggravated harassment and menacing, both as hate crimes, and acting in a manner that could injure a child. It is alleged she approached the children outside an Orthodox synagogue in New York City last Friday and yelled the offensive slur. Darling also spat at the oldest sibling, an eight-year-old boy, police say. The authorities say the other children are aged seven and two. Hitler should have killed you all,’ Darling allegedly told the kids. I’ll kill you and know where you live.  Surveillance video captures the defendant, a psychology student, appearing to shout at the youngsters. It shows Darling, wearing an orange sweatshirt, walking on a New York City street and then approaching the siblings. It then captures Darling leave back towards where she came from. The incident was reported to police, who investigated and confirmed the charge on Twitter yesterday. The tweet said the charge was made possible thanks to help from the public.  Aryah Fried, the siblingsapos father, said: I would hope that she understands the severity of what she did. To do it to anybody is obviously problematic but for an adult to do it to a child is beyond crazy. We also teach our kids to look out for people that look like moms when they feel unsafe. And this woman looks like a person that might have been a safe looking person for the kids. So, what do we tell them now A petition has been created by fellow students at St. Francis College calling for Darlingaposs expulsion. The petition is live on Change.org.It reads: I urge President Miguel Martinez-Saenz to stand by his promises and denounce this horrying act of racism, bigotry, and harassment against the Jewish people. If appropriate disciplinary action isnapost taken, an egregious precedent will be set.

Many fans were surprised at the fact that Alex seemed to have forgotten her shoes, with many tweeting out about their confusion, but host Bradley Walsh seemed unfazed. What do you think of Alexaposs unusual outfit choice  Let us know in the comments...One viewer said: Is that woman on the chase not wearing shoes  How has she forgotten her shoes ! observed another fan, while a third person said: Looks like she has no shoes on, that’s very strange. I hope Alex wins some money, she needs to get herself some shoes, a fourth social media user joked. A fth shocked fan commented: How on earth can you just forget your shoes  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. Alex answered seven questions correctly, which earned her £, to take through to the next round. Bradley welcomed Alex up to the podium and she explained that she would use her prize money to take her husband to Mauritius, where they went on their honeymoon. Along with two of her teammates, Alex made it through to the final chase, but they were unsuccessful in defeating the beast, Mark Labbett, and walked away empty-handed.Meanwhile, Ben Shephard was left in stitches when a contestant on TV game show Tipping Point thought that the Loch Ness monster was a type of snake. The host of the ITV gameshow struggled to contain himself after he asked for the name of a breed of snake native to Britain thataposs a member of the viper family.Would-be winner Josh, a student from Manchester, was confident he knew the answer and hit his buzzer first - but when the camera turned to him he blurted out the Loch Ness monster. Ben, who used to front Channel Fouraposs Bigger Breakfast, stled a laugh that soon broke through and he was struggling to regain composure as he told Josh that he was, unfortunately, incorrect.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Now I fully disagree and so did my family and my aunt. My girlfriend was admittedly dressed slightly less conservative than the other women but I wouldn’t call what she was wearing immodest at all. I told my girlfriend and asked hershe would dress more conservatively next time.  Earlier this week, ahead of this monthaposs dinner, the man asked his girlfriend to show him what she planned to wear for the family gathering this weekend, and when she did, he was disappointed. Again, it wasn’t immodest, but just less conservative and I know it’d p*** my grandmother off again. She said no, as she really liked the dress and it was modest. I told her that what’s modest to her isn’t going to be what’s modest to a -year-old woman andshe wanted to buy a dress I’d pay for it, but she refused. The couple continued to argue and in the end, he told his girlfriend thatshe refused to change her dress it would be better for her to just not come this month and they can find a solution for next time. She told me I was being unreasonable and putting an old woman’s outdated views over her freedom, but I feel like I was being very reasonable, the man added, before turning to Reddit to hear their opinions on the matter. If you want a future with somebody, stand up for them instead of just obliging by your familyaposs opinions. If your grandma is judging her because she doesnapost want to wear a potato sack, thataposs on grandma, one Reddit user suggested. However, another disagreed: Itaposs your grandmotheraposs home and invite and she has one requirement. I get it her body, her choice but what the younger generation of today needs to get a grip with is you need to pick your God damn battles because fighting a dress war with an elderly grandma who probably wonapost be around much longer is ridiculous. Your grandmother is never ever ever going to understand this hard line. She just wonapost. Your fiance is being childish.

Although busy schedules can sometimes get in the way of giving your bed a refresh, experts at the Sleep Foundation have revealed that we should all be washing our bed sheets at least once a week - insisting that every couple of weeks doesnapost cut it.And in some cases, you should be washing your sheets even more than the recommended amount of once a week. Experts have suggested that someone who suffers from asthma or allergies should wash their sheets more frequently to improve overall wellbeing.  Andyouaposre someone who sleeps with a beloved dog or cat, then you should consider throwing your sheets in the washing up to twice a week to get rid of germs and bacteria that your furry friends may have carried from their outdoor adventures. If youaposre someone who likes to eat snacks when in bed, you should also be washing your sheets more than once a week. And people who go to bed without showering, or people who sleep naked, should also follow suit and stock up on some extra washing powder.  The biggest mistake many of us make is leaving our bedding on for more than a week, as they warn it leads to us apossleeping while surrounded by body oils, bacteria, dead skin cells, and dust mitesapos. Keeping your bed clean and hygienic can help thwart germs and allergens, and has even been found to help you sleep better. When it comes to your duvet, it doesnapost need washing as often as your sheets, but itaposs always good to give them a good clean every now and then - ideally every two months.

Amy Wainman, , from Cape Town, was swimming off Simon’s Town in South Africa’s Western Cape when she captured the bizarre creature on camera. In Amy’s footage, the creature - whose transparent body appears to be devoid of any major organs - is seen undulating through the water. Amy said it was unlike anything she’d ever seen before. “When I first saw it, it almost looked like some floating plastic,” she said. “But then it started swimming. It was like a dancing, clear ribbon. “I had no idea what it was, I had never even seen a picture of one before. It was an amazing, magical creature to see!” Bradley Stevens, a retired marine science professor, formerly of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, has suggested that the footage shows an eel larva at the end of its larval stage. He said: “Its size and location suggest that it is nearing the end of its migration from the mid-oceanic spawning grounds, and will soon become a normal-shaped juvenile eel.” However Kevin Kocot, an associate professor at The University of Alabama specialising in invertebrate zoology, believes it’s actually a “very unusual” type of jelly.  He said: “Some baby eels have larvae called leptocephalus larvae that look superficially very similar. “Butyou look closely, they have a head and mouth at one end whereas this animal’s mouth is in the middle of the body. “This is a cestum veneris, a very unusual comb jelly or ctenophore. “Most comb jellies are more-or-less rounded in shape and swim with ‘combs’ – rows of cilia – but this speciesswims by undulating muscles like a ribbon.” Dr Kocot said that the creature, better known as a Venus girdle, survives on a diet of “ious planktonic animals like little crustaceans and fish fry”.He said: “This one looks like it has a mouth full of food, but I can’t make out what it’s got from the video.” He added that they are safe to touch, but not to eat, and that they reproduce by laying many tiny eggs. For Amy, the experience was one of a kind. “It was the first and last time I have ever seen one,” she said. “It was something very special to see I have snorkelled all over the world so it was great to see something so cool in my hometown. I hope I will see one again someday. “It was an unusual day of snorkelling as we actually saw several dferent types of comb jellies that we had never seen and have not seen since.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON University of AlabamaRare animals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Another airstrike on Friday hit a telecommunications building in the port city of Hodeidah, causing a nationwide internet blackout.At least three children were killed as they played football at the time of that attack alone, Save the Children said.The Norwegian Refugee Council said the internet blackout, which was still ongoing as of Friday evening, would affect aid delivery, reports CNN.  The Saudi-led military coalition has been fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen since . The coalition said the report of dozens of deaths on Friday would be investigated using an internationally approved, independent process. Tens of thousands of civilians, including more than , children, have been killed or wounded as a direct result of the fighting. Millions have been displaced and much of the population stands on the brink of famine. The conflict has its roots in the failure of a political process supposed to bring stability to Yemen following an uprising in . Long-time authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, eventually handed power to his deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi who struggled to deal with growing unrest. The Houthi movement took advantage of the new Presidentaposs weakness. Many ordinary Yemenis - including Sunnis - supported them, and in late  and early  the rebels gradually took over the capital, Sanaa.

There were many contributing factors according to the sherf, some of which would have been avoided with the crystal clear benefit of hindsight.As the sherf noted, the owners took pride in their vessel, kept it well maintained and considered it to be a safe boat. They were managing it little dferently to many others up and down the Scottish coast.But, crucially, no stability rules applied to boats like the Nancy Glen at the time of the accident.Duncan MacDougall was an experienced fisherman who knew these waters well and,it could happen to his boat, there is an obvious need to raise awareness to prevent such devastating accidents in future."},{"url":null,"title":"martin-scott-qualities-manager-says-derek-adams","story":"BRADFORD City manager Derek Adams believes that Martin Scott and Steve Craig have the qualities and character to succeed at Gala Fairydean Rovers.Adams played with Scott under Paul Lambert at Livingston and with Craig at Aberdeen.

It’s dficult being a young manager and I explained to him that he has to use the experience he picked up as a player and take things from managers that he played under. I know he has worked for some very good managers, but he has to look at how they dealt with things and decided which he liked and which he didn’t like.“Him and Steveare very dferent characters although both have tempers and both have the ability to look after people so either one could be the good cop or the bad cop.“Jimmy is one of the funniest characters in Scottish football but now he will have to become a disciplinarian at times.“We spoke for over an hour on the phone last week and I was delighted to learn that he had been appointed manager of Gala Fairydean Rovers and had brought Stevein as his assistant.“They were both great for me at Ross County and were part of a really good group of players and I’m sure that they have what’s needed to be a success in the Borders.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-man-put-hands-round-partners-throat-given-work-order","story":"A BORDERS man who assaulted his partner by putting his hands around her throat has been ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work at Jedburgh Sherf Court.Lee Inglis, of Hawick, pleaded guilty to the assault at the house in the towns Fairhurst Drive last month.He also admitted threatening or abusive behaviour at his mothers home in Hawick during which he took possession of a kne and threatened to kill his former partner.Defence lawyer Ed Hulme said his client had recognised he was losing control and had asked his mother to contact the police.A non-harassment order involving the former partner was imposed for six months.You might also be interested in:Borders man claimed he had crossbow during police stand-off, court hearsNew pothole-filling machinewont solve all the problems on Borders roadsJedburgh Sherf Court: Borders man admits stalking offence"},{"url":null,"title":"your-dog---responsibility-say-campaigners","story":"A CAMPAIGN to protect Scotland’s livestock has been launched following new legislation which protects animals from dog attacks through a range of measures.These include fines up to £, and prison sentences for owners who let their pets worry, kill or injure farmed animals.SPARC, the Scottish Partnership Against Rural Crime, has launched the Livestock Attack and Distress campaign with the slogan: ‘Your Dog – Your Responsibility’ to educate dog owners about the new legislation plus.Under the new legislation, camelids such as llamas and alpacas, together with ostriches, game birds and farmed deer are now protected plus the inclusion of the word “attack” is welcomed as this clearly reflects the more serious aspect of such an incident.The campaign will run through the lambing season, when sheep and lambs are most vulnerable to attacks and will be then run again in the autumn.Inspector Alan Dron, Police Scotland National Rural Crime Co-ordinator said: “Attacks on livestock by dogs is an emotive issue that impacts on rural communities throughout Scotland therefore Police Scotland welcomes this new legislation which can hopefully assist in preventing, reducing and tackling such instances.“Its introduction is timely given the increase in dog ownership experienced during COVID and the aim of the campaign is designed to educate and raise awareness amongst dog owners, whether new or experienced, that their dog is very much their responsibility.”Mark McBrearty, Regional Manager for Scotland at NFU Mutual, said: “Dog attacks are causing appalling suffering to animals and huge anxiety for farmers and crofters as they deal with the aftermath. The new legislation is a huge step forward as it means farmers and police are able to trace offending dogs’ owners and impose serious penalties.“We’re supporting the ‘Your Dog - Your Responsibility’ campaign to spread the message about the new law and encourage irresponsible dog owners to control their pets. We want people to enjoy the countryside as it’s so important for people’s wellbeing. It’s vital that dog owners act responsibly and keep dogs under control whenever there is a possibility that livestock are nearby.”.removeThe need for robust legislation was further demonstrated by an NFU Mutual survey last year which showed that % of UK dog owners let their pets roam free in the countryside, despite half admitting their dog doesn’t always come back when called."},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-trio-hogg-sutherland-darcy-scotland-squad","story":"There is a strong Borders contingent in Gregor Townsend’s -man squad for the upcoming Guinness Six Nations ties.Stuart Hogg continues as captain and is joined in the squad by fellow Hawick pair Rory Sutherland and Darcy Graham.Boston born Rufus McLean who started his rugby journey with Melrose Minis is also in the squad along with ex-Melrose and Southern Knights flanker Rory Darge.Bath centre Cameron Redpath, son of ex-Scotland and Melrose scrum-half Bryan Redpath, s after missing out in recent games due to injury.The squad will meet up at Oriam on Monday  January for a training camp before reconvening the following week ahead of the Calcutta Cup clash.Scotland Head Coach Townsend said: “When you look through the squad this is the most competitive I’ve seen it in so many areas and that’s testament to the strength and depth we have.“We are able to call-up several new players into the squad such as Andy Christie, Kyle Rowe and Ben White.

The conclusion we’ve come it is that we are not going to get to the bottom of this till we talk to the people themselves, the kids who are getting involved in this and that’s where we are putting our effort at the moment.“We have secured the assistance of the local high school who are going to work with us on this, maybe through focus groups and with a little bit of talk perhaps we can find a solution.”Sergeant David Rourke said: “I don’t have all the answers and I’ll not pretend that I do. I wish I did, but I certainly believe what we need to do is engage the children and youths of the communities a lot better.“So what we’ve been trying to do is work in partnership with the high schools, the community council in Peebles and ious other organisations such as Youth Action Teams to address and ert the youth’s attentions from vandalisms such as what has happened in the play park to more productive activities around the region.“Generally when we have vandalism or any sort of crime we have feedback such as ‘where were the police’ or ‘what are the police doing to resolve this ’“The police cannot resolve this on their own.

So the opportunity hasn’t been there for young people to get out and be active in sport and potentially this is a reason behind anti-social behaviour.”And Dave Hodson from Tweeddale Youth Action added: “Through our youth clubs in Peebles and Innerleithen we continue to offer activities and opportunities for young people to have fun. We offer a place where young people can access support, advice and where we can signpost further services.“And really through volunteering opportunities we try and foster a sense of community spirit within our young people.“It’s important to say as well that the vast majority of our young people do play an active role in community le and are fantastic.”"},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-men-admit-jedburgh-high-street-clothing-shop-raid","story":"BACKGROUND reports have been ordered into two Borders men following a raid on a Borders clothing store.Thirty-year-old Andrew Clamp, of Hawick, pleaded guilty to a charge of theft by housebreaking at the premises of David Thomson  Son outfitters in High Street, Jedburgh, on November , .He also admitted the theft of a vehicle.Co-accused Scott Shearman, , pleaded guilty to the reset of shirts, jumpers, coats and jeans stolen from the shop which were found at his home in Howdenbank, Hawick, on November .He also admitted obstructing police and instructing his dog to attack a police officer.:Anti-vaccine group hack Scottish Borders Councils Twitter accountJedburgh Sherf Court was told that the dog bit Shearman on his arm instead.The court also heard that £, worth of clothing was stolen in the Jedburgh shop raid with £ worth of clothing recovered.Sentence was deferred until February  for the production of a Criminal Justice Social Work Report.Clamp also admitted assaulting two men with a metal pole on August  last year in Wellfield Road, Hawick.

Instead, it is based on the evidence-based, historical fact of Jesus# resurrection: #[God] has given us … hope# – a Bible term for #certainty# – #through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.# Because Jesus is alive, bodily, physically and in real time and space raised from death, we can have certainty even in these uncertain times in which we live."},{"url":null,"title":"covid support for businesses","story":"With the situation changing, businesses are encouraged to keep up-to-date with support available via the Find Business Support Scotland website.#Guidance for businesses and information about the UK and Scottish Governments# financial support package is available at findbusinesssupport.gov.scot coronavirus-advice,# explained Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for the economy and rural growth.He continued: #You can search and filter the funding options and guidance available to help your business during the pandemic.#We also recommend that you sign up to email updates from FindBusiness-SupportScotland to get the latest government funding announcements.#Our local Business Gateway advisers also remain available to help business owners across the region respond and adapt.#Argyll and Bute Council#s Business Gateway has added recovery support to its existing programme of business growth assistance, helping more businesses access timely expert advice and funding to support growth or recovery from the impact of the pandemic.The Argyll and Bute Business Gateway Local Growth Accelerator Programme now includes recovery grant funding of up to £,.This is aimed at existing small- and medium-sized enterprises which are aiming either to restore their annual turnover to pre-Covid levels within three years or aiming for modest growth.The programme also continues to offer growth support, via grants and expert help, with more than  businesses in the region assisted with grant funding and  with specialist advice.The programme must close in , so business owners looking for support are encouraged to register as soon as possible at www.argyll-bute.gov.uk bglgap.The Business Gateway Local Growth Accelerator Programme, worth a total of £,, is funded by Argyll and Bute Council and the European Regional Development Fund under the -

As there are currently  Conservative MPs sitting in Parliament,  Conservative MPs would need to submit letters to the  Committee to trigger an automatic leadership vote.: School letter about Boris Johnsons effortless superiority resurfacesThere is much inconsistency surrounding the reported number of MPs who have officially submitted a letter of no confidence. This morning, it’s been reported that  members of the  “Red Wall” elected Conservatives have handed in a letter. However, some Tory whips have reported that the number of total MPs to have submitted one is somewhere in the “twenties”.While inidual MPs are free to make it knownthey have submitted a letter, the  Committee keeps the actual number of MPs who have submitted one close to its chest.

Bestselling author, podcaster and speaker Emma Gannon is a self-confessed internet addict – but thinks we need get our humanity back and treat people better online, instead of constantly focusing on \"scaling\" or \"growing\" our followers.\"We used to compare ourselves with our neighbours. Now, we compare ourselves with everyone,\" Gannon observes. \"Its very confusing to work out what you want to do with your le.\"Gannon, who has a combined following of more than , on Twitter and Instagram, has written Disconnected: How To Stay Human In An Online World, which explores how people have become immersed in the digital world and how we need to remind ourselves of \"hope, humanity and heart\", reconnecting with our human selves, rather than our social media personas.It follows her first book, Ctrl Alt Delete: How I Grew Up Online, published in her late s, when she charted her internet experiences as a millennial born in the same year as the World Wide Web.Now , after further research and seeing whats happening to her and her friends and their relationship with the internet, she felt it was time for another book. \"Theres research now to back up theories that our memories are stronger when we are in the present moment. I look back now at huge gaps in my le when I cant really remember much because everything is through a screen, a photo, or through me packaging it up as an Instagram post.\"The digital world has become more toxic in the five years since her first book, she agrees. \"We used to think online and offline were two separate beings, when actually a lot of our behaviour on the internet is seeping into real le.\"Online toxicity can result in us becoming more anxious and aggressive to each other, she notes. \"Peoples fuses are shorter now. Weve also just spent two years online. We were just turning into people behind screens, which takes away our humanity.\"Many of her friends with big followings are leaving social media, she points out. \"The irony is that when you attract popularity for being yourself, you then attract the negative side, people not liking you, and then you water yourself down so you dont become yourself at all. The other side is that people are just becoming bored with it. We feasted on it and read the entire internet before bed, but I think we are just fatigued. Every time you swipe down to refresh your feed, its like a slot machine.\"Gannon admits that she was – and still is – addicted to the internet. \"It seems too strong a word – and maybe its not quite right because its not a substance that were consuming – but the withdrawal symptoms of needing to be by my phone, this idea of needing that hit of dopamine in the mornings, I could tell from a young age that I was more obsessed with the internet than a lot of my friends.\"Now, she says she has a great relationship with the online world, thanks in part to the mini prompts she has created for herself. \"The book is a mini daily prompt: Are you getting glazed-over eyes  Are you feeling physically anxious when you are scrolling  Ive become really aware of my physical self and how I need to take more breaks and the power of being compassionate to yourself.\"Gannon advises readers to \"work on [their] digital hygiene\" – a phrase she likens to \"clearing out your fridge of all the mouldy bits\" a kind of \"Marie Kondo technique of removing things that dont bring you joy\".\"Im following interiors accounts I like and people who inspire me,\" she says. \"Look through your list at who you are following and mute themnecessary. When you mute someone, they dont even know, so its about taking back control.\"\"Have a reason to pick up your phone,\" she suggests. \"Am I texting back a friend  Do I need to do a food shop  Do I need to send an email  Its an active thing, not a passive scroll, which is what a lot of people find themselves doing. We call it doomscrolling.\"Gannon recommends having separate personal and public Instagram accounts, one for her friends and family, the other for business. \"A lot of people my age have made the internet their job over the last decade, which has come with amazing positives. But the downside is, why would I want to share every aspect of my le with strangers  Its nice to have a little private space for you and your loved ones.\"\"Change your notications\" is another suggestion. \"I was getting pinged every time my cousin was texting me something I really didnt need to look at in that moment,\" she says. \"Prioritising what I need to look at and what I dont has changed everything for me. Im a big fan of aeroplane mode, which means no-one can get through and youre not having everything come in.\"Setting digital boundaries can also help. \"Put on an out of office, not just for email, but also in your WhatsApp where you can set an automated response,\" she suggests. \"Dont reply straight away. We live in this urgency [environment] in thatsomeone doesnt get a response in a day, they think youre dead. Its about setting that boundary.\"\"Make sure youre not getting every single notication,\" she adds. \"I dont get any now on social media. I just go on there when I want to to seeIve got any new messages.\"Gannon wants us to question our e-personalities. \"Are you doing something because you think it looks good, or because you feel good \" she asks. \"Sometimes people take a new job or go on a holiday because they think of the Instagram posts. One study by Expedia found that young people now book a holiday based on how Instagrammable it is. Take a moment to think how much it is impacting you.\"Not that she wants us to be too hard on ourselves. \"Sometimes I just want to sit in front of the TV and scroll on my phone for a bitIve had a rubbish day,\" she admits. \"Just be aware how much you are using it and slowly make your own changes.\"One idea is to reach out to people you havent spoken to in ages. \"They may be people who you might find you are having quite shallow relationships with online, sending each other emojis or likes every now and again. It doesnt have to be a hand-written letter, but make it a long message. Buy some notecards and tell them what you value about them.\"Gannon feels optimistic about the future. \"People are getting landlines back and starting to write letters again. We will soon realise what weve been missing and having more offline connection.\"Disconnected: How To Stay Human In An Online World by Emma Gannon is published by Hodder  Stoughton, £."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13394080.jpg?type=article-full","title":"souvenir-part-ii-honor-swinton-byrne-follows-tildas-footsteps","story":"Right now, she’s telling me about her favourite taste, one part of a Swinton Byrne sensory map of Scotland. The words come in a pell-mell, circling rush.“The taste is my mum’s … hear me out … cream, whisky and Marmite sauce for haggis, neeps and tatties.“My agent tried it once. Only once and I’ve never seen anyone look so … I can’t describe it … it was like fear. He absolutely hated it. He could not be near it ever again. I, on the other hand, absolutely adore it. It’s my favourite taste in the whole world.”If you could bottle Swinton Byrne’s bouncy, Tiggerish enthusiasm you could make a mint. I’m not sure about her mum’s cream, whisky and Marmite sauce, butTilda Swinton – yes, that Tilda Swinton – ever wanted to start a culinary side-line …As well as being the daughter of Tilda, Swinton Byrne is also the daughter of artist and writer John Byrne. She is also the twin sister of Xavier, a student and now a film star.Like mother, like daughter, then  Well, I don’t know about Swinton Byrne’s way with sauce, but on screen she is just as luminous a presence as her mum. You can decide for yourself with the release of The Souvenir: Part II, Joanna Hogg’s follow-up to The Souvenir , the director’s semi-autobiographical account of her own younger years, in which Swinton Byrne reprises her performance as wannabe director Julie. Indeed, there’s a moment near the end of the film where Swinton Byrne walks down a hall and at first glance you think you are looking at her mum.It should be said that Swinton Byrne’s mum is also in The Souvenir: Part II. Playing her daughters characters mum. Oh, and just to keep things intimate, Hogg is one of Swinton senior’s oldest friends.Honor Swinton Byrne in The Souvenir: Part II It’s October . The day before we talk Swinton Byrne turned . She spent her birthday travelling from Edinburgh, where she is a third-year psychology student, to London to walk the red carpet at the London Film Festival.There are worse ways to spend your birthday. Travelling first class certainly helped, she says.She is currently in a hotel in London doing press for her new film. Which is fine, but, as she points out, “it’s not Edinburgh.”Swinton Byrne has the same guileless quality in conversation as she does on the screen. She’s open, engaged and engaging. She’s less bothered today about her upcoming red-carpet moment than the classes she is skipping.“I’m missing a lot of lectures to be here. They don’t know where I am, but they won’t miss me.”When The Souvenir came out in  Swinton Byrne was a revelation. She had no acting experience. Indeed, she was cast just two weeks before shooting. She met Hogg in Berwick-upon-Tweed to seal the deal. But her performance was hugely lauded.It must have felt like a risk though. Why did she say yes  “I said yes because it felt right and that’s kind of it. I said yes because it felt like my next chapter. I had just left school. I was . She asked me two weeks before they started shooting  days, less than two weeks. It was a quick turnaround. They cut my hair in the bathroom literally a week before. I remember thinking, ‘It’s quite short.’“I was so flattered to be asked,\" she continues, \"and I was so excited to get to know Joanna on a deeper, much more personal level. It was just the next thing. It was meant to be.”The Souvenir: Part II is a beautully shot slice of arthouse cinema, that is by turns funnyand anxiety-inducing as we watch Julie try to make a movie.Richard Ayoade in The Souvenir: Part II While The Souvenir told the story of Julie’s troubled and troubling relationship with an older man played by Tom Burke, the sequel finds her moving forward. Eventually. “Oh Lordy, I was so happy to come back to Julie when she was growing in a positive direction,” Swinton Byrne suggests. “It might not seem that way. She’s going through the seven stages of grief so she is self-absorbed which is a very natural and I think a very healthy part of grieving. To really focus on yourself taking care of yourself, and she’s doing that.” Thankfully the distance between the two films wasn’t quite so traumatic for Swinton Byrne, but there was still a measure of le experience involved in the two-year gap between films.“In that time, I went to Africa. I was a volunteer teacher for a year in Namibia, so I grew some balls while I was away and grew up a wee bit. Then I came back, and I just had some more backbone.”And the experience of film-making was more rewarding second time around, Swinton Byrne says. She knew what was going on this time around and was more willing to speak up more.“It was a dferent process for me because Joanna … I can’t speak for her … but she included me a lot more in the second one, which was really enjoyable. But I’m really happy I wasn’t privy to that on the first one. I think it was good that I was so terried.”Swinton Byrne was  when she made the first film, and  when she made the second. How does she look back on the whole experience “Oh, my Lordy. It was the making ... I’m not going to say it … No, it was the making of me.“It was part of the whole tapestry, along with Africa, along with that two-year gap, along with finishing school, along with beginning university in making me the person I am right now speaking to you.“I really appreciate that the experience taught me to be more spontaneous, to be less afraid of unknown things and unknown situations, trusting and enjoying the experience, enjoying the bungee jumping.”All that and you got to work with your mum. “Hilarious. It was so much fun. I loved it. More of that please.”Did you learn anything about her through working with her that you didn’t know before “I learn more about my mum every day. She’s my best friend in the whole world. She’s my absolute soul mate, my mum.“I learned that she’s even more wonderful and skilled and encouraging of me doing whatever I want.”Honor Swinton Byrne and Tilda Swinton in The Souvenir: Part II Honor Swinton Byrne’s sensory map of Scotland, part two. Sound and vision:“The sound is eight o clock in the morning and doves coo-coo-cooing outside my window in autumn time around my birthday in October. That’s the sound.“The look  The look is Colonsay in the Hebrides. It’s ine. You’re on the three-and-a-half-hour ferry journey from Oban to Colonsay and you don’t see anything for hours and then you see this tiny little speck in the distance. That’s the look for me. And it’s always foggy and grey and then you see this little island. My parents and my brother go there. We try to go twice a year for Easter and the end of summer. We haven’t been for a while because of Covid, but it really is one of my favourite places.”Honor Swinton Byrne is talking about her childhood. “I’m from Nairn. Do you know where Nairn is  The arse-end of nowhere, proper little fishing village.”Her parents have since separated, but I imagine she and her brother had a very storied upbringing. Presumably Vogue were always turning up to do photoshoots. “That’s been part of my le for forever basically. I must have been four or five and I do remember people taking pictures at the end of the driveway. We don’t have any high security James Bond stuff. It’s a regular house in Nairn.”“People would come up to the door and ask to see my mum and I learnt very early on there were boundaries. It wasn’t appropriate to come to the house, so I like to think I’ve got a built-in bullshit detector.Which of her parents was the disciplinarian  “Oh, neither of them. They were the just the most gentle, loving parents. My brother was the army officer cracking the whip.”And when, Honor, did you first realise your parents were people too “That’s such a great question. Umm, I’m going to say it about my mum because she’s my hero. I always knew. I think when I saw her sleeping by herself. I must have been really small. She was doting on us hand and foot, we were breast-fed for a long time really. She had her hands full with the two of us. She didn’t get a chance to chill.“But I once saw her sleeping and she looked very small and very peaceful, just by herself just tucked up in bed.”Honor Swinton Byrne’s sensory map of Scotland, part . Touch and smell:“The touch  Oh, the touch is when it’s that dreich weather, that proper light, light rain. When it’s quite chilly, but it’s not freezing cold. It’s that wet air that I love. It’s my favourite. It makes your hair soaking wet when you go back but it’s not actually wet. It’s gorgeous.“And then the smell. The smell is the smell of wet dog. I have five spaniels, who are in Souvenir actually. My five little white spaniels and I love them very much. I’m very allergic to them.“I love the smell of wet dog, that’s a compliment, Scotland. They’re in the back of the car and we’ve just taken them to the beach because we’re by the sea and the smell of sand and seaweed and dead seal, like they’ve rolled in a dead seal, that earthy, earthy wet smell. I love it.“I kind of want a wee sausage dog in Edinburgh, but I’ll wait ’til I get my own place or find someone who will buy me a sausage dog. Like a wee loaf-of-bread dog I can carry.”Honor Swnton Byrne in The Souvenir: Part II We talk about her time in Namibia for a moment. She is delighted when I bring it up. “Oh, thank you for asking. My brother’s like, ‘Honor talks about Namibia all the time.’“I went with Project Trust, which is this amazing organisation. I taught English, Maths, PE, art and drama and I worked in a boarding school in the middle of nowhere.“I was there for  months. It was really intense and possibly the best thing I’ve ever done, the best use of my time.“It was funny coming back  months felt like nothing, though it didn’t feel like nothing when I was there. I bloody loved it so much.“It made me grow up a lot. There were a lot of near muggings and near car crashes and stabbings and stuff, but it put hair on my chest, it really did.”Sorry, near-stabbings  You not telling me you were nearly stabbed, are you “I was, yeah. My mum doesn’t know that. She’ll find out in this interview.“I think she can say now she was quite frightened, but I would never have known. She packed me up with lots of rock cake and stuff that wouldn’t go off. She was so supportive. I didn’t speak to my parents much when I was there. Just to check in. ‘Yeah, still alive, got all my limbs, I haven’t got malaria yet.’“It was hardcore, but it was sooooo awesome …I hate being one of those workers [who go], ‘Yeah, went on a gap year.’”This is one of the things to like about Honor Swinton Byrne. She thinks she should be a bit cooler, but she just can’t hide her enthusiasm for le.When we speak, she’s just started her third-year psychology course at Edinburgh University.“I’m doing forensics at the moment I love it so much. I’m a proper gore fiend. I want to do my dissertation on necrophilia.”Very Goth, Honor. “I like all the really dark side of psychology. Nothing really phases me in terms of people. I say that. Lots of things phase me, but I’m very, very intrigued.”So, I say at the end of our time, where are you now  What are you now  A student  An actor “I want to do lots of dferent things. I want to stay on at uni and possibly do a masters and a PHD and do some volunteering in prisons.But I really want to continue acting. I really enjoy it. It makes me so happy. I connect the two, the psychology and the acting. I enjoy acting because it’s putting myself in someone ’s shoes. It’s all about empathy to me and that’s so cheesy and so cliched but it really is.“I’d quite like to do a dferent role. I’d like to be a Bond villain or something, play a psychopath. That’s what I’m into. We’ll seeanyone sees me as a cyborg mastermind.”Maybe there’s a role in the next reboot of Terminator  “See you then.”All being well, Honor Swinton Byrne will be back. And she can probably bring her own catchphrase with her.

Only % Agreed.The plan unveiled by Transport Scotland to replace ferries with fixed links comes  years after the opening of the Skye bridge was mired in controversy.For decades islanders had called for a road bridge from the mainland as growing visitor numbers put a strain on the ferry that ran between Kyle of Lochalsh and Kyleakin.But the cost of the bridge’s tolls sparked outrage. Car drivers were charged up to £. each way, compared to p on the Forth Road Bridge. Protesters claimed this made the Skye crossing the most expensive road toll in Europe.Net zero, energy and transport secretary Michael Matheson has unveiled a plan that could see another crossing to Mull, which has been hit with ferry disruption. A bridge from Oban to the nearest community on Mull would be around ten miles long while a link between Fishnish on Mull and Lochaline in the Morvern area of Highland, across the sound of Mull would cover just three miles.Transport Scotland has also talks of a plan of a fixed link between North and South Uist and Lewis and Harris.Another bridge or tunnel could link Barra and the Uists.But the move has come despite the views expressed in the poll.Joe Reade, the chairman of the Mull and Iona Ferry Committee said: \"It would seem that people value their island identity.\"No-one on Mull has been publicly asking for a fixed link. We have been asking simply for more reliable and more efficient ferries, for years. Before we start thinking about tunnels under the sea, we need to fix the very urgent and fundamental problems with the ferry service.\"What they want is a reliable ferry service, one that is dependable in typical winter weather, and has space for everyone who wants to use it in the summer. These are the basic expectations of a leline ferry service, but at the moment they are not being met.\"Thinking big thoughts about the future is always healthy. We should never assume that things will always be done the way they have in the past. It is healthy to have some ambitious thinking in Transport Scotland.\"Ironically however, that is one of the major cultural and institutional problems with the current state ferry establishment – change happens at glacial pace and decisions often seem to be shaped by dogma and vested interests rather than asking what would actually deliver the best service to islanders at least cost.\"So rather than distracting us with grandiose plans for  years hence, what is really needed is a two - five year plan to fix the chronically dysal and expensive ferry system.\"It comes after Transport Scotland bought a new ferry for from MR Norled, the Norwegian shipping company, to help support the ageing leline ferry fleet this year.The vessel was on offer for just £.m. A £m deal to capture the ferry includes the price of modications.The seven-year-old vessel which carries  passengers and  cars has been earmarked for the Oban to Craignure on Mull route in the network run by Scottish Government-controlled ferry operator CalMac.It comes as the delivery of new leline island ferries MV Glen Sannox and Hull , which were due online in the first half of , are over five years late, with costs doubling in total to over £m.According to a transport review analysis the moves for bridges or tunnels have come as current ferry routes on the Sound of Harris, Sound of Barra and between Craignure on Mull and Oban face a \"number of issues and challenges\".It says: \"Replacing ferry services with fixed links bridges or tunnel can improve reliability, connectivity, capacity and crossing times.\"A Sound of Harris fixed link would improve connectivity between the Uists and Lewis Harris while a Sound of Barra fixed link would improve connectivity between Barra and the Uists.\"The provision of these fixed links would allow for the reconfiguration of transport provision between the Outer Hebrides and the mainland.\"The provision of a fixed link between Mull and the Scottish mainland would allow for the reconfiguration of transport provision between the island and the mainland.\"Further work is now to be undertaken on business cases to better understand the benefits, costs and challenges associated with these options.The analysis said the studies would \"consider the feasibility of replacing existing fery services\" currently delivered by CalMac as part of the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Servicescontract.The analysis added: \"These studies would also ascertain the potential savings associated with the public sector subsidies required to operate the ferry services and involve input from communities that may potentially be affected.\"But Mr Reade said people feel \"completely ignored\" when calls are made for the need for changes to improve the ferry service.\"The house is burning down and we are shouting urgently for someone to do something, and the response from Edinburgh is look at this shiny fire engine that we’ll have in  years.\"It’s the kind of top-down approach to the islands we are getting more fed up with. We’re being told what the solutions are, and rarely asked about our problems.\"I would also point out that a tunnel to Mull is by no means an easy task, and a glance at the map will tell you this.\"It is thought the most practical place to install a fixed link would be in the three miles between Fishnish on Mull and Lochaline in the Morvern area of Highland, across the sound of Mull.But Mr Read said there would still be a strong need to retain a ferry to Oban because it is Mulls closest mainland town and a local service centre, where ochildren go to school and the shortest route to central Scotland.\"A bridge to Morvern would take us to one of the most isolated mainland peninsulas, with no signicant town until Fort William after about another one-and-a-half hours drive on predominantly single-track roads,\" said Mr Reade.\"So it is dficult to imagine that the business case for a tunnel to Morvern would stack up, since there would be very few balancing cost savings in reduced ferry operations.\"The alternative tunnel – to Oban – would need to be about eight miles long and would make it the longest road tunnel in the UK by quite some margin. It is dficult to imagine that would be justied for an island of , people who at the moment show little desire for one.\"A Transport Scotland spokesman: “The draft recommendations are currently out for consultation and we would encourage island communities to respond, having already heard from them about the importance of reliable links to the Scottish mainland.\"The investigation of potential fixed links at Sounds of Harris and Barra, and between Mull and the mainland is one of  recommendations now being consulted on.  The recommendation identies that the next step would be further business case work, to better understand the socioeconomic benefits, costs and challenges associated with these options.  We will of course include the communities that may be affected by these proposals in that work.  Strategic Transport Projects Review also recommends ferry vessel renewal and replacement, progressive decarbonisation of these and the associated investment in port infrastructure.“Further work is planned within the Islands Connectivity Plan, which will replace the current Ferries Plan from January , supporting the delivery of NTSR priorities and the National Islands Plan.  Alongside further consideration of the long-term investment programme for new ferries and development at ports the Plan will undertake a ferry fares policy review alongside our wider Fair Fares review.  Following engagement and consultation in , the aim is to publish a draft Plan for consultation by the end of the year.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : pmOrkney#s female rugby side, the Orkney Dragons, were resounding winners against Fraserburgh this afternoon.

These schemes include the Albano Machado and Rio dos Índios projects and the Tambopata-Bahuaja bioersity reserve in Peru.However, Loganair recognises the importance of supporting local communities on their own path to carbon zero, which is facilitated via the GreenSkies Community fund.The fund will be released in three instalments of £,, with applicants able to access a maximum grant of £, per project. The application deadline for the first instalment is st January, .The initiative is open to communities and will help to establish renewable energy projects such as small-scale wind systems, solar , small-scale hydro power, and air source heat pumps. It is not available for funding research or feasibility studies.Jonathan Hinkles, CEO, Loganair, said: “We’ve made our position clear. The transport industry as a whole has a duty to address and reduce emissions from every form of travel, and it’s our responsibility as the UK’s largest regional airline to lead the way.“Our GreenSkies Community Fund will support local renewables projects that not only tackle carbon emissions but also benefit communities by providing power that reduces energy bills.

The cost of the bid was £million.Simon Hodge, chief executive of Crown Estate Scotland, said: #Today’s results are a fantastic vote of confidence in Scotland’s ability to transform our energy sector. Just a couple of months after hosting COP, we’ve now taken a major step towards powering our future economy with renewable electricity.“In addition to the environmental benefits, this also represents a major investment in the Scottish economy, with around £m being delivered straight into the public finances and billions of pounds worth of supply chain commitments.#The iety and scale of the projects that will progress onto the next stages shows both the remarkable progress of the offshore wind sector, and a clear sign that Scotland is set to be a major hub for the further development of this technology in the years to come.#More on this story in this week#s The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642067512749.jpg--take_part_in_this_year_s_big_garden_birdwatch.jpg?1642067512000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220113newstake part in this year s big garden birdwatch","story":"Keep your eyes wide open, get the kettle on and grab your binoculars as RSPB NI encourage you to join in on the charity’s Big Garden Birdwatch this month.

Even a knock or a bump could accelerate the transformation of tissue to bone.Lucy explained that when she and her sister were born their toes were shaped like bunions, one of the “tell tale signs” of FOP.However, at the time little was known about the condition, of which there is no definitive treatment or cure available, and the twins were not diagnosed until aged eight.Zoe explained: “When I was five I fell and broke my arm and it never really healed properly. When we were diagnosed with FOP no-one knew much about it because it was so rare.“At the time it was much harder for our parents as they really took the brunt of it because we were children.“But even now it can still be very hard because we are the only people with FOP in Northern Ireland.”Lucy added: “Back when we were children there was hardly any information about FOP but one person we were able to speak to was Fred Kaplan in Philadelphia.“He was the only person who knew much about it and even nowanything goes wrong we can send him an email.“He dedicates a lot of his time to research into FOP and we are very fortunate to have him.”The sisters, who attended Slemish College, described what it was like growing up in Ballymena with FOP.Zoe said: “We are so lucky to have each other but going to school was dficult in the sense that everyone was able bodied and we weren’t.“We went to Slemish which was such a great college, however, I was quite clumsy so I had to use a wheelchair and it was a bit harder for me because I couldn’t go outside at break times and join my friends.”When Lucy was  she tripped and hurt the back of her neck and the resulting bone growth left her unable to raise her arms above her head. In the same year Zoe broke her leg and was left unable to straighten it.Lucy explained that just recently she experienced a flare-up resulting in her jaw locking.She explained: “Over the last six months I have had a couple of flare-ups and it has been really dficult.“I had swelling under my chin and I couldn’t open my mouth so I had to have liquids.“I just kept telling myself that it won’t last and will get better which it did and I am thankful for that because there are people with FOP whose jaws have locked permanently.”Both Lucy and Zoe share a positive outlook on le which comes from practicing gratitude and not worrying about things outside of their control. Zoe who has a keen interest in interior design works for Ivy and Gold and lives in Cloughmills with her husband Mike whilst Lucy, a content creator, lives in Ballymena with her husband Michael.Zoe said: “I couldn’t get a job anywhere. I knew what I was able to do but no-one would take a chance on me. When I got a job with Ivy and Gold I was so grateful.” For Lucy and Zoe the pandemic has been particularly dficult as they are unable to get the vaccine due to their condition.Zoe said: We are normally together all the time but during lockdown we were from dferent households so we couldnt see each other.Butyou needed to be looked after and needed help you were allowed to go to someone s house so I went to my parents. It was hard for me to be on my own.Neither of us can get the vaccine because we cant have anything injected into our muscles so we have to be very careful.The sisters dont know what the future holds for them but they are determined to “live for the now”.Zoe said: “You cant think too far ahead because we dont know what the future holds for us with FOP.“We think it is best to live for the now becauseyou plan ahead too much you are easily disappointed.”Lucy and Zoe are keen to raise awareness of FOP through their social media channels and particularly want to highlight what signs to look out for.Lucy said: A baby with FOP will have toes that look like bunions and some children will have a joint missing in their thumb.“Spotting these first indicators allows parents to find out sooner rather than later whether or not their child has FOP.A petition to dedicate funding into research for the condition was debated in parliament at the end of last year. Lucy said: “Ian Paisley spoke on behalf of us and did such a good job. He fought our corner and we were very appreciative and hopefully it will go through to the next stage.“At the minute FOP families and friends fundraise but it is extremely hard as there are not that many of us.”Last year Zoes husband Mike and his work colleagues from Spar, Doury Road climbed Slemish and raised pound for FOP Friends.They are also planning to organise more fundraising events for the charity which is the only one in the UK dedicated to supporting people living with FOP and their families.The charity actively fundraises to support research into a treatment and a cure for FOP and more information can be found on their website www.fopfriendsYou can also find out more about Lucy and Zoe by following their Instagram handles which are Lucy Fretwell: allthingsbeautullymade and Zoe Buxton: alittlebitofle "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642778651871.jpg--covid_19___fri_21st_january_figures.jpg?1642778651000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220121newscovid 19 fri 21st january figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

Credit: Niall CarsonLisa SmythTwitterJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailIt is one month since the Executive introduced a raft of restrictions aimed at reducing the spread of Omicron.Put in place just before Christmas and amid warnings that the health service could be overwhelmed by a surge in seriously ill patients, it now appears the iant is up to % less severe than Delta.Read MorePublic split over Executive plan to scrap coronavirus restrictionsGivan ready to abandon Covid passport schemeother Executive parties agreeIn fact, in a briefing paper presented to the Executive this week, ministers were told that while hospital admissions and Covid bed occupancy increased in the last week, they have peaked and started to fall slowly in the last few days.The document went on to explain the numbers of patients requiring supplementary oxygen, ICU occupancy and hospital deaths remained “relatively steady” and Covid- patients in critical care units were “still predominantly a result of Delta infection”.It is likely case numbers are going to rise in the coming weeks as a result of the virus running rampant through schools.This will eventually work its way into older age groups and is likely to result in more people requiring hospital treatment, but the official position is one of cautious optimism.And that’s why, as quickly as they were put in place, measures that business leaders and a public fed with up with two years of disruption to their lives, have been lted.Gone are the rule of six in pubs and restaurants and the requirement for table service in licensed premises has been lted, while the self-isolation period for positive cases has been dropped to five days.Meanwhile, from noon on Wednesday, further rules are to be relaxed, including dropping the use of Covid certicates at pubs, restaurants and cinemas, the reopening of nightclubs and the resumption of dancing and indoor standing events.And the First Minister has also indicated all remaining restrictions, such as legal requirements on face masks and regular lateral flow testing, could be scrapped next month.There does appear to be a growing sense that the worst may be over for Northern Ireland.Indeed, the World Health Organisation’s Covid chief has suggested the end of the pandemic is in sight for Britain.And Professor Devi Sridhar, Professor and Chair of Global Public Health at Edinburgh University, has also provided a chink of light.Writing in thethis week, she said: “Delaying and preventing infection as much as possible through this pandemic was a worthwhile strategy.“In early , there were few treatments, limited testing and no vaccines.“The cost of those lockdowns were big, but the effort to buy time paid off. In that time, sciences has transformed Covid from a deadly virus to a much less serious, nasty disease — one that is manageable at home, for the vast majority of those vaccinated.“It has, largely, defanged, it.”Of course, as with everything in science, this isn’t a position shared by everyone.Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist and statistical geneticist, has expressed alarm at the rolling back of restrictions. It comes amid an estimated , new cases of Covid- in Northern Ireland every day and a daily tally of more than , positive cases across the UK.“I certainly don’t think we are approaching the tail of the pandemic,” she said.“I have seen no evidence to indicate that and when you are recording more than , cases a day, to say the pandemic is over, it’s nonsense.“I can’t think of any country in the world that is lting restrictions when it’s recording more than , cases a day.”However, Northern Ireland’s chief scientic adviser, Professor Ian Young, has said he is “cautiously optimistic” about the future.“It is the World Health Organization that makes the call on whether it is a pandemic,” he explained.“We may move to a position where the virus becomes part of the background here, but it is still causing big problems in other countries.“I don’t think we’re near the end of the pandemic yet but I think in terms of the way the virus is behaving in this country, I think that we’re moving to a position where it will be endemic.“I think I am delighted as everyone  is that we’re in a position to be able to relax some of the restrictions, no-one wants to see those in place any longer than required.“I believe the Executive has made a very reasonable decision to take the brakes off but not throw everything out the window, and waiting to see how things go over the next three weeks before making the next round of decisions.”So,the statistics continue to move in the right direction and Northern Ireland comes out from under the shadow of Omicron without suffering the catastrophe threatened before Christmas, will le as we knew it before Covid- resume A major question for the Executive will be whether they keep in place the current testing and contact tracing infrastructure once the threat of Omicron has passed.Another consideration — how long will the Department of Health continue to update its daily Covid- dashboard with statistics on daily cases, hospitalisations and deaths Most experts now agree the figures cannot be relied upon given the current testing regime, so how much do we actually learn from the daily update Also, will Northern Ireland remain in crisis mode evenit regards Covid- as endemic while other countries around the world continue to struggle At what stage will our hospitals be able to resume elective surgery to any degree that it stops the spiralling waiting lists And what threat is posed by another iant It is true that the vaccines are playing a major role in keeping people safe — but we cannot exclude the possibility of a vaccine resistant iant that results in serious illness.Professor Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “It could happen next month or it could happen in  years. “As we have seen throughout the pandemic, it’s impossible to predict what is going to happen.”Prof Young has also said he cannot rule out the possibility, although he stressed “it would be unlucky”.Assuming that we are now finally moving beyond the almost permanent crisis state in which we have existed for almost two years, what next It is naïve — and dare I say it somewhat selfish— to think we are going toto a world without some form of public health measures once the worst of Omicron has passed.While for the majority of people, Covid- will be a self-limiting illness that can be treated at home, there will be those who are still clinically extremely vulnerable. Even with the vaccines and advances in treatments, the virus will still claim lives.What measures will the public accept to ensure the tens of thousands of people regarded as extremely vulnerable to the virus don’t have to remain locked away indefinitely In herarticle, Prof Sridhar stressed evenCovid- is endemic, “that doesn’t mean harmless”.She continued: “Endemic means that we accept a circulation of a disease because elimination or eradication is perceived as too dficult.“Malaria, dengue and measles are endemic in certain parts of the world even though they are all serious diseases.“Malaria was endemic in the United States until the government decided to eliminate it.“This is part of a larger question about how much we continue to alter what ‘normal’ social relations are, given the circulation of Sars-CoV-.“Humans are social, we need to hug, dance, sing and recognise each other’s faces and smiles. A sense of community and connection are vital to wellbeing too.“Public health is not about one disease, it is broadly about well-being, which includes mental health and being able to pay the rent, feed your family, stay warm through winter and have a meaningful role in society.”To do this, we need to develop better ways of living alongside Covid-.For Dr Ultan Power, professor of molecular virology at Queen’s University in Belfast, this includes more research to establish levels of immunity and theof time people remain infectious.This would, he said, allow policy makers to make better and more informed decisions over the likes of self-isolation.“If we could develop a rapid test that predicts how long someone is infectious, not whether they are still positive, that would be very helpful,” he explained.Meanwhile, experts such as Dr Gurdasani and Dr Gabriel Scally, visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol, are clear that measures such as air filtration systems in schools will protect children across Northern Ireland from all airborne disease.The Education Minister has so far resisted calls for their implementation, citing insufficient evidence to warrant the £m bill.However, the hope is that our politicians and officials will take steps now to keep us safe in the future.If the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that a novel virus, capable of killing millions of people around the world is not just a Hollywood concept but can become a reality within a matter of months.Related topicsThe Executive OfficeDelta iantDepartment of HealthDepartment of EducationMore On The Executive Office PremiumViewpointOpinionOpinion poll a mixed bag for the DUPGivan ready to abandon Covid passport schemeother Executive parties agreeDisaster for DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson as Sinn Fein extends lead to eight points PremiumConsiderable unionist support for DUP stance on scrapping Protocol PremiumViewpointOpinionFreedom comes at a price for everyoneMost ReadDead man ‘propped up by two other men in attempt to collect pension at Carlow post office’Luxury million-pound Co Down home with breath-taking views of Belfast LoughDisaster for DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson as Sinn Fein extends lead to eight pointsPSNI confirm appointment of four new senior roles in forceSeven suspected handguns located following PSNI east Belfast searchTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty Play‘Time to be ourselves again’ – Taoiseach announces end to Covid- restrictionsLatest CoronavirusGame Changer Awards to honour and celebrate Northern Ireland’s inspirational sportswomenGivan ready to abandon Covid passport schemeother Executive parties agreeFirst Minister Paul Givan urges NI Covid passport to be ‘withdrawn in all settings’Public split over Executive plan to scrap coronavirus restrictionsMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageLatestThousands protest across Europe at vaccine passportsJonjo Shelvey fires Newcastle to second win of the season to boost survival bidMarcus Rashford strikes in stoppage time as Man Utd snatch victory over West HamDon’t approach laboratory monkey missing after crash, residents toldJabs and kebabs: Brothers offer Covid vaccines at grill after father’s illness,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Andrew MaddenTwitterEmailJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailBelfast city councillors have voted not to fly the Union flag at City Hall next month to mark embattled Prince Andrews birthday.It comes amid the fallout from the duke#s civil sex assault case, after a judge ruled earlier this month that Virginia Giuffre#s lawsuit against him should proceed.Ms Giuffre alleges Prince Andrew sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager.Read MoreRelief in Portrush as duke stripped of title at famous golf club amid sex caseUnder current rules, the Union flag is flown at Belfast City Hall on a number of designated days each year, set by the UK Government#s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport .Alliance councillor Nuala McAllister said her party have contacted DCMS proposing to remove Prince Andrew’s birthday from the designated list – instead proposing July  is added to mark the Battle of the Somme in its place.The flag was due to be flown on the building on February , the duke#s nd birthday, however SDLP councillor Donal Lyons proposed, given the controversy, that this should not go ahead.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Speaking during a meeting of Belfast City Council#s Strategic Policy and Resources Committee on Friday morning, Mr Lyons said the issue of flags in Belfast has been contentious in the past, however his proposals were not in this vein and not about issues relating to national identity, rather it was a question of what is right and what is wrong.Everyone, of course, is entitled to due process - but having a flag flown in your honour is not an entitlement, it#s a privilege, he said.We#ve seen schools, other councils, and even the Royal Family take steps to distance themselves from this situation. I#m not going to comment on the allegations facing Prince Andrew, they are well documented and widely known, but what I will say is how you make your argument reflects on your character.In a sexual assault case, to cast up ideas of gold-digging or paydays being sought, to suggest photographic evidence has been doctored, or to throw up terms like # memory# and seek to bring in health experts to claim constitutional protection and to seek to portray a victim as some sort of perpetrator - it#s nothing short of disgraceful and sends an appalling message to women and girls everywhere.I propose that we don#t proceed with the flying of the flag on the th of February, and in lieu of that discussions should take place among party group leaders to find a more less disagreeable occasion.DUP council group leader Brian Kingston, on the other hand, said his party would be opposing the proposal.The position of the DUP councillors is that we should abide by our policy to abide by the days designated by the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport at Westminster,” he said.We are certainly not blind to the allegations of gross misconduct against Prince Andrew and we share in the deep concern about these allegations, but we should await the outcome of the trial.The proposals were passed by a vote, with only the DUP members of the committee voting against.It comes after the Queen stripped the duke of his royal patronages, which saw him lose his honorary titles at Royal Portrush, Royal Belfast and Royal County Down golf clubs.Prince Andrew visited Royal Portrush when it hosted The Open back in  and later ed to the course to play a round later that year. A long-standing patron of the club, he opened its new clubhouse in .Virginia Giuffre claims she was trafficked by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was -years-old and a minor under United States law.The duke has repeatedly denied the allegations.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilSDLPMore On Belfast City CouncilHundreds back call to restore Belfast’s Wilmont House to former gloryBelfast City Council voices opposition to closure of Regina Coeli Women#s HostelRegister for animal cruelty offenders is a step closer, says Poots PremiumJust one Orange lodge awarded grant from £m heritage fund PremiumViewpointOpinionIt’s worth travelling along green routeMost ReadDead man ‘propped up by two other men in attempt to collect pension at Carlow post office’Luxury million-pound Co Down home with breath-taking views of Belfast LoughDisaster for DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson as Sinn Fein extends lead to eight pointsPSNI confirm appointment of four new senior roles in forceSeven suspected handguns located following PSNI east Belfast searchTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty PlayStranded dog rescued with sausage dangled from droneLatest Northern IrelandMark Hall: PSNI believe west Belfast man’s killers arrived in silver car with taxi signProtesters urge Ulster Rugby to sever ties with sponsor KingspanMatthew Tipton: I won’t spend Portadown’s £k Lee Bonis windfall for sake of itStephen CraiganOpinionPlayers now seeing Irish League in all new lightBelfast Giants cannot afford to dwell on our winning run coming to and end, warns Adam KeefeLatestLast-gasp Marcus Rashford goal lts Man Utd as Aston Villa add to Everton woesMark Hall: PSNI believe west Belfast man’s killers arrived in silver car with taxi signBanners protesting against Boris Johnson flown over Premier League gamesRuben Neves nets Wolves winner in match dogged by drone and delays at BrentfordIan Alexander Jr, only child of award-winning actor Regina King, dies aged ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is understandable that there are concerns around receiving the vaccine.

have opted to commit pound, on a major upgrade of the existing complex which will include a reconfiguration of the internal floorspace in a bid to increase the buildingrsquos usage.Politicians say they are keen to work in partnership with council officials and the Ballynahinch Community Collective to improve sports and community provision in the town to meet the needs of a wide range of people.Elected representatives say Ballynahinch needs to be at the heart of planned investment in future leisure provision across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Politicians are keen to ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out when it comes to leisure provision investment, given the money that has already spent in other towns across the council area.They believe that the good working relationship that exists between elected representatives across the Rowallane area can ensure that Ballynahinch does not miss out on future funding opportunitiesand that the needs of the townrsquos community are met, particularly when it comes to modern leisure, sports and community provision.Politicians want Ballynahinch to be included in any future strategy when it comes to leisure activities and provision, warning that the town cannot afford be left behind.They say the current community centre requires a much-needed upgrade with the current proposal a major step in the right direction.Elected representatives say that given the local council spend on major schemes in other parts of the district, the ratepayers of Ballynahinch deserve nothing less than an upgrade community

All statutory consultees bar one have now given the proposal their approval, with discussions with the final consultee in progress.Association officials say the planning application covers only the paths, pond, fencing and information  associated with the field close to the community centre.ldquoMany hours have been put in completing the application to the Heritage Fund which was submitted at the end of November with a decision due in March, Saintfield News confirms, explaining thatthe bid is successful, it will be for the development phase of the project.ldquoThis will probably take one year and will include detailed measurements of the scheduled monument buildings, work plans, costings for stabilising these and obtaining scheduled monument consent and planning approval for these works.ldquoAt the end of this development phase a further application to the Heritage Fund would be made for the delivery phase of the project. ldquoThe association says thatthis was successful and all went well, the park and windmill would be opened to the public in the spring of .However,the Heritage Fund application is unsuccessful, the association will proceed with the proposal, but the work would exclude the scheduled monument area.ldquoThis would be fenced off as unsafe and left as is, reports Saintfield News. ldquoCompetition for Heritage Fund grants is very competitive and many other projects in Northern Ireland will be applying. It will be a great achievementwe are successful.ldquoThis is probably the only source of funding that can preserve the windmill and the other two buildings of the scheduled monument for future generations. Without this funding, the buildings will continue their slow decline and will eventually collapse.Meanwhile, the man who is supporting the community park proposal visited Saintfield recently.Mr Moffett has already made a substantial donation to the association to enable it to purchase the Windmill Field.During his visit, Mr Moffett had an opportunity to walk around the field and visualise how the proposed community park would surround the ancient windmill and caretakerrsquos home that is part of Saintfieldrsquos history. He also met a number of residents at the community centre before visiting Rowallane Garden for a guided tour.Mr Moffett concluded the first day of his visit with a visit to the Belfast Road community centre to view the new facility and was impressed at the potential of fitting out the remaining empty buildings which would include a heritage area to complement the planned windmill park.Mr Moffett, who also played a round of golf at Royal County Down and visited the Mournes, said the beauty of Co Down, with its unique visitor sites and the central location of Saintfield, reinforced in his mind the importance of the windmill park project and the heritage centre.The third and final day of his visit was spent at a local shop exploring the location of his familyrsquos th century farm in Leggygowan.Mr Moffett said: ldquoExploring my family history was a wonderful way to end my visit to Saintfield. I look forward to ing soon and continuing to work on our shared interest in completing the windmill park project and heritage centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19January2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Speed sign reinstated in Saintfield in bid to halt speeding drivers  ","story":"WORK has started to reinstate an electronic speed indicator sign at the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield.The sign mdash one of a number erected across the district by the arearsquos Policing and Community Partnership mdash was removed last year after concerns were expressed about its original location at the busy road.Designed to put the brakes on speeders, the signs have proved effective in a number of locations with plans to install more of them over the coming months.The reinstatement of the Saintfield sign has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen, who said that it will make drivers more aware of their speed at this busy road.A decision to relocate the Saintfield sign was agreed by a sub-committee of the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.Cllr Owen said she was delighted that the speed sign was being erected as it will remind drivers of their speed as they approach the built-up town centre area.Cllr Owen also thanked residents who helped her lobby for the reinstatement of the speed indicator sign following its removal.The Ballynahinch Road is one of the districtrsquos speeding hot spots with a number of high speeds recorded by the previous speed indicator sign located in a mph zone. It was revealed last May that one driver was clocked travelling at an incredible mph in the mph zone in Saintfield at am.Figures released by the PCSP over the past year have revealed that speeding in built-up areas across the district continues to be a major problem.In addition to the Ballynahinch Road in Saintfield, other speeding hot spots include the Strangford Road in Downpatrick and South Promenade in Newcastle.The Dundrum Road in Clough is a new entry on the list following the installation of an electronic speeding device on the approach to the village, while the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass is another new entry on the speeding hot-spot list.The highest speed recorded in the mph zone in Clough was mph at am, with the highest speed at the Strangford Road mdash where a mph limit is in place mdash was mph. This offence was detected around am.Since the speeds recorded by the electronic devices have been made public, politicians have expressed their shock at the behaviour of those who continue to break the law and have appealed to them to slow down.Erected as part of a major offensive on speeding drivers at a number of well known speeding hot spots, the speed indicator devices are being hailed a success as speeds in most areas where they are located are reducing.However, concern remains about the behaviour of some drivers continuing to show a blatant disregard for mph and mph speed limits in place.Recent figures published by the PCSP revealed that the highest number of speeders in Castlewellan and Killyleagh were detected around am and pm respectively, with those who hit high speeds in Ardglass detected at pm.While Clough recorded the highest speed, a detailed examination of the figures reveals that five drivers went through the mph in the village at mph, with % of all drivers travelling in excess of the speed limit.In Downpatrick,  drivers were detected at over mph in the mph zone, with one driver clocked at mph in the mph zone at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan. The highest speed recorded at the mph zone at the Downpatrick Road in Ardglass was mph.Policing and Community Safety Partnership officials say that figures recorded across the districtrsquos speed indicator signs for the most recent three-month period shows an overall speed reduction of around six percent.The number of drivers clocked at over mph across the  speed indicator signs spread across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area was almost , while the average number of speeding violations over mph was %.

It has been highly infectious but has had minor health impacts.This is a time to celebrate the success of the vaccine programme, above all in the United Kingdom — a country of which we are lucky to be a part given that is a global scientic leader and played a key role in developing the medications.It is also a time to recognise the way in which the great bulk of people have, cheerfully enough, adapted to the new considerate ways of living in a pandemic.This experience will almost certainly help us to respond much more quickly to any future viral outbreak. Many people, for example, will want to continue to wear masks even when they cease to be mandatory.It might yet be that there is fresh, more dangerous outbreak of Covid. But we can no longer put le on hold due to that possibility.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The party could have stalled on agreeing to such a formationit didn’t have a result on the Irish Sea border.ButSir Jeffrey will be without a Westminster seat then he will be known to be in the same situation Arlene Foster found herself after  – effectively jobless unless Stormont is operating as normal.Thus the u-turn by Boris Johnson this week leaves the DUP with badly reduced options. The party also looks isolated amid the joint six-party approach to Mr Johnson against the double jobbing plan.This must all be a joy for Sinn Fein. On one issue or another they have found themselves joined by almost all of the parties as signatories in petitions to power against ious topics of the day.They enjoyed multi-party photo opportunities for their demand for an Irish language act, yet I never recall a single multi-party approach to London or Dublin calling on the two governments to ensure that SF’s collapse of Stormont in  did not get political reward .Sinn Fein enjoyed four-party approaches to the EU both before the NI Protocol was agreed, and after .On double jobbing it finds itself alongside the Ulster Unionist Party in its joint approach to Downing St. And there was a notable moment last year when Paul Givan observed that SF was, like the other parties, opposed to the government legacy plan, and he said the party could influence such debates by taking its Westminster seats. This gave a sense of common purpose, which was unfortunate given that the republican role in the Troubles is at the core of unionist dislike of SF. You might expect that on legacy, above all issues, unionists would express contempt for the republican stance on an amnesty, and emphasise that their rejection of the proposed stay on prosecutions is for reasons opposite to those of SF.But whatever mis-steps unionists make, it is only fair to note that they get little consistent, heavyweight support at Westminster.Every so often this paper is alerted to a sympathetic question that a pro unionist peer has asked in the Lords, soliciting a seemingly unionist answer from a minister. But this is no match for Tory MPs such as Julian Smith and Simon Hoare, the influential NI Affairs Committee chair, who speak up as soon as Ireland is upset about something. Hoare, an MP who is swt to dismiss unionist concerns , this week led the Commons chorus against the double jobbing move. The government soon buckled to his arguments.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor• Ben Lowry: My memory of  Meat Loaf concert in Belfast• Ben Lowry January : Double jobbing change seems to be bid by London to shore up the DUP• Owen Polley: Flip-flopping prime minister can’t be relied on to sort out the Northern Ireland Protocol"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland is lucky to have kenneth branagh as an ambassador ","story":"Work starts on £m hotel plan at former military base   Murder of Sir Norman Stronge recalled on anniversary of ‘barbarous’ IRA attackNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsOpinionNorthern Ireland is lucky to have Kenneth Branagh as an ambassadorNews Letter editorial of Saturday January  :By EditorialSaturday, nd January , : amUpdated Saturday, nd January , : am  \"       \"  News Letter editorialFrom Stephen Boyd to Liam Neeson, some Northern Ireland have found fame in Hollywood.Ken Branagh is one of the most successful of them all.

I just mentioned I was fond of a cream bun on air one day and it just stuck.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I could have the weight of the world on my shoulders before my show - I’m not always chirpy, chirpy, chirpy all the time, but as soon as I am on air I forget about all my worries and am just in that moment of communication with my listeners.Hugo on his wedding day with Joan in . The couple have one daughter and four grandchildren“The same with anytime I go out on stage and pick up a microphone to sing. Those moments are magical to me.”The wee man from Strabane certainly has musical kudos.In the early s, he was spotted on a TV talent show on RTE and signed by the then fledgling Release Records, which later spawned such stars as Philomena Begley, Ray Lynam and Eurovision star Jonny Logan.By the time he was , he had formed his own band, Hugo Duncan and the Tall Men, and had a number one hit in the Irish charts with Dear God.Hugo and his only daughter Suzanne. The broadcaster says his family is his proudest achievement alongside singing, performing and broadcasting. Duncan says he is never happier than when he is on air and forgets all his personal troubles as soon as he begins his weekly show on BBC Radio UlsterThe ever popular broadcaster explains how his music career took off when the showband era was at its height. At first he could only play three or so chords on the guitar with a capo, but he didn’t let that deter him, and while muso bosses at first demurred at making him a frontman because of his diminutive stature, they eventually relented.“I used to sing on my own in bars in Strabane and all over, then I was gigging with a wee band all over the country for £ or £. a night. That was certainly a long time ago. “I remember I turned  on a Thursday, March ,  I was married the following Thursday and the following Thursday fortnight my mother Susie who raised me on her own died.Hugo having a lark at an outside broadcast pre-pandemic. During lockdown he most missed driving as he likes to travel all over the country from his native Strabane to Kerry, Waterford, Wexford and other parts of the Republic“A close friend of mine, Theo, was a presenter on Highland Radio, who was in a band called The Polka Dots who were managed by Barney Curley. I would say my voice is good, but I’m definitely no Mario Lanza. “The management team tried to oust me because I was small, five foot five . They wanted a traditional six foot frontman, but then they went with Hugo Duncan and The Tall Men, because my friend Pio McCann said to them, “Well, are you looking for a singer or a male model ’ And so I was signed up.He added: “When we had our hit with Dear God in the Irish charts we were walking on air. We lived for today and tomorrow would look after itself. We were at one point one of the top three bands in Ireland. “But then I got into the drink in a big way, from the early s until the  December , and I have not had an alcoholic drink since then, thank God. I just stick to Coca-Cola or orange juice, but I still love being in bars.”He met his we Joan, the love of his le, while they were both working at a nylon factory in Strabane and he credits her almost entirely with keeping him grounded.Hugo recalls: “I was backward about coming forwards on the matter. She used to work in the Gorey Cinema in Newtownstewart selling ice cream, but even when we were courtin’ she wouldn’t have given me a free one.“We were courtin’ from , for  months, then I was working a night sht and I was standing in the hallway of her own house to give her a good night kiss. “There was a song on the radio playing ‘I will never be married, I’ll be no man’s we’ and I just said ‘Will you marry me ’ And that was it. It all happened up against the coats.”A huge hit on the air waves, and particularly with an older demographic of listeners, although plenty of young country music fans tune in frequently too, he is sustained by his Christian faith.“I believe in God and I would pray every day, but I wouldn’t force my religion on anybody. “People say we are two communities here, but we both, Protestant and Catholic, have far more in common than what ides us. “We all bleed when we are cut, we all cry when we are hurt. “I love that my programme goes to every part of Northern Ireland and I think this mutual love of country music can bring us all together - everyone loves the best of country music old and new across Ulster.”‘I WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY AS MUCH AS I CAN’“My new year’s resolutions are to broadcast as much as I can, sing as much as I can and make people happy as much as I can,” says Hugo, who does come across as one of the most cheery people you could meet and that palpable sense of bonhomie and banter and good craic is so apparent on the air waves that it’s no wonder his show is such a hit.He started out in radio after being offered a slot at a station based in Donegal.Hugo recalls: “I began on Donegal Radio and then moved to Radio Foyle, doing  minutes here a and there and then I got a show with Radio Ulster, initially on a Saturday night, and I began to say during a wee teaser ‘Now we’ll play a song for the children before they go to bed, so phone in and tell your Uncle Hugo what you would like to hear played.’ “And then that moniker just stuck with me.”Uncle Hugo, as he prefers to be known, joined Radio Foyle during the s doing holiday relief, after which he was offered a job presenting his own weekly show. In October , he began presenting on BBC Radio Ulster.UNCLE HUGO UP THERE WITH THE NEWS LETTER’S BILLY KENNEDY AS COUNTRY MUSIC CONNOISSEURThough a much-loved radio star, an adept performer and someone with a forensic knowledge of country music to rival the News Letter’s very own in-house expert Billy Kennedy, Hugo insists that his proudest achievement in le is without question his family.“My we Joan, my daughter Suzanne and my grandchildren are the lights of my le - absolutely. “But after that I love being able to sing and entertain and more than anything, from the soles of my feet to the very top of my scalp, to try to bring people joy. I just love trying to make people happy and seeing a smile on their faces. “Also, I once sang in the Royal Albert Hall, at Villanova University and in New York.“I love singing in and around Strabane, in Lford and where in Donegal because there’s a whole network of people I know very well there.“I have always lived in Strabane, I love Strabane and I intend to die in Strabane.”I ask him why he thinks the popularity of country music is so predominant across the province.“I think it’s because so many of a certain generation grew up in the showband era and a lot of them were popularising country music. “From the s on the showbands and country music were very much loved here.“The next generation of Irish country singers coming along like Derek Ryan and Nathan Carter and Lisa McHugh, things are much more dferent for them in that they’re so much more business and PR savvy but a lot of the time they are doing covers of older songs like stuff from Foster and Allen and all the older great country music stars - there are so many of them close to my heart that it’s virtually impossible to list them all.“Butyou’re chatting about Irish country music, then a hugely important artist, in my view, is Daniel O’Donnell. “He would get up and sing for ten people with as much dedication and enthusiasm as he would sing for , people, and whatever the size of the audience he holds them captive, just in the palm of his hand.“He’s honestly a lovely human being and in my view a top musical performer - one of my absolute favourites, in fact, and someone I deeply respect.”As a celebrity broadcaster Hugo could well get a big head, but he insists this is not the case.“But I do love when I go to supermarkets and people will meet me and ask for photographs and a chat and my we gets angry because I would really stop and chat with everybody, and she’d rather I just pushed the trolley as fast as I can,” he laughs.QA: ‘GOD BLESS LITTLE CHILDREN, WHILE THEY’RE TOO YOUNG TO HATE’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories I grew up with just my mother Susie and I in a terrace house. There was always music and a welcome in our house and my wee mother used to say she was always singing that she was “always a bridesmaid and never a bride”.We were very close to our neighbours. In those days nobody locked their doors and I was always really well looked after. I would have went in there, say next door, and they would say ‘Come on in here, Hugh’ - never Hugo, ‘To get a cup of tea and a piece of bread and butter and that will do you until you get your dinner.’ And then my godmother was always making buns for me, and I was in and out of all the houses nearby on my street.Tell us about your school days I was never academic and I was always more drawn to music, especially once my mother bought me a band kit with Providence cheques, I was always singing and gigging about the place. I think I have a short attention span.I didn’t mind arithmetic, but once they got into all those equations and all, then I switched off. I hated PE and sports.What is the secret of your the longevity of your marriage Joan is the backbone of everything, and our daughter Suzanne arrived just a year after our marriage in . We now have four grandchildren, Jake, Ellie-Mae, Molly-Jay,and Katie-Sue. Things were tough when Suzanne had cancer but we got through it all and I really think my Joan is the one who holds all the family together - she has a very strong Christian faith.Tell us your favourite country music artists Tom T Hall, a real singer songwriter and story-teller, and I actually went to his home on two dferent occasions to interview him with a film crew. He wrote a song called Old Dogs and Children and Watermelon Wine and the line of the song that really hit me and spoke to me from the moment I heard it was ‘God bless little children, while they’re still too young to hate’. I also love George Jones, Merle Haggard, Buck Owen - all the old country singers.But I love all kinds of music and singing all kinds of songs. I appreciate traditional, jazz and lots of other genres, but country always comes first. What is your favourite way to spend a day I love driving, and being in transit. I used to do -k miles a year driving up and down Ireland, all over. From home to Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Wexford, Galway, almost every county. And I just love getting out and singing and performing with a band because the buzz you get from doing what you do on stage is second to none.Listen to Hugo Duncan on BBC Radio Ulster, Wednesdays, from .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"key date ahead as all restrictions to be reviewed ","story":"Work starts on £m hotel plan at former military base   DUP saysgovernment will axe double-jobbing due to lack of support in NI then why won’t it axe the Irish Sea border NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeople‘Key date’ ahead as ‘all restrictions’ to be reviewedThe next Stormont Executive meeting could be a “key date” as Northern Ireland hopes to move out of the coronavirus pandemic, Health Minister Robin Swann has said.By Niall DeeneySaturday, nd January , : amUpdated Saturday, nd January , : am  \"       \"  He was looking ahead to the next meeting on February , after the Executive agreed to remove several of the restrictions still in place when it met on Thursday.Following that meeting, a spokesperson for the Executive Office at Stormont confirmed that “all remaining covid measures will be reviewed” on February .While Mr Swann has sounded a note of cautious optimism, it is far from certain the remaining restrictions will be dispensed with when the Executive meets again in under three weeks.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

A number of restrictions were changed including the ending of table service only in pubs and restaurants. Jade Dawson and Lydia Hope, who are on holiday from England, enjoy a drink in the DuKe of York in Belfast City Centre. Picture by Jonathan Porter PressEyeThe News Letter has spoken to several members of the Stormont health committee, from a range of parties, who expressed caution when it comes to the lting of remaining rules.The Alliance Party’s Paula Bradshaw said it would be “unrealistic” to assume all remaining rules will be dropped so soon.Mr Swann’s UUP colleague, Alan Chambers, said he is “reluctant to read too much into” the announcement that all remaining restrictions would soon be reviewed.The DUP’s Deborah Erskine, however, urged ministers to remember that coronavirus restrictions are only to be kept in place as long as they are deemed “absolutely necessary”.Minister for Health Robin SwannMr Swann, meanwhile, spoke to the media in Antrim after a swathe of restrictions were relaxed, including an end to the legal requirement for Covid certication to enter some hospitality venues, and the reopening of nightclubs. “I have always taken the decision at the time in regards to the advice that was put forward via my chief medical officer and chief scientic adviser, so February , while it will be a key date, let’s make sure we get there safely and as collectively as we can,” he said.“I would still encourage people to follow the guidance, follow the regulations that are still in place and take the opportunities to come forward and get their vaccines and their boosters.“There are three weeks to go and I want to keep the trajectory of this virus going in the same direction as it has been, and that’s downwards.”Ms Bradshaw, speaking to the News Letter, said: “Everything, at every stage, of every Executive meeting has been reviewed and looked at so I think it’s unrealistic to assume that there will certainly be this huge lting of remaining restrictions as there has been in England.“I don’t think we will see them go away as quickly as the announcement of that date would suggest. “We are still getting , cases per day. I think that, obviously, there is less death but there are still people dying every day and there are still a lot of people on ventillators fighting for their lives. “We are certainly not out of the woods yet.”Mr Chambers said: “It’s not unusual that the Executive are going to review all restrictions in early February. “I’m reluctant to read too much into it, because at every Executive meeting everything is under review. “There isn’t anything unusual about that, and I wouldn’t read too much into ‘nudge, nudge, wink, wink’ suggestions that have been coming from some members of the Executive.“Yes, everything will be considered, but it will absolutely depend on the scientic and medical advice.

Can I urge the Prime Minister to listen to the majority and ask him not to move the government amendment in the other place later today ”Mr Johnson replied: “I am advised that... the amendment in question is going to be withdrawn.”Following the announcement, Sir Jeffrey said: “I haven’t spoken to the government about this so you will have to ask them their rationale. I’m not angry at all – I’m full of energy. I’m focussed on the job that I have, I count it an honour and a privilege to represent the people of my constituency.”“We felt that the amendment offered an opportunity, perhaps for a small number of senior representatives to continue to have a voice at Westminster while we aretrying to resolve issues such as the [NI] Protocol. But... I am looking forward to the Assembly elections,” he told the BBC’s Evening Extra programme.Sorcha Eastwood, an Alliance Assembly in Lagan Valley, described the government’s rethink as “a good day for democracy,” and added: “It is up to the DUP to now recommit to the Assembly, and make sure that we get on with the jobs that we are elected to do – that means holding one mandate at a time.”If Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey is elected to Stormont in May, Ms Eastwood could well be the Alliance candidate to contesting the resulting Westminster by-election that would now have to take place.The DUP has two sitting MLAs in the constituency – First Minister Paul Givan and Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Photo: NY photography   David Paul LarsonBelfast artist Brian John Spencer believes the key reason young unionists are not willing to speak up in the media is because they have lost all connections with their past.“So, middle class unionists become ashamed of their history because of the way media - even the big Hollywood blockbusters - has made them feel ashamed of the RUC,” he said.But he believes there is much to be proud of.“The Ulster Covenant was signed by half a million people - compared to the Irish proclamation, which was only signed by seven.”Darrin Foster says leadership in unionism could do much more but that the media is also to blame.A huge proportion of unionists will have relatives who signed the Covenant, he notes.“That was my way of finding identity and root in Ireland as opposed to someone who was made to feel foriegn and alien.”He was prompted to explore his roots by comment such as that he encountered while on an Erasmus exchange where he met a fellow student from Co Mayo who was a keen fan of Irish nationalist movies.“He was watching ‘The wind that shakes the barley [film] and told me - ‘Give us back our land!’ There were flippant comments passed off as a joke but there is an underlying sentiment there. “That prompted me to reverse my deculturalisation and that made me cling to the Ulster Covenant. I went on my journey and found I have at least two great grandparents who signed it, possibly three.“It made me realise thatyou go into a bar in Dublin, every other bar has the Irish Proclamation and a lot of young people have it on their walls, or icons of Michael Collins.“Nolan simply verbaliseda sentiment that I would sense. I have heard it said by a soft unionist playwright that when he did a play on the UDR it was almost impossible to get young actors to take the roles.“Young unionists tend to be a lot more consumerist and disconnected from their history. The past is not as big a deal for them. They don’t have the grievance that is passed down the way nationalists would.“Nationalists would talk about how they couldn’t get jobs for example though unionists do have cause for grievance too. I know a businessman in Belfast whose grandfather was intimidated out of Monaghan, but for some reason it is not as acceptable to say that.“I don’t knowmy art has suffered butI was a young artist painting Michael Collins or the Irish Proclamation or railing against Brexit I think I would have a much bigger  - but I can’t deny my history.“So I enjoy painting Edward Carson and unionist figures, but that doesn’t really get any traction. I think it is as much to do with a bigger overarching culture of what mainstream institutions want to promote.“I know the overarching culture in the media, Hollywood and arts [about Irish nationalism], I know how that makes me feel a bit abandonedor alienatedand not spoken for.“It is a primal feeling that hits you in the chest. There are some things that are said and other things that aren’t - the full picture is not being spoken so I feel compelled as someone who has a bit of a  with his art and writing to speak out about it.“I was so alarmed by Michael D Higgins’ focus on the Black and Tans activity in Balbriggan and burning of Cork in his speech last year. I thought - by all means draw attention to that - but why are you not also talking about the IRA burning down Shane’s Castle and Belfast Customs House and Liverpool Docks  And why not remember how the IRA intercepted letters from the Black and Tans and found out their home addresses in Cheshire and burnt out their families from their farms  Why are those stories not being told too “The feeling I got of being told ‘you are not legitimate, you are alien’ was in  . That made me start my blog that gave me the armoryto put down these roots that had evaporated.“The big Hollywood blockbuster movies - The wind that shakes the barley and Michael Collins - portrays all the British as the villains and the nationalists as the good guys but in fact the history is incredibly nuanced and complex.”Twenty-six-year old Darrin Foster, a TUV assembly candidate from Upper Bann, felt the issue could be lack of opportunities.“I know we have problems getting anybody  but [party leader] Jim Allister speaking in the media. They don’t want anybody . They phone us looking for someone to speak andwe say ‘Jim is not available but I have got this guy’, they will say, ‘No, sorry it’s all right’. So there is actually a perception that they don’t want anybody .”Darrin posts his political views on Facebook but not on Twitter because “all you get is abuse”.He adds: “If you look at my campaign video on Twitter there is just abuse about what you are wearing, where you are from, what you look like....”.He notices other young unionists posting their views get similar volumes of abuse, usually from anonymous accounts. Personally he would be very comfortable to speak about politics in the media.“Obviously someone of my age may have a lot less experience than someone older. But you are only going to get experience through doing it.”He does agree with Stephen Nolan that there are not many opportunities for personal development for aspiring unionist politicians, the TUV being the exception.“Nationalists and unionists are given equal time to speak in the media but unionists are questioned dferently,” he adds.“If a unionist is speaking on Brexit and the union you will be challenged much more on that than someone expressing an opinion in favour of a United Ireland. You will be challenged to explain ‘What are the benefits of the union  Why do you think there shouldn’t be a border in the Irish Sea ’ “Butsomebody says there shouldn’t be a land border it is just let go.”He also feels unionist perspectives on legacy are not welcomed in the media.“The narrative on soldiers is always about what they shouldn’t have been doing, though it was very rare indeed that a soldier was doing something wrong in the scale of things. But itis never noted that they wouldn’t have neededto be here in the first placethe IRA weren’t blowing up the country.”Some unionists feared for their careersthey spoke openly about what they believed.‘William’, a rural unionist in his early twenties, thought Stephen Nolan was “absolutely bang on” about the lack of training for young unionists.“Some people say there are young articulate unionists but that they are scared to put their head above the parapets, but there has been a generational problem where we haven’ttrained young unionists to think in a political way the way the other side have. I think that is a real problem,” he said.“I think they are afraid but I also think they are ill equipped. I thinkthere is a culture of shame. Our society by and large has made unionists - particularly young unionists - feel that being a unionist is something to be embarrassed about.“In the way the media speaks about unionists, for example, somebody like myself who is anti-Belfast Agreement, will be labeled an extremist. It kind of makes it taboo. “There is a problem with unionists being ill equipped - there is no doubt in my mind.”The advantage with nationalists, he feels, may not so much be formal training as culture.“Nationalists have a realisation from a young age that they need to articulate their aspirations in a way that we don’t. Unionism hasn’tadjusted to a modern Northern Ireland wherewe have to make our case. Young unionists are only given tickbox opportunities where nationalists get genuine opportunities.”He argues that the age profile of nationalist MLAs is increasingly much younger than unionists MLAs, for example.Asked what part of his culture he is made to feel ashamed of, he replies: “All of it. In terms of legacy, in culture. A shame has permeated our society around the unionist narrative of the past, particularly around the security forces.”He believes society has “smeared” the reputations of the RUC and UDR unfairly and young unionists feel they can’t be associated with them. “Culturally, particularlythe Orange tradition has been constantly maligned in our society where it is now seen as taboo to associate with it. There are ‘useful unionists’, but to be one you have to be socially progressive - pro gay marriage and abortion - and you have to be pro Belfast Agreement to be seen as legitimate. Otherwise you are a non-entity.”He believes that the Belfast Agreement has been responsible for “the legitimisation process of those who engaged in terrorism and bloodshed and the demonisation of those who tried to protect our society”.But he is clear on the way forward: “The responsibility lies with our political parties and the loyal orders. There is no form or means for a young unionist to learn the political trade”.‘George’, a university graduate in his twenties, believes that the lack of desire from young unionists to engage politically comes from universities.“I have been in tutorials whereyou say anything that isn’t from the playbook of nationalism or Irish republicanism you are shot down immediately - shot down by other students and even lecturers - they don’t come to your assistance. Often they are cheering on the nationalist perspective.“If you suggest the security forces were right to fight terrorism and defend democracy and freedom - that is just not how the university will allow you to speak. The orthodoxy that is taught is that any discrimination, perceived or actual, against Catholics fully justied the IRA campaign. Protestant students are made to feel that they can’t speak up against that.”He believes these same dynamics are exactly the same as the pressures young unionists feel against speaking out in wider society and in the media. “Because that is putting your head above the parapet. The Irish republican version of NI history is now the accepted orthodoxy - it is historical revisionism. It is Northern Ireland’s version of cancel culture but it is far more effective here because it is policed by the IRA. “On the mainland it is policed by political correctness which is not nearly as powerful.”An Ulster Unionist Party spokesperson commented that it is committed to offering “a positive, confident brand of unionism as Northern Ireland enters its second century”. He added: “Our youth wing – the Ulster Young Unionists – has a presence on Northern Ireland’s University campuses and is open to students and non students alike.“They are encouraged to get involved in politics and regularly join canvass teams across Northern Ireland at election time. Some have gone on to become councillors and the Party is keen to promote new blood as part of the necessary and healthy process of change and renewal. Members of the Young Unionists have appeared on ious TV and radio shows – including the Nolan Show - and have been encouraged to do so. As a party we would encourage young unionists – whether aligned with the Ulster Unionist Party or not – to make their voices heard when opportunities present themselves.”:: Want to joint the conversation  Email [email#protected]MORE NEWS:Policing Board ‘not aware’ of existence of PSNI unit monitoring IRA activityPSNI reveals why Paramilitary Crime Task Force investigates UVF, UDA and INLA - but not the IRADUP MLA: I was assaulted at QUB for being a unionist activistQUB Students Union President in row over IRA Facebook postsQUB ‘silent’ on student social media rules after IRA Facebook rowSinn Fein law lecturer won’t condemn IRA murder of QUB academicLodge Le: investing in the future with Pioneers projectPanel to look at Protestant boys’ underachievement is ‘too imbalanced’A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
