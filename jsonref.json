I’m not sure what I’m going to do for the next 30 years as I’ve been blessed beyond words in my life so far,’ she began. ‘Thank you to everyone for coming along for the ride the last 11 years with me. My family and friends for entertaining my super fandom of the Titanic movie.‘Last night was the best night of my life. Here’s a couple pics. I’m absolutely fucked, not sure I’ll make it out the house again!‘Ps Childish Gambino how the hell do you have time to offer us so much greatness on so many platforms. I adore you x’In one shot she’s stood on the famous staircase from the cruise liner (it’s not THE staircase from the cruise liner, that one is chilling a few kilometres down in the Atlantic Ocean…too soon?), while in another she’s somehow got her mitts on an old-timey life vest.We should probably note that, yes, this could border on the inappropriate seeing as a few thousand people perished on the Titanic in 1912…While on the face of it this looks like one of the greatest parties of all time (and we’re gutted our invite got lost in the post), which counted her best mate Alan Carr as a guest, for some the theme was a little jarring. On the whole fans have taken to Twitter to celebrate the singer’s party choice, some Twitter users branded the theme ‘inappropriate’ claiming it celebrated the deaths of thousands of people, and for some the wearing and gifting of life jackets was a step too far.One wrote: ‘Isn’t this kindavery inappropriate? Adele’s Titanic themed birthday party had them dancing in life jackets… Thousands of people actually died.’Another added: ‘Does @Adele realize that the titanic movie was based off the actually sinking of that ship where 1500 people died? Not exactly a good party theme.’If you\u0027ve got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the  Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we\u0027d love to hear from you.MORE: Kim Cattrall gives blessing to Alan Carr as he teases role of Samantha in ‘Sex and the City reboot’MORE: Adele twerked to Beyonce’s Coachella set in her living room just like every one of us"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sei_10749325.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"boy 13 comes back life day doctors turn off life support","story":"Trenton McKinley’s parents had just signed papers to have their son’s organs donated after he suffered a severe brain trauma (Picture: WALA Fox 10)A 13-year-old boy opened his eyes a day before doctors were due to turn off his life support machine.Trenton McKinley’s parents had just signed papers to have their son’s organs donated after he suffered a severe brain trauma.The teenager, from Alabama, suffered seven skull fractures and has been in hospital ever since.‘I hit the concrete and the trailer landed on top of my head.

But what is Martin Lewis’s net worth?Who is Martin Lewis?Born Martin Steven Lewis on May 9, 1972 in Withington, Manchester, he is an English financial journalist and founder of the website MoneySavingExpert.com.He lost his mother in a car accident at a young age and later in life, went on to become a patron of the children’s bereavement charity Grief Encounter as well as an advocate for life insurance.Martin studied government and law at the London School of Economics and went on to complete a postgraduate course in broadcast journalism in Cardiff.His first job was at a financial communications consultancy, the Brunswick Group in London and later, became a producer for the BBC Business Unit working on BBC Radio Five Live business programmes.Martin was also an editor of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and then moved to Sky’s Simply Money where he formed his Money Saving Expert persona.After the collapse of Simply Money, he wrote for the Deal of the Week column in the Sunday Express and was then granted slots on Channel 5’s Open House with Gloria Hunniford.Martin returned to BBC for a short while before presenting a daytime television series on ITV in 2005 called Make Me Rich as well as Channel Five show It Pays to Watch.He then presented money saving programmes on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine and now appears on This Morning, The Wright Stuff and began presenting The Martin Lewis Money Show.Martin Lewis is married to former 5 News weather presenter Lara Lewington in May 31, 2009 and the couple had a daughter in November 2012.          Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis pictured with his Order of the British Empire (OBE) medal alongside his wife Lara Lewington at an Investiture ceremony in February 2015 at Buckingham PalaceMartin Lewis on Question TimeMoney Saving Expert Martin Lewis was applauded by Question Time viewers after he slammed Labour Party MP Chi Onwurah over student finance claims.He accused politicians of dissuading young people from attending university by referring to the fee payments as student ‘debt’ and said that an entire generation had been ‘mis-educated’.He said: \u0027It is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame... It\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Martin explained that the price of attending university was irrelevant and the repayments are based on salary, which means that those who earn a lot after completing their studies, will naturally have to pay back more.Ms Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central said: \u0027If somebody, and particularly somebody from a working class background, if somebody has 57,000 in debt,\u0027 but Martin interrupted her to say: ‘Don\u0027t tell them! Politicians do this all the time. You can\u0027t make political points.\u0027You put off young people from underprivileged backgrounds from going to university with a fear of debt by framing it as a debt when you know it doesn\u0027t work like that.\u0027Politicians need to take responsibility. Your political football that you and all the parties have used student finance to be has mis-educated a generation about how student finance works and it is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame because there are people from poor backgrounds on television - I saw a programme two weeks ago - saying I can\u0027t afford to go to university.\u0027Well, you know what, it is expensive, it\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Ms Onwurah responded: \u0027It is really, really important to recognise that tuition fees are an obstacle for students going into university. It\u0027s psychological but a lot of the world is psychological. How things are perceived is what informs people\u0027s choice.\u0027You can argue to re-educate, or you can argue, as we have done, to abolish tuition fees.\u0027Martin Lewis suing FacebookIn April 2018, Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis revealed that he is in the process of suing Facebook for publishing dozens of adverts using his image to promote scams.He said that the social media platform had used his name to ‘rip off vulnerable people’. He continued: \u0027I feel sick each time I hear of another victim being conned because of trust they wrongly thought they were placing in me.‘I believe politicians have totally missed the impact of social media companies on real people and their pockets. It is about time they took this seriously.’Martin went on to say that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg ‘pretends to be an honest and campaigning man but his company is a facilitator of criminal scammers … They have known about these scam adverts for years, and they are still happy to roll around in their dirty money.’Facebook has been accused of publishing more than 50 fake Martin Lewis adverts, with the majority promoting schemes trading in Bitcoin, which Martin claimed were actually binary trading firms.Binary trading is a risky form of gambling on the stock market that sees most investors lose money.The Financial Conduct Authority has said almost 100 firms are illegally offering such investments to UK consumers and warned of online firms that take money, place no bets for customers then break contact.Martin has asked Facebook to remove the adverts multiple times but they are left up for days or weeks before being taken down and then reappear days later.A Facebook spokesman said: ‘We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed.’Martin Lewis net worthMartin Lewis’s net worth has accumulated to approximately £73 million, according to Wealtholino.In 2012, BBC News reported that Martin sold MoneySavingExpert.com for up to £87 million.Carnival Cruise Line: A history of flooding and other disastersRoyal Wedding weather: Will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0027s big day be a washout?Met Gala 2018: Date, theme, hosts and moreMarvel character searches on Pornhub surged before Avengers: Infinity War releaseJennifer Aniston joins Brad Pitt and others in objecting to The Weinstein Company saleGrey\u0027s Anatomy preview hints at Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw\u0027s leavingCinco de Mayo: How to celebrate in style Who is Matthew Lawrence?

In his hospital bed, he soon realised that his voracious appetite for work meant that he’d pushed his body and mind too hard.‘I’m a gulper, a gobbler-down of life. I wolf experiences down,’ he later said. Thankfully, the stroke hit the left side of his brain — which meant his memory and speech were not impaired.

Yes, we all fear the words ‘tumour’, ‘cancer’ and ‘malignant’. Yet I know that Andrew has more courage and determination in his little finger, even the one hardest hit by the stroke, than most people do in their entire body.Moreover, this no-nonsense Scot would be appalled to be called ‘courageous’.

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has asked parliament\u0027s standards watchdog to examine the claims about the Speaker - which he insists are untrue. Tory MP Paul Scully said the \u0027inconsistency\u0027 of Mr Bercow\u0027s moods frustrated MPs.He told the BBC\u0027s Westminster Hour: \u0027There are some days he could probably do with taking the medicament he prescribes backbenchers every other Prime Minister\u0027s Questions himself.

Sometimes, the images combine respect with a touch of humor, such as the popular portrayal of him riding a bear, his shirtless torso showing impressive muscles.

All these Asian things are sort of unpleasant to him. Putin\u0027s nature is quite reserved.

He had chosen the role because he felt he was becoming a “Bond slave” and the film was about as far away as possible from the cartoon smoothness of 007. Cannes wasn’t much interested in that distinction, however. Goldfinger had come out the previous year Thunderball was on its way. When Connery cruised the Croisette in an open-topped sports car it was Bond, “Mr Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” as the New York Times called him, the crowds wanted to see.Connery, for all his reluctance to identify with his character, clearly didn’t disappoint. Has he ever looked more Bondlike than in this picture? Eyebrow raised, catching the eye of a beautiful face in the crowd, keeping his head and his tailoring on point, while all around him are losing theirs. This was his first time at Cannes, but he knew exactly what Cannes demanded: it was the place actors had always come to act most like film stars.This year’s festival, which opens next week, will conjure similar images: the same spring Riviera light, the same rococo facades, the same paparazzi scrum around an icon. Just as the photograph of Connery harked back to the welcome and confected spectacle that the film festival represented after the war, so this year’s images will reference the less inhibited atmosphere of the 60s. Glamour never goes out of style – or at least so Cannes insists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdcb052d3d88788bab78b51f6b0675f6f4bea98a/0_197_1329_797/master/1329.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87415d4367887db571ebca3f250f7d0b","title":"from degas muse to modern aerialist exhibition charts black women in circus","story":"Show opening in Sheffield looks at hidden history of female and black circus performersMiss La La was the star of the show when Edgar Degas painted her in 1879 hanging by her teeth from the roof of the Cirque Fernando in Paris, but in 2018 she will share the spotlight with another young black aerialist, Blaze Tarsha, who had never heard of her nor had any idea of the long tradition of black performers in some of the most famous shows.Tarsha, a performer with NoFit State circus, is creating a film to be shown beside the painting, which will travel on a rare loan from the National Gallery in London to Sheffield’s Weston Park Museum for an exhibition in July on the hidden history of female and black circus performers. Tarsha’s circus career began when she mastered the unicycle in a week while hanging around bored as her mother, a professional chef, was cooking for a juggling convention. Both mother and daughter now tour with NoFit State.Tarsha performs a spectacular aerial act in a suspended ring, while Miss La La’s show-stopping finale was slightly more eccentric. Although Degas portrayed her in a relatively conventional pose, her most famous trick – repeated when she and her troupe visited London – came when a bronze cannon was lifted into the air suspended from a strap held in her teeth while she hung from the trapeze.“When I told her about Miss LaLa, Blaze said: ‘But I thought I was the only one,’” said Prof Vanessa Toulmin, the joint curator of the Circus! exhibition and founder of the National Fairground and Circus Archive at Sheffield University. “The history of black performers is there but it’s not always obvious. You have to look for it.”Toulmin pointed out that Degas had been interested in the athletic human body almost as an architectural element silhouetted against the roof of the circus, and that it was not clear in the painting that Miss La La was black – though that is obvious from some 19th-century circus posters and in the only photograph Toulmin has been able to find of the performer. Degas, who produced several paintings and drawings of Miss La La, referred to her in letters as “my beautiful negress”.Her real name was Olga Brown and she is said to have been born in Prussia – present-day Poland – in 1858 and placed with a circus by her mother at the age of nine. She performed a flying trapeze and a human cannon ball act with the Kaira Troupe, at the Cirque Fernando and in circuses and music halls across Europe, including appearances at the Folies Bergère in Paris, Royal Aquarium in London in 1879 and the Gaiety theatre in Manchester. She moved to the US where Toulmin – who believes Brown may well have changed her name once or several times again – loses track of her.The exhibition opens in Sheffield and versions of it will be seen later in Great Yarmouth and Newcastle. It is part of the Circus 250 festival, celebrating the anniversary of a British art form that went on to conquer the world of entertainment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/314ec7a5ae0bd3b76e28ff2c31d2662cf47e5dd8/982_410_5738_3443/master/5738.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e467e6b68c3d7ea2980dc6b08268a852","title":"blade runner sheffield scissor maker in pictures","story":"Arriving in Sheffield 25 years ago, Grace Horne’s plan of being taught to be a cutler by the renowned Stan Shaw did not go to plan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cecb584be515350f50ee731f4b0185280a78bd18/80_18_2285_1371/master/2285.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62265868a54064b892a94da2cceebf05","title":"michael morpurgo my family fought for peace not for brexit","story":"The War Horse author remembers the uncles who inspired his latest book, In the Mouth of the Wolf, and who taught him that peace must come before prosperityI have just walked around the ancient ramparts of Ypres, whose name became the byword for stubborn allied resistance against the German invasion of Belgium in 1914 at the beginning of the first world war. It was an invasion that forced 250,000 Belgian refugees to get in boats and seek safety in Britain. They came. They were welcomed. They were cared for. This should be remembered, perhaps, as a lesson in kindness for us today.In the evening, I stood in the bitter cold under the Menin Gate as the Ypres fire brigade bugles played the Last Post, as they have done every evening since 1928, except during the German occupation of Belgium in the second world war. As the echoes faded, I thought of my uncle Pieter Cammaerts, who died in the second world war – in the RAF, aged 21, in 1941. Uncle Pieter is buried in the church at Radlett, his name is on the war memorial in the Hertfordshire town, but almost no one alive today knew him. He died two years before I was born and I know him only from photographs, from family stories. But so much of the reason I was standing under the gate, so much of why I had written my most recent book, In the Mouth of the Wolf, and War Horse and Private Peaceful, was because of my uncle Pieter, and my uncle Francis.My uncles have fascinated and inspired me since I was a child. In my family, their lives are legendary. All my writing life I had wanted to tell their story. Writing it was my way of trying to remember them, of acknowledging my debt to them, and all the millions of “mouthless dead” of two wars. They had fought for peace. I had enjoyed that peace in a Europe that, for the most part, had decided enough was enough, that war was not the way. I lived in a European Union. We members argued often, but no longer fought. Togetherness seemed to be working. Peace had become too precious. My uncles were among those who had enabled that reconciliation to happen.The two brothers, though very different – Francis, tall, confident and charismatic, Pieter, smaller, tentative and fragile – were close. They came from a Christian socialist family, their father, Emile, was a Belgian poet and free thinker, later art critic, philosopher and professor of Belgian studies at London University. Their mother, Tita, was an actor, a devoted Christian, a formidable and highly principled woman. There were four equally formidable sisters, my mother among them. It was a house of music, theatre and books, of heated discussion and strong opinions. Holidays were often spent walking in the Ardennes, which the family loved.Francis, a socialist and pacifist, went to Cambridge and became a teacher. Pieter went to Rada in London and was starting out on a promising career as an actor when war broke out in September 1939. He joined up almost at once. Francis, following his convictions, became a conscientious objector, and was sent to work as a shepherd on a Lincolnshire farm. The Germans were soon invading Belgium, through the family’s beloved Ardennes, and marching into France, towards the Channel. Invasion was threatening.In 1941, Pieter, now a sergeant observer in the RAF, was killed when his plane crashed in St Eval in Cornwall. The family were devastated. Francis, still shepherding but now a husband and father, decided he could no longer stand by while others were fighting for his family’s survival, and for the beliefs and freedoms that were so precious to him.He confided his dilemma to Harry Rée, his great friend, fellow teacher and pacifist, who, unbeknown to Francis, had already joined the Special Operations Executive, SOE. Francis spoke fluent French. Harry said that could be useful, and that he would put him in touch with someone in London. Francis walked into an interview in an upstairs room in Baker Street a shepherd, and came out an officer in the SOE.After months of gruelling training, during which he could say nothing to his wife, Nan, or his friends and family, Francis found himself in German occupied France. In Paris, he realised at once that fellow agents there were compromised. Within days more than 60 were rounded up and shot. Francis by this time had made his way south, where he found himself organising and supplying resistance fighters, the Maquis, across a swath of southern France, an army that in the end numbered more than 10,000 men and women, comprising communists, socialists and Gaullists, from all walks of life, all determined to rid their country of the invader.So this pacifist uncle was now a secret agent, fighting the enemy, living in constant danger of capture and death. But he proved to be an agent who had all the right instincts. Trust, he knew, was everything. He had seen others’ mistakes. He picked his few friends with great care. He was courageous, and scrupulous about security, never sleeping more than two nights in one place. He inspired and gave great loyalty.The Germans put a huge price on his head, but he was never betrayed. He managed to outwit both the Gestapo and their counterparts in the dreaded French Milice, and survived these perilous years through his skill and bravery, but also through the love and courage of his comrades. He returned after the liberation of France to his family, and to his life as a headteacher, and a principal of teacher-training colleges in England and in Botswana.When Francis was an old man, I visited him in Le Pouget, the village in south-east France where he came to live in his latter years, to be closer to his family and his old friends from the resistance. Only if pressed would he speak of his war years. Two weeks before he died, the villagers gave him a 90th birthday party. The children sang, the mayor made a speech. He was a legend there, too, not only in his family.More and more I wanted to tell his story. It was important to the family and to me, especially now Britain had decided to leave the European Union. The Mouth of the Wolf begins with an old Englishman being given a 90th birthday party by the people of his French village. Tired, he goes to bed and remembers those people who could not be there with him that day. He talks to them, remembers with them the joys and the sorrows. But it was difficult, I found, to settle to my writing in the midst of the post-referendum furore. It came to me as I was trying to weave the story of my two uncles, that in all the bitter bickering about Europe, few if any were talking about why the EU was there, how it came to be. My uncles had done what they had done to defeat tyranny, to bring peace and reconciliation. They knew, we all know, that for hundreds of years, thousands even, European states had fought one another. Trade wars, religious wars, power grabs, land grabs, disputes between kings and emperors – our continent has been almost constantly at war over the centuries.In the last century, the inclination of the great European powers towards belligerence and self-destruction led us into the two most destructive wars the world has ever known. Then, out of the rubble, out of all the grieving and misery, France and Germany, the two great nations at the heart of these titanic struggles, decided that the only way to ensure peace was through trade that if they created close, mutually beneficial links, there would never be any need or wish to fight, that prosperity, security and peace would be interlocked.Soon, six nations gathered together to create this trading bloc. Europe’s peoples could see the sense of this. More wanted to join. So the new Europe, changing its name and much else besides, grew in numbers, grew closer, and did help to bring lasting peace. But it became bureaucratic, less democratic, put ever more stars on its flag, and created a new currency. The mutual benefits of prosperity and stability were evident, but were not shared equitably. We were a member of a club in which we felt we were losing control over our destiny, where the rules were being changed, which alarmed many. We argued, all the countries argued. But it was still jaw-jaw, not war-war.In this febrile atmosphere came the referendum. I was sure the people would vote to stay in because I thought British people valued peace above all else, and the prosperity most had enjoyed for so long. Yes, there was plenty we did not like about Europe, but we would stay and put that right. I was wrong. But I am sure, too, that the country was wrong, deluded by lies and statistics, by absurd promises. I feel we are now travelling down a path that takes us away from our friends and neighbours. We have told them we don’t like them, that we wish to orce them. They are hurt, upset, angry. Why wouldn’t they be?My uncles’ lives taught me that peace must come first, before prosperity. They helped make Europe a place of peace at last, of free peoples. That’s the Europe, with all its faults, I believe we belong to. That Channel of ours has saved us in the past, often. Now it threatens to separate us. Holding hands across the sea is the only way. It always was. My uncles knew that.• In the Mouth of the Wolf is published by Egmont.

The Seattle-based Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee chain, said it would use the proceeds to return money to shareholders by speeding up a share buyback programme. The transaction does not involve any Starbucks cafes and will involve selling Starbucks bagged coffee, drinks and Nespresso-style pods.The Nestlé name will not appear on Starbucks products. “We do not want the consumer to perceive that Starbucks is now part of a bigger family,” a Nestlé source said.“This global coffee alliance will bring the Starbucks experience to the homes of millions more around the world through the reach and reputation of Nestlé,” the Starbucks chief executive, Kevin Johnson, said. Nestlé and Starbucks are joining forces in a highly fragmented consumer drinks category that has been involved in a string of deals lately. JAB Holding, the private investment firm of Europe’s billionaire Reimann family, has fuelled the consolidation wave with a series of deals, including Douwe Egberts, Peet’s Coffee and Keurig Green Mountain, narrowing the gap with Nestlé. Coffee is popular with younger customers who have grown up with Starbucks. A willingness to pay up for exotic beans and specialty drinks means companies can generate stronger profit margins than in mainstream packaged food.The Nestlé source said it would pay market-linked royalties to Starbucks after the initial fee.

In the next few weeks, the regulator is expected to announce whether it will carry out a broad-brush “phase 1” review, which would last up to 40 days, or go straight to a more detailed “phase 2”, in which it would examine competition concerns at a local level around the UK in a process lasting up to 24 weeks.Campaigners say the environmental impact of the proposed merger and the wider concentration of power in the food retail sector should be considered.Crossley said: “There’s no such thing as a free lunch when it comes to promised price reductions.“Cheaper prices for customers are likely to be unaffordable for farmers, suppliers, farm animals and for the environment. At a time when we need to face up to climatic shocks and resource scarcity, we need a resilient food system – and the best route to resilience is ersity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b11ab9017cb435a525978913a789e7d5","title":"eu core values viktor orban hungary fidesz party expel parliament grouping","story":"Boris Johnson should change his name and move to Hungary. “My policy on cake,” Johnson famously says, “is pro having it and pro eating it.” With this approach to Brexit, the British government will end up neither having its cake nor eating it. Viktor Orbán’s nationalist populist Hungarian\u0026nbspgovernment, by contrast, is triumphantly practising the\u0026nbspJohnson doctrine. It receives more European Union cake per capita than any other member state while mustering nationalist support by biting the Brussels hand that feeds\u0026nbspit. Boris Johnzsönhelyi would be a\u0026nbsphappy\u0026nbsptrooper on the Danube.Poland is also having its cake and eating it. According\u0026nbspto European commission figures, more than half of all public investment in Hungary and Poland in 2015-17 was funded by the EU. I recently visited one of Poland’s poorest regions wherever I went there was a road, a bridge, a marketplace or a train connection being modernised with EU funds. Yet the country’s de facto leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, has eviscerated the independence of the courts, turned public service radio and television into propaganda organs for his Law and Justice party, and continues to pursue Orbánisation à la polonaise. He hasn’t got as far as Orbán, but the consequences of east-central Europe’s largest country sliding into Hungarian-style soft authoritarianism would be larger for the whole EU.Here is a fundamental challenge to anyone who thinks the EU should stand for values of liberal democracy, pluralism, the rule of law and free speech. If it doesn’t defend these values at home, it cannot be credible advocating them abroad.Reflecting on the Orbánisation of Hungary, the political scientist Jan-Werner Müller asks: “Can a dictatorship be a member of the EU?” Of course, Hungary is not yet a dictatorship, but the EU has completely failed to draw a red line and say “thus far and no further”. I am confident Britain will remain a liberal democracy even if it leaves the EU Hungary and Poland, by contrast, will remain members of the EU but are ceasing to be liberal democracies. In the very countries where, three decades ago, the causes of freedom and Europe advanced so magnificently arm in arm, these causes are now being prised apart by skilful, anti-liberal populists exploiting a longstanding disconnect between the Europe of values and the Europe of money.This problem runs through the history of European integration, with the values being defended by the Council of Europe, its European court of human rights in Strasbourg, and to some extent the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) – whose election monitors criticised Hungary’s running of its recent election. The EU started life as an economic community. For decades now, attempts have been made to reverse-engineer the values back into the economic community. This has worked well in influencing the behaviour of countries aspiring to EU membership, but once a country like Hungary is inside the union, it rapidly finds it can get away with almost anything.What can the EU do? It has applied to Poland an elaborate procedure for addressing “systemic” threats to the rule of law, including proceedings for infringement of the treaties. This has been important symbolically, but largely ineffective. Poland’s own ombudsman, Adam Bodnar, finds that the rule of law has already been seriously undermined, and the constitutional court emasculated. Brussels has been playing chess against a kickboxer. The kickboxer wins.For the first time ever, the EU has activated article 7 of its basic treaty, identifying a serious and persistent breach of fundamental EU values in Poland. Article 7 envisages sanctions, up to and including suspension of voting rights in the union’s internal decision-making, so long as all other member states agree. But they won’t, because Hungary will have Poland’s back and Poland Hungary’s.Increasingly, attention has turned to linking the\u0026nbspmoney countries get from Brussels to respect for the rule of law. In last week’s proposal for the EU’s 2021-27 budget, the European commission has elaborated a remarkable procedure: if there are “generalised deficiencies” in a member state’s legal system, the EU can cut the flow of funds. Since such an action only requires a majority in the European council, Poland and Hungary couldn’t veto it.In addition, the European anti-fraud office and the European public prosecutor are to crack down on corruption in the distribution of EU funds. This matters because a crucial part of east-central European Johnsonism is using EU funds for political patronage, rewarding supportive media owners and other cronies, as well as more straightforward pocket-lining. The outsize, brand new football stadium and barely used single-gauge railway near Orbán’s childhood village of Felscút has become a global symbol of this.The European commission proposals are welcome, but will not begin to bite for several years. We need something with more immediate impact. That something is the expulsion of Orbán’s Fidesz party from the European People’s Party (EPP) before next year’s European elections. The EPP is the EU’s main grouping of centre-right parties. Leading figures from its member parties include German chancellor Angela Merkel, Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy, European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, and European council president Donald Tusk. It emphatically holds high the values of liberal pluralist democracy.What is more, party groupings such as this, with their spitzenkandidaten in European elections, are supposed to be at the heart of the EU’s internal democratisation. Yet it keeps in its ranks a party that is not only dismantling liberal, pluralist democracy at home, but fought its last election on an anti-Brussels, xenophobic platform, including dog-whistle antisemitism in posters plastered across the country targeting George Soros and a fictional “Soros plan” for flooding Hungary with Muslim migrants. The EPP does not merely tolerate Fidesz it actively supports it. As the Fidesz MEP József Szájer noted in an appreciative email to fellow MEPs (leaked to Politico), EPP parliamentary leader Manfred Weber “came … to Budapest to support our campaign, to stand firm beside us”, and party president Joseph Daul “considerably helped us to score this success”.When I make this argument to friends in these centre-right parties, they say:\u0026nbsp“Oh, but it’s still better to have Orbán inside because we can influence him there.” And so they go on\u0026nbspnursing the classic illusions of appeasement, playing\u0026nbspchess against a kickboxer.We don’t have time for this any more. The matter\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspurgent.

Far from being an innocent defence of Enlightenment values, the protest seemed more a Trojan horse for the ideas of the far right to insert themselves into the political mainstream. The demonstration was a response to former EDL leader Tommy Robinson’s permanent ban from Twitter, and featured figures such as Anne Marie Waters, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Gerard Batten of Ukip.I’m not sure that British mainstream politics has quite taken the growing presence of the far right across Europe and the US seriously enough, or indeed the fact that British far-right and socially conservative groups are overtly and deliberately adopting the tactics of their allies across the pond. Claiming freedom of speech as a value is something the American far right has been doing for years (aided and abetted by liberal dupes, naturally) Britain has also recently had an escalation in protests outside abortion clinics. “They are starting to resemble more and more the tactics that you’d see in the United States: graphic imagery, more aggressive approaches to people,” said John Hansen Brevetti, clinical operations manager at a clinic in Ealing, west London.It’s important to understand that these protests aren’t simply inidual opportunistic acts, but part of a growing narrative embraced by social conservatives and the far right that the nation has been corrupted by elites, who are simultaneously destroying the economy and damaging society with their decadent liberal values. These elites, argue these protesters, are censoring ordinary people from expressing reasonable opinions, and forcing women to abort their children when other options might be available. Or as Tommy Robinson put it when he addressed the rally: “The people of this country have been silenced for 20-30 years with the tag of racists. They have managed to silence people so that they are too scared to speak up when they see things that are wrong.”Robinson is tapping into that hoary old Nixonian trope, “the silent majority”. Central to these culture wars, then, is who “the majority” is and which groups can claim to speak for it. No one can claim to have found the perfect oppositional response to the culture wars, but in light of Robinson’s argument, it’s probably a bad idea for the opposition to set itself up as a group that represents only minorities. Instead, perhaps the aim should be to redefine who the majority are, through collective struggle, solidarity and a movement that makes itself welcoming to, and represented by, all demographics in society.Whatever the response to the weekend’s rally is, it can’t come soon enough. Nigel Farage’s triumphalist meetings with Marine Le Pen, the far-right AfD in Germany, and Donald Trump should tell us all that this is a concerted international nationalist project that correctly sees itself as insurgent. And preceding every far-right victory is a political mainstream that didn’t take it seriously enough. Let’s not allow that to happen again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46599382d6ecfc11b2a6cea8e2302be504f1af86/500_422_2974_1784/master/2974.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef940c6fdb76e00ec324ec8b1e37fc6f","title":"peak unicorn bank holiday","story":"First the cats came for the internet, and I did not speak out. Then the meerkats came for advertising, and I did not speak out. Then the unicorns came for, well, pretty damned everything, and now I’m forced to speak out – before these pointy-horned pesky donkeys take over the entire planet.We’ve reached peak unicorn. They’re simply everywhere you look, which for an imaginary creature is remarkable. Some things, such as unicorn toys, and maybe birthday cakes and, at a push, bedding might be occasionally acceptable – for children only. But this nonsense doesn’t end there. Unicorns have infiltrated society more successfully than if the Russian election web fiends and Cambridge Analytica had got together and hatched a plan over a glass or three of gin (unicorn-themed, of course).Unicorns are ubiquitous. There’s a pastel-coloured epidemic of glittery, rainbow, twee awfulness. Fancy an adult-sized unicorn onesie, a shower cap to “keep your hair as perfect as a unicorn’s mane”, light-up unicorn slippers, your own personalised unicorn meme, a unicorn trophy, or even a unicorn outfit for your dog or cat?As for those men and women sporting sparkly T-shirts with that lame trope: “Always be yourself, unless you can be a unicorn, then be a unicorn.” NO! Listen to yourself. Unicorns don’t exist – so you’re basically saying you’re no better than a puff of air (at the same time as sporting an atrocious fashion choice). Just because they are legendary creatures it doesn’t make them legends.What are these mythical monsters anyway? One story says that they existed, but were simply too late to get aboard Noah’s ark when the great flood came. I’d call that lazy. Japan has its own unicorn, called kirin, which is a kind of wild vigilante – rampaging around seeking out baddies and then brutally piercing them through their hearts with their sharp horns. That’s neither sweet nor cuddly. “Always be yourself, unless you can be a unicorn, then be a murderous vigilante” doesn’t have quite the same ring to it.The most likely explanation for this fake folklore-y freak is that someone somewhere with a touch of myopia saw a one-horned, ordinary animal, such as the deer discovered in Italy in 2008, and blew the whole thing out of proportion.So this bank holiday, make a pledge to stand firm in the face of the equine invasion.

If gravity had been slightly weaker, stars would not have exploded into supernovae, a crucial source of many of the heavier elements involved in life. Conversely, if gravity had been slightly stronger, stars would have lived for thousands rather than billions of years, not leaving enough time for biological evolution to take place. This is just one example – there are many others – of the “fine-tuning” of the laws of physics for life.Some philosophers think the fine-tuning is powerful evidence for the existence of God. However, in his 2010 book The Grand Design (co-authored with Leonard Mlodinow), Stephen Hawking defended a naturalistic explanation of fine-tuning in terms of the multiverse hypothesis. According to the multiverse hypothesis, the universe we live in is just one of an enormous, perhaps infinite, number of universes. If there are enough universes then it becomes not so improbable that at least one will chance upon the right laws for life.The problem is that the less variety there is among the universes, the less capable the multiverse hypothesis is of explaining fine-tuning. If there is a huge amount of variation in the laws across the multiverse, it is not so surprising that one of the universes would happen to have fine-tuned laws. But if all of the universes have exactly the same laws – as in Hawking and Hertog’s proposal – the problem returns, as we now need an explanation of why the single set of laws that govern the entire multiverse is fine-tuned.Hertog seems not to agree, arguing that the paper does make progress on fine-tuning: “This paper takes one step towards explaining that mysterious fine-tuning ... It reduces the multiverse down to a more manageable set of universes which all look alike.” However, this merely puts off the explanation of fine-tuning, for the result is that the laws underlying the generation of the multiverse are fine-tuned. We now need to explain not only why our universe is fine-tuned but why every universe is fine-tuned! In terms of explaining the fine-tuning, this is not a step forward but a step back.All is not lost. Hawking was exploring models of the multiverse based on inflationary cosmology, and his paper casts doubt on the potential of this kind of multiverse to explain fine-tuning. But there is another source of scientific support for a multiverse theory: the “many worlds” interpretation of quantum mechanics. While physicists have been exploring inflationary explanations of fine-tuning, philosophers of physics have been exploring quantum mechanical explanations of fine-tuning. If, in the earliest period of our universe, our laws were shaped by the right kind of probabilistic process, the many worlds theory could furnish us with enough variety of laws across the many worlds so as to make it likely that one would be fine-tuned. We don’t yet have evidence that our laws were shaped by such a process. But if the alternative is the postulation of a supernatural creator, then this seems like the more plausible proposal.There is still hope for a scientific account of fine-tuning. However, by ruling out one of the two scientifically credible options for doing this, Hawking and Hertog have slightly strengthened the alternative explanation in terms of God. It is ironic that the atheist Hawking should, in his final contribution to the science, make God’s existence less improbable.• Philip Goff is the author of Consciousness and Fundamental Reality"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1504c3ab093f4a17da9162c219ebb00832ea5d6/0_196_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=960a18239c41b2575229e549b2790dee","title":"get the lowdown on ottawa a local reveals all","story":"Queen Victoria may have picked Ottawa out of obscurity to name it the capital of Canada but the city has grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that loves to embrace the outdoorsWhen Queen Victoria picked Ottawa to be the capital of Canada it was an unimposing frontier town: the city has since grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that’s all about the outdoors.Whatever the weather, Ottawites embrace all four seasons. On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city – the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau – or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival it’s the world’s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers.In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa’s central Rideau canal. The world’s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that’s a pastry, not an animal’s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children’s Snowflake Kingdom.Thanks to it’s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada’s topography.The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada’s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Château Laurier, the historic “castle”, opened as a grand hotel in 1912. Parliament’s central Peace Tower is perfect for a bird’s-eye panorama of the city visit on Wednesdays at noon in summer for free yoga sessions in front of parliament on the lawn. Keep your eyes peeled: you might just see prime minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau joining in.There’s a vibrant restaurant scene in Ottowa. Explore the eclectic cuisine of Canadian Culinary Champion Marc Lepine, the only chef to win the Gold Medal Plates competition twice, at his restaurant Atelier or the innovative Middle Eastern fare of Walid El-Tawel at Fairouz.City neighbourhoods are equally exciting and eminently walkable. ByWard Market is arguably the most vibrant, with more than 120 places to eat and drink in a four-block-by-four-block patch that’s also home to a great selection of shops. Also try Westboro and the Glebe, where you’ll find Lansdowne, a complex with a year-round farmers’ market and a new stadium where you can catch sports events downtown. Ottawa’s museum and gallery scene reflects Canadians’ past and future hopes. Gatineau’s Canadian Museum of History’s Grand Hall with its towering totem poles captures the lasting presence of indigenous cultures, while the museum’s new Canadian History Hall presents the largest and most comprehensive exhibition about Canadian history ever created. In contrast, quirky Bytown Museum reveals the history of Ottawa .

The environmental fashion campaigner, who grew up in Italy, remembers hand washing her sweaters each summer, carefully storing them away, then unpacking them the following winter. She would wear them year after year so she had to look after them. This was before fast, disposable fashion she says, “We did it a different way.”These days, as the founder of Eco-Age, a brand consultancy firm that works with luxury fashion labels on improving their sustainability credentials, and as someone who makes frequent appearances on the red carpet alongside her Oscar-winning husband actor Colin Firth, she has an expanded wardrobe – yet it’s probably not as big as you may imagine. In 2010 Firth came up with the Green Carpet Challenge, using her visibility in front of the world’s media to wear only ethical, sustainable and repurposed fashion, and she’s often photographed repeatedly wearing the same gowns as part of her #30wears pledge.She was a long way from Hollywood’s red carpets last year when she travelled to Tasmania to meet some of Australia’s top merino wool growers and learn about the production of wool. Each year she travels to a different country to learn more about the global supply chain. “You can never replace the real experience of meeting people and seeing things with your own eyes.” Recently she’s visited Bangladesh to meet the garment factory workers and Brazil to meet the leather farmers threatening the Amazon leather.The trip to Tasmania was “facilitated” by Woolmark, the Australian company that promotes the use of merino wool around the world, and her experiences were captured in a short documentary Fashionscapes: Forever Tasmania She says she didn’t know what to expect. “You have images of huge herds of sheep overgrazing and intensively reared and then we ended up in this landscape.” Tasmanian farmers like Matt and Vanessa Dunbabin of Bangor farm, who farm merino sheep, prime beef and prime lamb, and Roderic O’Connor, who runs the wool farm Connorville met with her, and she says she found their careful approach to land conservation and sustainable wool production inspiringThe controversial practice of mulesing is a significant issue for the industry, with international wool buyers pushing farmers to phase it out, not least because of customer concerns. Firth asked the farmers about it, and on camera O’Connor says the industry is looking for solutions, through breeding and by using pain relief. For Firth it remains an ethical dilemma. “It’s not a nice practice but if it is done properly it saves the sheep’s life and a death from hell.”The industry is also seen as having a significant environmental impact thanks to pesticide use, greenhouse gas emissions and, in some cases, overgrazing. The washing, dyeing and treatment of wool can also have an impact. Yet the wool industry is pushing back, saying the life cycle assessment tools often used by the fashion industry don’t measure the full supply chain. Woolmark points out that wool is natural, renewable and biodegradable. Firth was convinced, saying that wool comes out on top when compared to the evils of synthetic fibres, which shed microplastics each time they are washed and are not biodegradable. “If you throw away a wool sweater, it composes in the ground very quickly, and it doesn’t waste microfibres when you wash it.”The day before our interview was the fifth anniversary of the Rana Plaza tragedy, when the collapse of the garment factories killed 1134 workers. Firth recently visited Bangladesh and she was disheartened to see how little has changed for the fast fashion industry. “There are new Bangladeshs every day,” she says. “Today all the big guys have just moved to Ethiopia to produce in a country where there is not even minimum wage so the story repeats itself in terms of the businesses and how they produce.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30fa24ebea2b21ee16fe403caa084534da14a0bd/0_521_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=471021b6e6aac7a897c52b8e714b95f0","title":"good day sunshine what to wear in may in pictures","story":"As the old adage goes, ‘Ne’er cast a clout till May be out’ – here’s how you can transition your look from spring to summer without being caught out by a cold snap"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eafa44176bd7c30910bc46d943163caa8873ef0/32_61_3934_2360/master/3934.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d71f82eab27b8020de080a6bc61471cc","title":"bbc itv and channel 4 in talks to create uk streaming service combat netflix amazon","story":"NBC Universal also believed to be involved in discussions on how to combat Netflix and AmazonThe BBC, Channel 4 and ITV have held discussions about joining forces to create a British streaming service to combat the increasing power of Netflix and Amazon in the UK.The early-stage talks, which are also understood to involve NBC Universal, the US TV and film group that owns the maker of Downton Abbey, are focusing on how the UK’s main broadcasters and makers of top shows can work together to create a streaming rival to the popular and deep-pocketed newcomers that have transformed broadcasting.“All options are open, they are early conversations and no direction is firm yet,” one source with knowledge of the talks said. “But they know a video-on-demand platform play would be a true defence for the UK creative industries.” A second source described it as a “public service broadcaster domestic competitor to Netflix.”Netflix has 8.2m subscribers in the UK and 4.3m British households are signed up to Amazon Prime Video, according to figures from the TV ratings body Barb. The BBC, which has traditionally dominated the UK TV and radio landscape, recently said it risked being overtaken by competitors as viewers move inexorably towards on-demand viewing. The corporation owns the UK’s biggest and most recognisable video service, iPlayer, but has conceded that 16 to 24-year-olds spend more time with Netflix in a week than with all of BBC TV, including iPlayer.The broadcasters understand the strategic benefits of some form of potential tie-up of their catch-up TV and on-demand services, but history says it will be fraught with difficulty.

Previous efforts to balance the commercial and public service remits they follow have proved challenging.The established British broadcasters held similar talks two years ago but in the end only the BBC and ITV managed to hook up to launch a Netflix-style service in the US called BritBox. It was hoped that partners including Channel 4 would come on board for a UK service, but a British launch did not take place.ITV and Channel 4 have since had a string of senior management changes, most notably in appointing new chief executives in Carolyn McCall and Alex Mahon respectively, both of whom are looking hard at the best strategic digital options for the future.It is understood that all options are on the table in the talks, which also included the BBC’s commercial arm, BBC Studios. The corporation has been keen to use the strength of iPlayer as the master brand, which has met resistance from Channel 4 and ITV, which have been driving their services, All 4 and ITV Hub, with increasing success with viewers.Another option might be to revitalise a workable plan to expand BritBox and a third to launch a whole new brand and subscription video-on-demand service.The discussions bear similarities with the ill-fated Project Kangaroo, a video-on-demand service from the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 that was set for launch in 2007 but became tangled in red tape and was ultimately blocked by the competition regulator two years later. Following the watchdog’s ruling, the field was open for foreign rivals to take the front foot, as feared by the broadcasters. Netflix arrived in 2012 and Amazon began its push in earnest with the rebranding of LoveFilm as Prime Video in 2014.Kangaroo, which got as far as briefly appointing the former BBC, Microsoft and Johnston Press boss Ashley Highfield as chief executive, aimed to be an open venture that also allowed TV production companies to join.The then head of the BBC’s commercial arm, John Smith, said at the time that Kangaroo represented broadcasters taking control of our destiny.This time, pay-TV providers, many of whom have a mix of free and pay-TV channels and content, could potentially offer some programming to a new service too. The original Kangaroo model looked to use a mix of free, advertisement-funded and paid-for viewing models.“My understanding is that it is a bit of a dusting off of Kangaroo, which was a good idea that should never have been blocked. Look at where the market is now,” the second source said. “Think of it as Kangaroo-plus. Sort of a public service broadcaster domestic competitor to Netflix, but potentially with the flexibility to be broader than that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2111592d943cf763a97d86287fe7cb8073127a30/70_0_1820_1092/master/1820.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=291480c21e4384520e76895c6878aa6e","title":"barcelona and real madrid explode into life to make the clasico matter","story":"There was supposed to be little to play for but after 28 shots, four goals, a red card and bags of controversy, it didn’t feel like it“Nah, nah, it was quiet,” Marcelo grinned and everyone laughed. A few metres away, through the door to the left, Ernesto Valverde took a seat and came straight out with it. “Decaffeinated,” he said dead pan, the hint of a smirk of his face. There was a bit of a laugh then too. Everyone knew what they meant, the irony not lost on anyone, Valverde’s first word of the week, sent right back at them.Outside, the confetti had settled all around the Camp Nou, billions of bits of colour everywhere, and it was quiet now, midnight approaching and 97,797 people heading home, but still their minds raced and their hearts too, trying to make sense of it all, picking their way through what they’d just seen. “Bloody hell, what a clásico!” Barcelona’s manager said.It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Decaffeinated was the word, but it was wrong. All week, it had been repeated endlessly: Barcelona were champions and double winners already while Real Madrid were preparing for the European Cup final, happy just for no one to get hurt. There was nothing to play for, or so they said, but there was: for Barcelona, history called, the chance to complete a first unbeaten season for 86 years – and back when Madrid did it in 1932 and Athletic Club did it in 1930, there were only 18 games, so you could pretty much call it the first ever. With four matches left, it felt like only Madrid could deny them and they would do all they could. Besides, football tends to find a way, a momentum all of its own, and in a clásico there’s always something to play for.So, they played – the way they so often do in this game, the match that always seems to deliver, even when it’s not supposed to. Set up to be “as exciting as a hospital dinner,” as David Gistau wrote, instead it was very, very tasty. Decaffeinated? Aye, right. “There was plenty of caffeine,” Valverde said. “Caffeine? It was pure taurine,” wrote Marca. They called it “war” and “in war there is no peace,” insisted Manuel Jabois in El País, likening it to “fishing with dynamite”.It was explosive, all right. There were 28 shots, chances at one end then the other, seven yellow cards given and a penalty not given, maybe two. A red card, a goal disallowed, controversy and confrontations everywhere. Sergio Ramos and Luis Suárez, Luka Modric and Jordi Alba, Sergi Roberto and Marcelo. Messi went in on Ramos, the world upside down. There was an argument in the tunnel as they headed off at half-time, Barcelona having just been reduced to 10 men and Messi recriminating the referee, and another one as they headed back out again at the end of it, Nacho shaking his head and muttering “unbelievable” at Gerard Piqué.Which was one word for a night that ended with the players embracing, spent but smiling, the final score 2-2. There were four goals, all of them superb– one each for Suárez, Cristiano Ronaldo, Leo Messi and Gareth Bale – and enough to keep everyone going for weeks, AS suggesting that it bordered on the days of Mourinho v Guardiola. Not least when it came to the thing some of them love best of all: the referee. “It’s a good job there’s no VAR or we’d still be out there,” Valverde joked. In the first half Alejandro Hernández Hernández ruled out a goal from Suárez for offside and sent off Roberto for hitting out at Marcelo in the second he didn’t give a penalty when Marcelo was fouled by Jordi Alba and didn’t blow when Suárez left Raphael Varane on the floor, hooking his ankle as he passed to make the second goal, later admitting: “It was a bit of a foul.” Above all, it was a bit good. “A mad house”, Marca said. “Mucho clásico, not much of a referee,” AS insisted. “Surrealism takes the clásico,” declared El Mundo. “Colossal,” El País’s headline called it, capturing it best. Because for all the controversy there was football too the clásico it lived up to its usual billing again, if not the billing it had been given in the week before. The speed of it, the skill, the quality. The commitment, too. Yes, it was edgy at times, and there were complaints too, but there was also a dignity in the way they competed, as if everything was at stake, not nothing.“It was a great game, with no one worrying about whether there was nothing to play for. Everyone who likes football should be happy, and the football is the most important thing – more than all the controversy some want,” Zidane insisted. The match that “didn’t matter” was tense, open, exhilarating, Ronaldo growing ever more nervous on the bench, players falling and hearts racing, Barcelona withstanding all the way to the finish when Nelson Semedo ed to head clear, safe at last. They might even have won, breaking away to make chances – the “Alamo” in the words of Santi Giménez. Rakitic ran and ran and then when he had finished he ran some more, Semedo shot up the right, and Messi multiplied, Zidane admitting that Madrid had played better against 11 than 10. But a draw would do, the record still alive. “At this point, it would have hurt to have lost that record to anyone,” Valverde admitted. It would have hurt even more to lose it to Madrid. With 10 men, Barcelona resisted, and “to resist is to win,” ran the headline on the front of Sport, missing the opportunity to accurately apply Juan Negrín’s famous – and ultimately flawed – war-time slogan. “Heroic and undefeated,” read the cover of Sport.The end is in sight now. For Andrés Iniesta, especially – and he wanted to hold on to it for as long as he could. Withdrawn after an hour, this was his final meeting with Madrid. “You think it never ends but it’s ending now. These are different games there’s nothing like a clásico and I tried to enjoy it from the first minute. I’ll take it all with me,” he said, a little sadly, standing there in the tunnel, where Zidane stood and waited quietly in the shadows to embrace him.• “Yes, we can!”, sang the Celta fans, precisely because they knew that already-relegated Deportivo can’t – not any more. It was derby day in Galicia and time for them to wind up their rivals, oléing passes, pleading for Depor’s next derby next season to be against their B team and campaigning for Depor striker Lucas Pérez to make it to the Spain squad. Which he won’t, of course, but he did at least get a little revenge with the equaliser.• Something strange happened this weekend: Betis lost, and let in two. Not that it will stop them making it to Europe – although it did confirm that Valencia will be in the Champions League, despite them losing to Villarreal. A superb game at San Mamés, marked by the presentation of the One Club Man award to Carles Puyol and four shots that hit the bar, a couple of them threatening to break it, ended with a 2-0 win for Athletic that carried a hint of what might have been. “This could be a great team,” coach Cuco Ziganda said.

Avocado has had its moment and, while I will always love it, the time has come for something else. This winter in LA (the same temperature as midsummer in the UK), I went to Kismet, a small restaurant on the city’s east side famed for its Californication of Middle Eastern food. The dish du jour? Broccoli toast. I was sceptical. Broccoli, I thought, lacks the requisite creaminess to be a good toast topping. I was wrong. Teamed with a tahini layer and some spice, it was all I could have asked for. Here is my version, plus five more toast toppings. Step aside, avocado.Good toast and leafy stemmed broccoli are key here, although standard (calabrese) broccoli will stand in if you slice it thinly enough. If you are using a grill rather than a griddle pan, be sure to turn the broccoli regularly: the result will be charred, crisped leaves that soften when they cool.400g stem broccoli, purple sprouting or Tenderstem4 tbsp thick Greek yoghurt4 tbsp tahini1 unwaxed lemonSalt and black pepperExtra-virgin olive oil4 slices sourdough100g sunflower seeds, toasted1 tbsp za’atarBoil a large pan of generously salted water, and blanch the broccoli for three to four minutes, until it has lost its rawness but still holds its shape. Drain and set aside.Mix the yoghurt with the tahini, a good squeeze of lemon, some salt and pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil. Taste, and balance with more lemon, salt and pepper as necessary.Heat a griddle pan or grill to maximum and, once hot, char the broccoli on all sides, until the edges crisp. Once you are happy with the broccoli, take it off the heat, then char the toast on both sides using the same griddle or grill.Spread the hot toast with a little olive oil and the tahini yoghurt, then top with the warm, charred broccoli, the toasted seeds and a good pinch of za’atar.Here are a further five toast toppings that just might supersede standard avo toast. None takes more than 10 minutes to make.Radish, butter and mint Mix a little butter with flaky salt and spread on toast as thickly as you dare. Top with sliced radishes, their leaves and some torn mint leaves.Peas and preserved lemonMash or blitz cooked peas with olive oil, Turkish chilli pepper flakes (or dried red chilli) and the chopped rind of a preserved lemon. Top the toast with feta and then the pea mixture.Avocado on toast, reinventedMash an avocado with a squeeze of lemon juice, a teaspoon of red-wine vinegar, a teaspoon of grainy mustard and half a teaspoon of honey or maple syrup, then stir in some chopped dill, season and pile on to toast.Soft egg and Persian cucumberBoil an egg for six and a half minutes, then cool under cold running water, peel and slice. Top the toast with egg, olive oil, slices of cucumber, chopped capers and cornichons, a few chopped soft herbs and some lemon zest.Ricotta, strawberries and basilSlice a spring onion, squeeze half a lemon over it, then set aside.

It’s a situation that exposes the true complexity of the #MeToo conversationThis is where #MeToo gets really messy: when a venerated man who has publicly revealed he was abused is, in turn, accused of being an abuser. Where should our sympathies lie? It need not be a question of belief. It’s possible to believe simultaneously that Díaz was sexually abused as a child, that he thinks about “the hurt I caused”, as he writes, and that the women who accuse him are telling the truth. All of this is part of the #MeToo conversation. None of it should be discounted. And it is possible for a man to be both a victim and abuser. In fact, empathising with Díaz for the trauma he courageously describes while holding him to account for any destructive and misogynistic behaviour might be the best way to understand and, hopefully, break the cycle of abuse.Some have claimed Díaz’s piece served a darker purpose. Clemmons described it as “self-serving”. For Roxane Gay it was a “pre-emptive move” aimed at garnering sympathy when accusations came to light. Yet the piece is both confession and mea culpa. As the title signals, it is about “the legacy of childhood trauma”. Díaz’s words don’t shy away from any pain he has caused, though they do contextualise it. Whether that’s enough is another matter. How he goes forward counts, too. So far, Díaz has withdrawn from a festival and released a statement claiming he takes responsibility for his past. The paradox of #MeToo playing out so relentlessly in the public arena is that its inherently private reality is what really counts: how we behave in all those daily, intimate and incremental ways.What this is really about is the pernicious power of silence, and how disastrous the burial of trauma is for everyone, especially women. As Audre Lorde wrote: “Your silence will not protect you.” Which is why we must keep talking. And listening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8875b37c7868bcb0e835bb5c3c27b0cc1d232c01/0_202_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f58b2b8450bbbc2b9e3ef24010d11bc","title":"going underground the subterranean secrets of londons super rich","story":"Study exposes thousands of opulent basement schemes with cinemas, pools … and a beachThe subterranean secrets of London’s super-rich are revealed in a study of 4,650 basements granted planning permission in some of the capital’s most affluent neighbourhoods, with hundreds of swimming pools and cinemas in the most luxurious developments.Almost 1,000 gyms, 376 pools, 456 cinemas, 381 wine stores and cellars and 115 staff rooms, including bedrooms for nannies and au pairs, were found in the plans for the basements approved by seven London boroughs between 2008 and 2017.The data, collected by Newcastle University’s global urban research unit from planning applications, identified two basements with more than one pool, including one with an artificial beach.The study, Mapping Subterranean London: the Hidden Geography of Residential Basement Developments, maps their proliferation in Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Camden, Islington and Wandsworth. The researchers calculated that the combined depth of all of the schemes would be 15,289 metres, almost 50 times the height of the Shard.The study only covers the basements granted planning consent under existing properties. Other basements have been constructed under new homes. One new mansion in Notting Hill, on sale for £25m, includes a double-level basement with a 21-metre swimming pool.The researchers do not know how many of the basements they found have been built, because current planning law allows owners to commence work up to three years after permission is granted, with no deadline to complete. Several leading basement architects and developers said, however, that the vast majority of approved projects are completed.Other amenities uncovered in the research include 547 media rooms, 340 games and recreation rooms, 242 saunas or steam rooms, 63 underground garages and parking facilities, and one car museum. The study, undertaken for the , classified the basements into three size categories. Standard developments, of a single storey under the footprint of the house, made up four in five of the schemes. Their amenities were generally utilitarian, often containing extra living or utility rooms.The researchers also identified 785 large basements, of at least two storeys under the footprint of the house, or one storey extending well under the garden. Most were large enough to house a swimming pool.Another 112 basements were classified as mega, of at least three storeys in depth under the footprint of the house or two storeys in depth and extended under the garden. Some of the largest were up to 18 metres deep and bigger than the rest of the property above ground, warranting the nickname of iceberg homes.The most extravagant schemes include a three-storey basement in Holland Park, Kensington and Chelsea, with amenities including a swimming pool, plunge pool, beach, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi, media room, gym and staff quarters. A three-storey scheme in Mayfair, Westminster, which was granted planning permission under an existing basement, features a swimming pool, cinema, car park, sauna, steam room and dance floor. A single-storey basement in Primrose Hill, Camden, includes a Turkish bath, Roman bath, cigar room, swimming pool, plunge pool, sauna, massage room, cinema, games room and bar, wine store, pilates room, gym and banquet hall.Roger Burrows, professor of cities at Newcastle University, said: “In many areas of ‘super prime’ London planning restrictions often makes it impossible to extend properties laterally or add floors on top. Consequently residential basement developments in the wealthiest parts of London have increased markedly.”The study shows how the size and splendour of basements varies across the seven boroughs. Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster, the wealthiest boroughs surveyed, have the highest number of swimming pools.In contrast, the researchers found only three mega basements in Hammersmith and Fulham, and none in Haringey, Islington or Wandsworth.The Kensington and Chelsea MP, Emma Dent Coad, said the local council had once approved a three-level basement with a ing board. “I have sympathy for people who need more space for an expanding family, but building a beach under your mansion when you’re hardly going to be there is something else entirely,” she said. “While we have people sleeping on the streets we really have to look at what we’re doing in our borough because that is bad planning.”The streets with the highest numbers of basements granted planning permission include Tregunter Road in Chelsea with 22 and Hamilton Terrace in St John’s Wood with 16. Some of the latter basements extend to properties on the adjacent Hamilton Close.Sir Hugh Cortazzi, a former British ambassador to Japan, and his wife Elizabeth, who live on Hamilton Close, said the number of excavations under houses on the mews in the past decade had blighted their lives.“It’s depressing,” he said. “We’ve had huge dumper trucks blocking the mews. There’s still work going on. I fear the demand will go on and on.” Karen Buck, the MP for Westminster North, who has campaigned for tighter restrictions on basement developments, said: “The sheer opulence of many of the larger basement excavations caused jaws to drop even in fairly affluent neighbourhoods like St John’s Wood and Bayswater, where neighbours have sometimes found themselves under siege from these developments. And it wasn’t uncommon to be told that the building was scarcely occupied at the end.”The study found that council policies introduced to restrict the size of basement developments had led to a downturn in applications in recent years, but the researchers added that the numbers being granted approval in the past two years were similar to those in 2008-12, only now there were fewer mega-basements."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e58b9c3e877741102a73ee6708bdafb0787a0439/0_84_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab19e08f0a61fb8c67429eec51ce308e","title":"love supreme at the roundhouse review adventurous engaging minifest","story":"Roundhouse, LondonBrooklyn trio Moon Hooch, with their dupstep basslines and a starring role for a traffic cone, were the most interesting act on a varied and impressive billLove Supreme, Britain’s big jazz and soul festival, has been running since 2013 in the lush gardens of Glynde Place and now attracts crowds of more than 40,000 each summer. To celebrate its fifth anniversary, and to preview next month’s festival, its organisers assembled this budget-priced mini-festival in Camden’s Roundhouse.With so many jazz heavyweights already booked for this weekend’s Cheltenham jazz festival, this bill’s headline acts erred towards the poppier end of things. Keyboard player Cory Henry is the most engaging figure to emerge from the bafflingly popular New York fusion outfit Snarky Puppy, and he certainly has a charisma that’s rare for a keyboardist – a freewheeling, stage-hogging extroversion that’s reminiscent of Beastie Boys’ organist Money Mark. What he lacks is material. Covers of songs by Prince, James Brown and the Bee Gees each feature some fine pitchwheel-heavy solos from Henry and fellow synth twiddler Nick Semrad, but the band’s dense, airless funk-rock doesn’t really give anyone space to breathe.Conversely, the main headliner, Mr Jukes, had plenty of fine tunes but could do with a fraction of Henry’s stage presence. Many of us were shocked when the first album by this AvalanchesGorillaz-style R\u0026ampB project, God First (led by Jack Steadman, the singer of the distinctly average Bombay Bicycle Club), turned out to be rather good, and the standout tracks (Angels, Grant Green, Leap of Faith, From Golden Stars Comes Silver Dew) sound tremendous, as do the Wayne Shorter, Roy Hargrove and Lauren Hill covers. Unfortunately, the onstage optics – eight competent session musicians centred around the catastrophically unengaging Steadman on bass – let daylight in on the magic.Some of the most interesting music appeared on the minor stages, tucked away in small spaces around the Roundhouse complex. The downstairs Seckler Stage only holds around a hundred bodies and became absolutely rammed at times, not least for a rare appearance by the revered British saxophonist Steve Williamson. His intense modal improvisations feature tricksy Afro-Latin rhythms, superbly negotiated by the remarkable 16-year-old drummer Zoe Pascal. The room also hosted the poetic modal jazz of pianistsinger Joy Ellis (featuring the excellent Rob Luft on guitar) and singerguitarist Oscar Jerome (playing wonderfully odd R\u0026ampB tunes and putting his guitar through some strange, goth-style FX).An outside stage on the sunny first-floor terrace seemed to specialise in what has become a contemporary London micro-genre – the jazz musician duetting with a knob-twiddling DJproducer. South Londoners Joe Armon-Jones and Maxwell Owin mix spacey modal jazz piano solos with abstract samples. North Londoners Blue Lab Beats mix the Dilla-style loops of troll-haired DJ Namali Kwaten with the smooth-jazz solos of left-handed pianistguitaristbassist David Mrakpor. East London’s Soccer96 ply a punkier kind of rave, featuring drummer Max “Betamax” Hallett. All three acts benefit from outside intervention: when Soccer96 invited a shouty poet and saxophonist on stage, it sounded gloriously like Ornette Coleman joining Sleaford Mods.This spirit of adventure leaked on to the main Roundhouse stage with Brooklyn trio Moon Hooch, an unholy racket featuring tenor sax, baritone sax and drums. Their 45-minute set incorporated dubstep basslines, circular-breathing solos and a starring role for a three-foot traffic cone (inserted into the bell of Wenzl McGowen’s baritone sax). It’s a mix of high theatre and intense improvisation operating without a safety net, and was the most interesting act on this varied but impressive bill.• Love Supreme is at Glynde Place, East Sussex, 29 June-1 July.

It’s more that the Brown brothers and their producer Mike Will Made-It have suggested that it’s an improvement on SpeakerboxxxThe Love Below. In addition to two solo albums, Swae Lee’s Swaecation and Slim Jxmmi’s Jmxtro, it also features a collaborative effort: “Outkast fans, we still waiting on that, the next project with both of them together,” said their producer, clearly no great fan of Outkast’s admittedly flawed but undoubtedly collaborative 2006 follow-up Idlewild.Rae Sremmurd ide up along roughly Outkast-ish lines, with Swae Lee in the Andre 3000 role as a kind of romantic, psychedelic star-child, as given to crooning as he is to rapping – the cover of SR3MM features him with a rose between his teeth and arms filled with cuddly toys – and Slim Jxmmi the keeper of the hip-hop flame in Big Boi mode. The music on Swaecation accordingly tends towards the spacey and lovelorn – waves crash, guitars jangle, everything is drenched in echo and Lost Angels sounds not unlike the hazy, hypnagogic synthpop of Washed Out – and the words follow suit: “Colours burst and all I see are shapes, sun goes away and that’s when I call your name.” Jmxtro, meanwhile cleaves to a more straightforward, sparse trap blueprint, and the lyrical concerns are noticeably more earthy: “I’mma go fuck with the strippers tonight.”The problem with the Outkast comparison is that SpeakerboxxxThe Love Below was one of those rare occasions when an artist maxes out the capacity of two CDs without longueurs or recourse to filler – it had to be two-and-a-half hours long to accommodate the duo’s multiplicity of musical ideas, which stirred everything from trad jazz to drum’n’bass to 60s sunshine pop into the mix. Once Rae Sremmurd have established their two distinct personas, they’re set: their respective albums continue in the vein the opening tracks establish without really throwing any curveballs (a bizarre appearance by Pharrell Williams notwithstanding, singing in an eerie, alien falsetto on Jmxtro’s Chanel). That isn’t to say that what’s here isn’t good: it’s frequently very good indeed. The emo future-R\u0026ampB songs on Swaecation are lush with melodies, while Jmxto’s Mike Will Made-It authored beats are impressively tough, not least the electrifying Brxnks Truck and the swooping bassline of Keep God First. It’s just that the grandness of the presentation slightly oversells the contents. Neither of the albums are as epic a statement as the concept suggests, and the best tracks from each could happily live side by side on a single album. A similar desire for grandiosity also slightly undermines the collaborative album SR3MM. Brevity is currently having a moment in hip-hop – hotly-tipped Chicago rapper Valee’s tracks frequently clock in at under two minutes – and it’s certainly Rae Sremmund’s friend: good with tunes, but not big on lyrical depth or spellbinding storytelling, their music works best when it hits you with its hooks, then scarpers quickly. Take Close: concise and taut, based around a sinister keyboard figure and blessed with a surprisingly relaxed verse from Travis Scott, it is teeming with ideas. When it hangs around for five minutes – as on Bedtime Stories or Up in My Cocina – their talent is spread thin, and things become too repetitious for their own good. The former in particular is a really great track, complete with a guest appearance by the Weeknd, that loses its force the longer it lasts. Still, at least album highlight Powerglide justifies its five-minute length, by dint of being equipped with a fantastic, propulsive sample sourced from Side 2 Side, a 2009 single by Three 6 Mafia (whose Juicy J makes a cameo appearance) and a chorus so brilliant and addictive it’s impossible to hear it enough times. It’s followed by Rock N Roll Hall of Fame, a track in the mode of the Mannequin Challenge-soundtracking 2016 hit Black Beatles, the bragging undercut by oddly mournful music, a vague hint of hurt in the lyrics about the way Rae Sremmurd were initially received: “I’m feeling pain, but I don’t know how to show it … put a little hit on the charts and they know it.” Mocked from the start as shallow, an accusation that’s never quite left them no matter how many platinum singles they make, you can understand why Rae Sremmund might want to make an ostentatious artistic statement. The result is a decent triple album, but it would have been better yet boiled down to an eclectic single album, the best solo tracks sitting alongside the group efforts: not so much reining ambitions in as realising less is sometimes more.

Figures for the value of the global meat industry vary wildly from $90bn to as much as $741bn. What about its cultural and social importance?Cooked meat may have been partially responsible for the large brains that characterise Homo sapiens and have put humans where we are now. Cooking made calories from meat (and from vegetables) easier to consume and absorb than in a raw form. And the domestication of certain animals – along with the domestication of wild grains and vegetables – marked the beginning of human agricultural history in the “fertile crescent”. Throughout human history the hunting and farming of meat has been part of our stories and mythologies and some of our legal and religious systems the fatted calf for the prodigal son the medieval forest laws that created areas where no one but English royalty could hunt the sacrifical sheep to mark the beginning of Eid Al-Adha even the roasted wild boars consumed at the end of every adventure by Asterix and Obelix. But is meat still crucial to human life? Some argue that, just because we’ve always eaten meat, that doesn’t mean we always have to. If we can get all the dietary nutrients and protein that we need elsewhere, should we? The old-fashioned vision of a mixed farm with wheat and chickens and pigs still exists. More than half of the farms in the US, for example, were small enough in 2012 to have sales of less than $10,000 dollars. But the 20th century saw the application of the principles of the industrial revolution to agriculture - how could inputs be minimised and profits be maximised?  The result was the factory farm, first for chickens, then pigs, and more recently cattle. Producers discovered that animals could be kept inside, and fed grain, and could be bred to grow more quickly and get fatter in the right places. Since 1925, the average days to market for a US chicken has been reduced from 112 to 48, while its weight has ballooned from a market weight of 2.5 pounds to 6.2. Pig and cattle farming has followed suit. Sows are held in gestation crates for up to four weeks once they are pregnant, and then put into farrowing crates once they’ve had their piglets to prevent them accidentally crushing their young. Industrially reared pigs spend their lives in indoor pens. Cattle farming is now being similarly streamlined, with cows in the last few months of their lives being fattened in feedlots with no access to grass and sometimes no shelter.What is the environmental impact of our current farming model? It is extremely difficult to separate out the different impacts of different farming models and types. Many measurements look at agricultural impact without making a distinction between arable v livestock, or industrial v small farms. However, the following information begins to indicate the scale of the problem. An influential study in 2010 of the water footprints for meat estimated that while vegetables had a footprint of about 322 litres per kg, and fruits drank up 962, meat was far more thirsty: chicken came in at 4,325lkg, pork at 5,988lkg, sheepgoat meat at 8,763lkg, and beef at a stupendous 15,415lkg. Some non-meat products were also pretty eye-watering: nuts came in at 9,063lkg.  Farms contribute to water pollution in a range of ways: some of those are associated more closely with arable farming, and some with livestock, but it’s worth remembering that one-third of the world’s grain is now fed to animals. The FAO believes that the livestock sector, which is growing and intensifying faster than crop production, has “serious implications” for water quality.  The types of water pollution include: nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilisers and animal excreta) pesticides sediment organic matter (oxygen demanding substances such as plant matter and livestock excreta) pathogens (E coli etc) metals (selenium etc) and emerging pollutants (drug residues, hormones and feed additives).  The impacts are wide-reaching. Eutrophication is caused by excesses of nutrients and organic matter (animal faeces, leftover feed and crop residues) – which cause algae and plants to grow excessively and use up all the oxygen in the body of wate at the expense of other species. A review in 2015 identified 415 coastal bodies already suffering these problems. Pesticide pollution can kill weeds and insects away from the agricultural area, with impacts that may be felt all the way up the food chain. And although scientists do not yet have full data on the connection between antibiotic use in animals and rising levels of antibiotic resistance in the human population, water pollution by antibiotics (which continue to have an active life even after going through the animal and into the water) is definitely in the frame. It’s hard to work out exactly what quantity of greenhouse gases (GHG) is emitted by the meat industry from farm to fork carbon emissions are not officially counted along entire chains in that way, and so a number of complicated studies and calculations have attempted to fill the gap.What about the giant companies that dominate the sector? A 2017 landmark studyfound that the top three meat firms – JBS, Cargill and Tyson – emitted more greenhouse gases in 2016 than all of France.  Some argue that veganism is the only sane way forward. A study last year showed, for example, that if all Americans substituted beans for beef, the country would be close to meeting the greenhouse gas goals agreed by Barack Obama. The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation has a huge collection of data, and has also published some crucial reports on this issue, including the groundbreaking Livestock’s long shadow.Some institutions doing interesting research include Sustain The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy Brighter Green Sustainable Food Trust IPES-food.

Nearly 30 other party members have backed the call.Lewis is a frontbench Treasury spokesman on the left of the party, and Cruddas, a former aide to Tony Blair, has been a leading thinker in the party for most of the past decade. The campaign for a progressive alliance reached a peak two years ago when MP Lisa Nandy launched Labour Together in a bid to pull the party’s warring wings back together. The organisation now appears to be moribund with no recent activity on either its website or Twitter feed.But Neal Lawson, who chairs the pressure group Compass, which campaigns for a progressive alliance, argues that cooperation with other progressive parties at last Thursday’s local elections could have tipped the balance in close-fought councils.In the south London borough of Wandsworth, Labour came within a handful of votes of toppling the Conservatives. The Tories lost eight councillors, leaving Labour just seven seats away from what could have been a defining result for the party.Campaigners also point to the Liberal Democrats’ victory in Richmond, where, with the Greens, they gained a total of 28 seats to win the council back for the first time since 2006. In their letter, Cruddas and Lewis argue that a progressive alliance could have delivered as many as 60 seats for Labour at last year’s general election. That would have given Jeremy Corbyn a working majority in the Commons. But Labour has long rejected all local arrangements with other parties. The three members in Hunt’s South West Surrey constituency who were expelled last year – Steve Williams, Kate Townsend and Robert Park – were not alone. In Hastings, a Labour party member, Nicholas Wilson, who campaigned against Amber Rudd on an anti-corruption ticket, was also expelled. He won more votes than Labour needed to unseat the former home secretary, who had a majority of 346.Lawson said: “Politics in Britain is in a stalemate. Labour must give local parties the ability to negotiate progressive alliances as the best way to break the stalemate it worked in 2017 and again in the local elections last week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbed300bd8c9c2d798bb094a12e5e0e2984b29ae/116_0_4031_2420/master/4031.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=954bc9110785cbddc10eb30320f9f5d1 1300w","title":"did you solve it im a mathematician get me out of here","story":"The solution to today’s escapology problemIn my puzzle blog earlier today I set you the following puzzle:Imagine you are in a grid 100 squares long and 100 squares wide. (The grid is fixed to the compass directions: updown is NS, and leftright is WE.) On each square of the grid, there’s an arrow. Each arrow is pointing either N, S, W or E.Choose any square. That’s your starting position. Now the game begins.The rules are that you must always follow the arrow. So, if the arrow in your starting square points N, you move to the square due north. If the arrow points E, you move to the square due east.But there is an extra thing you need to do. Once you arrive in a new square, you must rotate the arrow in the square you came from by 90 degrees clockwise. So if the square you came from pointed N, then once you leave that square you must rotate that arrow to E. If the square you came from pointed E, once you leave that square you must rotate that arrow to S.Safely in your new square, you repeat the process: follow the arrow to a new square, and then rotate the arrow in the square you came from by 90 degrees clockwise.If you are in a square on the top edge and the arrow points north, then the following move you are going to get out the grid. Hurrah! You win! Likewise if you are on any of the other edge squares of the grid, and the arrow in the square points out, you get out.But if you are not on an edge, you will probably start roaming around the grid. Here’s a statement:“No matter which directions the arrows are pointing at the start, and no matter which square you choose to begin, you will always eventually get OUT OF THE GRID”True or false? Prove it one way or the other.TRUE! You will always get out of the grid.What is lovely about this puzzle is that there is a very elegant way to solve it. You do NOT need to make any complicated calculations about combinations. To start, let’s assume the statement is false. In other words, let’s suppose that you never get out of the grid. You roam around the grid forever. Since there are a finite number (10,000) of squares in the grid but during your eternal roam you are making an infinite number of steps, then you will start repeating squares and eventually there will be a square that you visit an infinite number of times. Let’s call this square A.After each time you visit A, the arrow in A turns by 90 degrees clockwise. After four visits to A, its arrow will have pointed to each of the four compass directions, meaning that after those four visits you will have moved out into each of the four squares horizontally and vertically adjacent to A.But since you are visiting A an infinite number of times, you must also visit the four squares horizontally and vertically adjacent to A an infinite number of times. And using the same logic, as above, you must also visit the squares that are vertically and horizontally adjacent to these squares an infinite number of times, and the ones adjacent to these ones, and so on. Eventually you will visit a square on an edge.The arrow in this edge square might be pointing out the grid, in which case you get out the grid. If it is not, you know you will return to this square, since we said above that you will visit the square that pointed to it an infinite number of times. On the second visit the arrow is rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Either it points out, in which case you get out the grid, or it doesn’t, in which case you will return to it a third time, when it is rotated by another 90 degrees. Again, either it points out, or you return for the fourth time, when it must be pointing out, since all the four possible compass directions have been covered. You MUST eventually get out the grid! We started by assuming that you CANNOT get out the grid, and this led us to the conclusion out that you CAN get out the grid. So the assumption that you cannot get out the grid is false...meaning that you can always get out the grid. The statement in the question is TRUE!I hope you enjoyed today’s puzzle.

Somerset now 113 for 2 -no make that 3 - Davies now pushing forward gets an inside edge straight to short leg in the same over. c Croft b Parkinson 54. And a sixth for Virdi! 6-105, Barnard c and b for 66. Worcestershire 526 all out, lead by 92. A good chance for Stoneman to iron out the anxieties and pocket some easy runs this afternoon. This Old Trafford pitch really does look bootiful to bat on. Last week Glenn Chapple said that it was the best pitch in the country - not sure anyone here would disagree. It is a darn shame Hameed hasn’t been here to score some juicy runs on it in the sun, but in the game he played for Fornby against Wallasey on Saturday he made just 5 (1 x 4).

Somerset 51 for 2Good morning from a serene Old Trafford on a beautiful Bank Holiday Monday. Hope you had a wonderful weekend –it was glorious at Hartington YHA - with some enthralling little contests to dip in and out of on the field too.The gateman here told me that I’d missed a wonderful innings from Dane Vilas - first double century by a Lancashire wicketkeeper -and a hardworking one by Keaton Jennings. Looks to be a draw here unless Lancashire can make a quick breakthrough on a wonderful batting strip - no wickets yet for James Anderson, who has beaten the bat now and then but looks a little match-weary as if the old body could do with a drop of oil in the joints and some nip in the shoes.Elsewhere, there were centuries for Joe Clarke, Nick Gubbins and Dawid Malan (first Test player to a hundred this season) and six wickets for Steve Patterson to skittle champions Essex in the thriller at Chelmsford. Baring surprises, the games to keep an eye on today are at Hove and Trent Bridge.Notts v Hampshire Notts 302 \u0026amp 389 for 9 dec, Hants 223 and 111 for 3 Hampshire need 358 to beat Notts.Essex v Yorkshire Yorkshire (50 \u0026amp 329) beat Essex (142 \u0026amp 146) by 91 runsSurrey v Worcestershire Surrey 434, Worcestershire 469 for 6 are 35 runs aheadLancashire v Somerset Somerset 429 and 51 for 0, Lancashire 492.

The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5325058944c25af852069a5acc8c75f527c375c9/0_43_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0895e1345e570bb0fc1cc556db4c851a","title":"qatar blockade unexpected new vision isolation","story":"Enforced isolation has given the emirate confidence to pursue a political and cultural rebootFor most of the past year the city-state of Qatar, the wealthiest peninsula on the planet, has been exploring the law of unintended consequences. The trigger for that came last June, when Qatar’s closest neighbours, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE, escalated a simmering disquiet about the Gulf state’s role in the region to implement a full land and air blockade.Overnight, planes and cargo ships heading for Qatar were erted, all diplomatic links were cut and Qatar’s sole land border, with Saudi Arabia, was closed. Even camels were not spared the politics – 12,000 Qatari animals were forcibly repatriated.The stated aim for the blockade – which came with a 10-day ultimatum of 13 unlikely demands – was a protest against what was seen as Qatar’s singular role in “funding terrorism” (the Saudi line that Donald Trump swallowed and retweeted whole). Politically, it seemed rather an attempt to humiliate the sheikhdom and call it to heel. In the event, something like the opposite of that expectation has unfolded.Far from destabilising Qatar’s ruling al-Thani family, resistance to the ultimatum has lent it an “us against the world” authority. Among the 313,000 native Qataris (in a population of 2.6 million) a cult of personality has grown around the youthful emir, Sheikh Tamim, whose idealised portrait now gazes across the Gulf from the steel and glass skyscrapers of Doha, and is almost ubiquitous in the back window of the 4x4s that cruise the capital’s six-lane corniche.Isolation has also, it seems, acted as a catalyst to Qatar’s long-term vision for itself. One of the inbuilt ironies of the richest per capita state on earth was that, ever since it discovered and exploited its vast natural gas reserves, there has been little native necessity to drive invention. The al-Thanis’ stated goal has been to create a erse knowledge economy that lasts beyond the gas reserves. As Sheikha Hind, younger sister of the emir, explained to me in Doha last week in a rare interview, money – and the incentive of capital projects such as the 2022 World Cup – solves only some of those skills shortages.“It is not a secret that we are a wealthy society and that maybe nobody even needs to work,” she said. “But knowing that you can contribute in developing your country, and allow it to become even more prominent, is something everyone feels pride in. If anything, the blockade helped that. We see a big opportunity to be self-sustainable.”Qatar’s modern nation-building aspirations were first expressed by Sheikha Hind’s parents. While her father developed the partnership with Iran that could exploit the natural gas fields, her mother, Sheikha Moza, established the multibillion-dollar Qatar Foundation in order to transform education, particularly for women. Sheikha Hind, 34, a mother of five herself, was one of the first beneficiaries of “Education City” and has for the past three years been chief executive of the Qatar Foundation.From the balcony of its offices you can see the glass and marble evidence of that ambition in the futuristic campuses of a dozen “partner universities” that radiate outward. Each was persuaded here for its particular expertise in building capacity that Qataris need: Georgetown for its programme in government, Texas A\u0026ampM for engineering, and so on.The newest addition to Education City is the stunning Qatari National Library, designed by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas: a huge, welcoming building in which book stacks rise all around a central area that includes an open theatre and cafe, like terraces on backlit hillsides. There has been no library tradition in the Gulf, so Koolhaas’s idea was to create a space that is immediately understandable. Fifty-one thousand Qataris have already taken membership and the children’s library has proved particularly successful. In the few months since opening, every one of the 150,000 books on its shelves has been borrowed at least once.Along with those silver terraces of books, at subterranean level, in what look like excavated catacombs made of Iranian marble, the library houses an expensively acquired collection of rare manuscripts and calligraphy relating to the Arab world. This collection has been assembled in the same acquisitive spirit in which the al-Thani billions have filled its IM Pei-designed Museum of Islamic Art: to establish Doha as the modern intellectual capital of the Arab world. Later this year a new National Museum, shaped as a series of giant intersecting discs, designed by Jean Nouvel, will add another dimension to that claim.There is a blatant “look at us” attitude in some of this, but also the message that the territory that Qatar aims to colonise is as much cultural as economic. The al-Thanis have made headlines buying blingy stakes in such global landmarks as the Empire State Building, Harrods and the Shard – and splashing out ostentatiously on the world’s most expensive paintings ($250m for Cezanne’s The Card Players) and footballers ($262m to bring superstar Neymar to Qatari-owned Paris St Germain). But they have also long realised that it is whoever controls the story who generally wields power.That principle was first tested 22 years ago when the then emir established and funded the Arab broadcaster al-Jazeera. The harsh journalistic light the television station has shone on the internal politics of other Arab nations (and the relatively soft focus it gives to Qatar) is at the heart of the current enmity and blockade. One of the 13 ultimatum demands of the blockaders was that the broadcaster be shut down.The Saudi-led outrage at al-Jazeera’s reporting and editorial stance deepened during the Arab spring, when the station (and Doha’s ruling family) threw its support behind the popular uprising, rather than the established ruling powers. This stance was seen as part of a wider pattern in which Qatar seeks to build power at home while fomenting dissent abroad, aiming to be all things to all people: keeping trade and diplomatic channels open to Israel while openly funding Hamas hosting the major American air base, al-Udeid, while giving support to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood offering to broker peace talks on Syria while giving refuge to known al-Qaida affiliates.The dean, Everette E Dennis, a distinguished observer of the fourth estate’s role in extending civil society in the former eastern bloc as well as in the US, had expected a fight over censorship when he came to Doha. He has found, he says, that “there has never been a single intrusion into what we teach and how we teach it – the full range of social issues that would be part of the conversation on an American campus are freely discussed here”.Initially, he found some unwillingness to challenge authority among the students,who come from across the region and beyond, but that quickly dissipated. He suggests that the gains of regular press freedoms have begun to be appreciated in Qatar (despite the fact that, since 2016, the authorities have blocked Doha News, an online outlet that offered more critical reporting of their actions).There has been learning on both sides, he suggests. The university has established the first system of press accreditation, for example, and lobbying from graduates of the programme has coincided with the establishment of a properly functioning government information office. That spirit of critical enquiry, he suggests, has also prompted the ruling family and its government to address international concerns, in particular over the shameful treatment of migrant labour in Qatar on capital projects for the World Cup. They have responded to concerns with a minimum wage and new policy over housing programmes and healthcare that have been given a qualified welcome by the International Labour Organisation of the UN.In the dean’s view the blockade has again accelerated this transparency. At the same time as it has become illegal in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE for citizens to question or criticise even the idea of the blockade, Qatar is lifting visa restrictions and attempting to brand itself as a home of greater free speech. While Saudi Arabia congratulates itself on finally allowing women to drive, Sheikha Hind can point to a majority of female undergraduates across all departments, including engineering, at Education City.In that sense, I wonder if the Qatari ruling family is secretly grateful for the blockade in sharpening a perceived cultural ide between itself and its Wahhabi neighbours. Has it proved more an opportunity than a crisis?“I won’t lie to you and tell you we are OK with the blockade,” Sheikha Hind says, “absolutely not. We have had students here who are terribly affected by it – whole families have been torn apart. It is a sad situation we are in.” She hopes, along with every other Qatari I speak to, that there is a resolution to the conflict soon. Still, she says, “if anything, the push we always had here for self-sustainability is just exploding now.” The goal has not changed, she suggests, “but now we are running rather than walking”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc9ae6b7ea3f3575fd8345ddc53acdc54241e076/0_94_4004_2402/master/4004.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=604caba4d7f3e646436e058ec775b4ea","title":"vladimir putin russian president sworn in fourth term kremlin ceremony","story":"Russian president promises to serve people faithfully amid tensions with west and domestic discontent over povertyVladimir Putin has been sworn in for a fourth presidential term in a lavish Kremlin ceremony as tensions with the west rise and domestic discontent over poverty and wealth inequality simmers.State television began its live coverage of the inauguration on Monday with Putin, 65, apparently hard at work in his Kremlin office. He then walked down a long, red-carpeted corridor to a black limousine that whisked him to the nearby Grand Kremlin Palace, the former throne room of Russia’s tsars.Putin was applauded by about 5,000 guests as he entered the palace’s ornately decorated Andreyevsky Hall through colossal doors flanked by Kremlin guards. Among the guests were Gerhard Schröder, the former German chancellor, Steven Seagal, the former Hollywood action star who has become close to Russia’s political elite, and Alexander Zaldostanov, the leather-clad, tattooed leader of a pro-Putin motorcycle club.With his hand on a gold-embossed copy of the Russian constitution, Putin swore to serve the Russian people faithfully. He also hailed Moscow’s ability to stand up for it interests in the international arena, and what he called Russia’s traditional values.Despite the pomp, the ceremony was relatively low key compared with Putin’s return to the Kremlin in 2012, when his black motorcade sped through deserted streets that had been cleared of residents by heavy-handed security forces. A Kremlin banquet to mark the inauguration was reportedly scrapped over fears it would lead to public criticism. Barring a change to the constitution, Putin’s fourth term is likely to be his last as president. He recently laughed off suggestions that he could return to the Kremlin in 2030, when he will be eligible to stand again. Government officials have not discussed the issue of his successor publicly, and analysts say the issue is taboo within the Kremlin walls.Since his last inauguration six years ago, Putin has seized Crimea from Ukraine, triggering western economic sanctions, and ordered Russia’s military into Syria in support of President Bashar al-Assad. Russia has been a useful bogeyman since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. UK military chiefs were spooked when\u0026nbspRussia, during an intervention in Ukraine, used a combination of drones and artillery to destroy Ukrainian armour, and raised questions about whether the UK would be able to do much better than the Ukrainians in similar circumstances.The UK is far enough away for Russia not to pose a territorial threat. But UK forces are deployed in the Baltic states along with US and other Nato forces as a deterrent in the unlikely event of a Russian landgrab.Russia does present a threat through hybrid warfare, or the use of deniable acts of disruption – primarily cyber-attacks on the UK that could disrupt essential services or interference in the democratic process, such as in elections.Just weeks before his election victory in March, Putin presented what he said were Moscow’s invincible new nuclear weapons, his bellicose speech accompanied by an animated video that showed Russian warheads falling on Florida. Fyodor Lukyanov, a political analyst who sometimes advises the Kremlin, has described the current standoff with the west as a state of cold war.Monday’s inauguration ceremony came just two days after Russian security forces assisted by Cossack fighters detained hundreds of people, including the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, at an anti-Putin protest in central Moscow. The EU condemned “police brutality and mass arrests”, and human rights figures demanded an investigation into why Cossacks had been allowed to attack opposition supporters, including with leather whips. Russian opposition media said on Sunday that Moscow city hall has paid a pro-Kremlin Cossack organisation almost £190,000 to ensure public order in the Russian capital.Putin, who has ruled Russia for longer than anyone except Joseph Stalin, begins his new six-year term of office as an economic downturn has plunged millions of Russians into poverty. Russia’s economic slump has also meant an increasingly vicious struggle for resources among the country’s government and security apparatus, analysts say. Alexei Ulyukayev, the country’s former economy minister, was jailed for eight years in December on corruption charges that were widely interpreted as a rare case of Kremlin infighting spilling out into the open. The recent jailing of state security officials on corruption charges is also evidence of “intensified competition” for financial resources between officials at Russia’s interior ministry and the FSB intelligence agency, said Yekaterina Schulmann, a prominent political analyst.Opposition figures, who accuse Putin of caring only about the economic interests of his friends and family members, reacted with scorn to the former KGB officer’s inauguration pledge to serve ordinary Russians. “Putin said Russians will live better, but he didn’t say which ones,” read a popular online joke."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481526.1525634953!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house rules how to get your first mortgage","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThings which help demonstrate a borrower’s desirability to a bank include savings and paying rent.

Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersIreland will be used as a key pressure point at a crucial summit next month to force the UK to clarify its future relationship with the EU, Michel Barnier has said.In a private briefing in Brussels last week, the European Union’s chief negotiator also insisted Brexit does not threaten the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and asked for “drama” to be taken out of the Border proposals.In a briefing to representatives of the EU27, the bloc’s remaining member states, he said the risk of a breakdown in the talks later in the year will be heightened if there is no “early progress on Irish issues”. He was reporting on his recent trip to Northern Ireland and Ireland. An account of his briefing was sent to Dublin by Irish officials.The briefing, elements of which have been seen by The , says Germany and France support the position that talks must not progress to a future EU-UK deal unless all elements of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal treaty are agreed. This includes the so-called backstop, which would ensure no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland without agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border.The EU has proposed this would mean Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union after Brexit. That has been rejected by the British prime minister, Theresa May, and the DUP, which supports her Conservative government in a confidence-and-supply deal at Westminster.“France also shared Barnier’s view on the need to reach agreement on outstanding withdrawal-agreement issues, including Ireland, by June,” the notes say. “Germany said it was essential that the Irish issue was not left ‘open to the end and then isolated’.”Mr Barnier said the EU “had specific leverage points” at European Council summits last December and March. “In June, the primary leverage point will be to make clear to the UK that finalising the outstanding aspects of the Withdrawal Agreement, ‘including on Ireland’, is a precondition to a constructive discussion on the future,” the account of his briefing said. Mr Barnier said the backstop does not affect the constitutional status of Northern Ireland but only sets out what checks are necessary after Brexit. He argued there are already checks between Britain and Northern Ireland for agricultural produce. “What he has learnt from his visit to IrelandNorthern Ireland is that all sides need to take the drama out of what is being proposed. Barnier repeatedly said he was moved by all communities in Ireland.”Speaking yesterday, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said Northern Ireland must “move in lockstep” with the rest of the United Kingdom. “We don’t believe we have to stay in the customs union to have free flow between ourselves and the Republic of Ireland.”A decision on the British government’s preferred customs option has been postponed after Ms May failed to secure the support of her ministers for a proposed hybrid “customs partnership” between the EU and UK. The arrangement would see British officials collect tariffs on behalf of the European Union for any goods coming to the UK that were subsequently destined for an EU member state.

Video: ITV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRobert  Peston on ‘Peston on Sunday’. Photograph: ITVTV presenter Robert Peston has suggested that Ireland has “undermined” British governments for at least the last century. In an interview with prominent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, Mr Peston described the Tory as a keen student of British history, before saying: “Ireland has undermined, the issue of Ireland in so many different ways has undermined, British governments, you know, going back well over 100 years now.” Mr Rees-Mogg responded by suggesting that the issue of Ireland had undermined British politics for “much more than 100 years. It’s a very long and complex history.”The interview took place on Mr Peston’s eponymous Peston on Sunday programme on ITV. Mr Peston suggested to Mr Rees-Mogg that in the absence of a post-Brexit customs arrangement, any Border checks could “undermine the peace that . . . has been so beneficial over the past few years”. Mr Rees-Mogg responded by stating that it was “deeply disgraceful that people who wish to keep us in the European Union are threatening the spectre of a return to terror to try and make people accept their views”. He said that those who raised the prospect of a return to violence “are all committed Europeans, some of them in receipt of pensions from the EU. “I think it’s deeply disgraceful to raise the spectre of lawlessness and of murder in pursuit of a political objective.” Mr Rees-Mogg pointed to the pro-Brexit stance of one of the key architects of the Belfast Agreement, former UUP leader David Trimble. Mr Trimble has said he does not share the contention of some Remainers that a return to a hard Border could undermine the peace process. Mr Rees-Mogg is one of the foremost Tories advocating that the UK leave both the customs union and the single market. He suggested during the interview that leaving both entities while keeping a soft Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland would be “very straightforward”, as neither the British nor the Irish government wanted to impose a hard Border. He cited claims by the head of HM Revenue and Customs, Jon Thompson, that a Border already exists between the Republic and the North. “It’s important to remember that there already is a Border: there is a Border for currency there is a Border for immigration there is a Border for excise, and there is a Border for VAT. But this does not need a physical infrastructure at the Border, and that’s what a hard Border is,” Mr Rees-Mogg said. “There may indeed need to be non-Border checks that take place – that would be perfectly reasonable in the new situation. But if we remain in the customs union and the single market, we’d lose the advantages of leaving.” Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3486887.1525706452!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new cervicalcheck head sorry for delay in returning calls","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCervicalCheck is hoping to increase the number of experienced health professionals and to clear the log jam of calls by the end of this week.The new head of CervicalCheck has apologised for the delay in returning calls to 75 per cent of women who have contacted the helpline service.The service was set up after Limerick mother of two Vicky Phelan (43) settled a High Court action against a US laboratory, subcontracted by the CervicalCheck screening programme to assess her smear tests, without admission of liability for €2.5 million last week.Ms Phelan discovered that a 2011 smear test that had initially shown no abnormalities was, three years later, found to be inaccurate. She was not told of the false test until September 2017. She is now suffering from terminal cancer.It subesequently emerged that 209 women had been affected by the cervical cancer scandal.Damien McCallion replaced CervicalCheck’s clinical director Gráinne Flannelly, who resigned last month. He told RTÉ’s News at One programme on Monday that priority was being given to women with a history of cancer or abnormal smear readings. The process is that records are checked and then calls are returned by a health professional who has experience in treating cancer, he said.Mr McCallion added that they are hoping to increase the number of experienced health professionals and to clear the log jam of calls by the end of this week.“We are hopeful we can increase the number of calls that can be dealt with by more professionals.“Overtime, increased hours and a huge input from staff who have come in over the bank holiday weekend are helping. We are trying to get through calls as quickly as possible.“We aim to get through the vast majority this week. We are also texting others to keep them informed.”Mr McCallion advised that guidance is available through www.cervicalcheck.ie and maintained that there is no variation between the three laboratories used to examine smear tests.“There is no variation between the three inidual laboratories. The results are within international norms.”"},{"url":null,"title":"peston ireland has undermined britain for over 100 years","story":"  May 6, 2018TV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3486914.1525707723!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mutterings about miche%C3%A1l martin as fianna f%C3%A1il leader","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin:  Given his experience and work rate, he remains the best leader available to the party. Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsThat is not to say it is under immediate threat, nor that there is anybody else who currently could do a better job. In fact, Martin, given his experience and work rate, remains the best leader available. Nevertheless, as the party trails Fine Gael in the polls, and remains wedded to a “confidence and supply’’ arrangement with the minority Government, his parliamentary colleagues are wondering what the future holds for Fianna Fáil. There are private mutterings of discontent. Some TDs feel he relies too heavily on key advisers Deirdre Gillane and Pat McPartland, while excluding his colleagues. But this is not a view universally held.“I have no great problem with a leader relying on advisers if that leader is delivering,’’ said a TD. “My problem is that we sure where we are going and who is going with us.’’The “who is going with us’’ refers to the numbers’ game that will determine the formation of a government after the next election. Both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will be seeking to secure the extra numbers to form a coalition. A Rainbow arrangement, including the small parties such as Labour, Social Democrats and the Green Party, as well Independents, might provide the numbers for either party, depending on the post-election scenario. Martin has ruled out Sinn Féin as post-election government partners. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has done the same. Yet Martin’s strong dismissal of a coalition arrangement with Sinn Féin is privately rejected by some of his colleagues. “Of course, we would do a deal with Sinn Féin, all things being equal,’’ said a Fianna Fáil TD. “If Micheál did not like it, he could step down as leader.”Martin’s post-election dilemma could be acute, if a Fianna Fáil-Sinn Féin emerges as a possibility. Does he do a U-turn and become taoiseach, or forfeit the leadership?But all that, if it happens, is down the road. The immediate problem for Martin and his party is when to pull the plug on the deal keeping the minority Government in power. Fianna Fáil committed itself to supporting three budgets, the last of which is due in October. Party sources say it is likely to fulfil that mandate and, then, all bets will be off. That could mean a general election in the spring of next year.A complicating factor is that local and European elections are due in the summer of next year, demanding much time and effort from the parties. Meanwhile, there is inevitably speculation on who might take over if the Martin era came to an end for whatever reason.Right now, the consensus is that the leadership would likely be between Martin’s Cork South Central constituency colleague and finance spokesman, Michael McGrath, and justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan, a TD for Dublin Bay South. O’Callaghan would have the advantage of coming from Dublin, where the party is weak.Others, no doubt, would be tempted to consider their chances. Deputy leader Dara Calleary is a highly respected figure in the party, while TDs Niall Collins, Timmy Dooley, Billy Kelleher, Barry Cowen and Darragh O’Brien are not without ambition. Mayo TD Lisa Chambers, appointed by Martin as Brexit spokeswoman, is regarded as somebody to watch in the long-term. Martin’s leadership could receive a major boost later this month if, as the polls suggest, the abortion referendum is carried. He has strongly advocated a Yes vote, while more than half of his parliamentary party is on the No side. A Yes vote would see the party leader more in tune with the public mood. On the other hand, a No vote would be a setback. First elected to the Dáil in 1989, he has been around since the Haughey era. He knows no leader can rest on their laurels and that some people within his parliamentary party are concerned about the future. -the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/06/TELEMMGLPICT000162447754_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyuLFFzXshuGqnr8zPdDWXiTUh73-1IAIBaONvUINpkg.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"britains unpopular railway station revealed","story":"Passengers described the station in Glasgow as a \u0026#39disaster\u0026#39A third world railway station where passengers are too embarrassed to take friends and relatives has been revealed as Britain\u0027s most unpopular.Only 58 per cent of passengers said they were “satisfied” with Glasgow Queen Street, according to a survey conducted by the independent rail watchdog Transport Focus.The survey was conducted between September and November last year, shortly after a £100 million modernisation project began at the city centre terminal.Passenger Cameron MacIntosh, 32, a sales adviser from Stirling, said: The station is an absolute bomb site at the moment. It really looks like a place from the third world. I try and avoid it.John McInnes, a 46-year-old technician from Cumbernauld, commented: I hope they are going to finish it because it looks a disaster just now.It\u0027s embarrassing bringing friends or relations here. They can\u0027t believe the mess of the place.Only 58 per cent of passengers say they are \u0026#34satisfied\u0026#34 with the stationPassengers\u0027 top priorities for stations include arrival time information, waiting rooms and the overall look and feel of the station, according to Transport Focus.The second worst score was given for the station serving Gatwick Airport, followed by Oxford, and Clapham Junction. These saw satisfaction ratings of 66 per cent, 67 per cent and 69 per cent respectively.Glasgow Queen Street, the third busiest railway station in Scotland, is being upgraded to modernise its appearance and increase its capacity.The station currently handles approximately 20 million passengers a year. This is expected to increase to 28 million by 2030.Under plans, the redevelopment of the station will be completed by June 2019.Commenting on Glasgow Queen Street’s poor satisfaction rating Anthony Smith, the chief executive of Transport Focus, said: While Glasgow Queen Street is being redeveloped it\u0027s vital that the ScotRail Alliance continues to talk to passengers about the improvements and makes sure staff are on hand to help.”The top four stations were London King\u0027s Cross, London St Pancras, Birmingham New Street and Reading, which all had satisfaction ratings above 90 per cent.100 species discovered as scientists find new ocean zone Don\u0026#39t buy a flashy car if you\u0026#39re looking for a serious relationship, study saysSale of Cambodian newspaper sparks fears of crackdown on press freedomUK weather: May Bank Holiday heat record broken as temperatures pass 28CHizbollah-led alliance takes majority in parliament, in boost to IranAustralia unveils plan to save endangered koalasParaglider killed in \u0026#39mid-air collision\u0026#39politan Police spend £400,000 on luxury first class flights for officersWhat happens if Donald Trump pulls out of the Iran nuclear deal?Leopard snatches and eats toddler in Ugandan national park Belgian motorist \u0026#39caught speeding\u0026#39 at 696kph in an Opel AstraIndian teenager gang-raped and burned alive in latest case to shock country The Lake District trials futuristic driverless vehicles in bid to tackle congestionBoris Johnson warns Donald Trump not to \u0026#39throw the baby out with the water\u0026#39 over Iran nuclear dealArmed patrols stepped up across London after Bank Holiday weekend of violenceArchbishop of Canterbury preparing for Royal wedding by listening to StormzyWhat do Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s shoes reveal about the reclusive North Korean leader?Russia\u0026#39s Putin sworn in for another six years in office Korean Air matriarch under investigation as employees demand ousting of \u0026#39nut rage\u0026#39 familyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/06/TELEMMGLPICT000162434964_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"duchess cambridge has demonstrated hand me downs much nostalgia","story":"A tender kiss for the new baby brotherThe first family pictures of Prince Louis have been released by Kensington Palace, and they show... a baby.

Some were heard shouting “Beirut has become Shia”.Its members were accused over the 2005 assassination of Mr Hariri, whose son Saad is currently prime minister.A child holds a picture of Hizbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah during election rallies a few days before the general election in BaalbeckHizbollah’s military arm is considered a terrorist entity by the UK however Britain is open to contact with its political wing, which already has two seats in parliament.With backing from Iran, Hizbollah has grown from fledgling resistance group to one of the most powerful militias in the region.Since the country’s last vote, in 2009, Hizbollah has sent thousands of its fighters across the border to the war in Syria in a bid to shore up Bashar al-Assad, who is also backed by Tehran.Its increasingly important position in Lebanon reflects Iran’s ascendancy in territory stretching through Iraq and Syria to Beirut.A Hizbollah fighter stands at a watchtower at the site where clashes erupted between the militia and al-Qaeda-linked fighters along the Lebanon-Syria borderHaving majority in parliament will better position Hizbollah to fend off any suggestion it should disarm and allow the group to more tightly direct the country’s foreign and defence policy.“Hizbollah seeks to translate politically in Lebanon its ‘victory’ in Syria, but it does not want to talk too loudly about it. It is playing quietly and smartly,” said Emile Hokayem, Middle East analyst at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies think-tank.The tiny state of Lebanon, which is half the size of Wales, finds itself in the middle of a regional battle between Iran and its arch foe, Saudi Arabia.The result will be of concern to Riyadh, which has accused the Lebanese government of giving cover to Hizbollah and has scaled back support for Mr Hariri in protest.Lebanon\u0026#39s prime minister Saad Hariri takes a selfie with French President Emmanuel Macron (C) and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (R) at The Elysee Palace in ParisMr Hariri was forced by Saudi’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to resign in November, in a move which appeared to backfire.The West-backed candidate’s Future party lost a number of seats in its strongholds in Beirut, Tripoli and Sidon to Hizbollah-backed Sunni candidates.The party also appeared to be the main victim of Lebanon’s apparent political apathy - more than half of eligible voters stayed home on Sunday.Iranian media gloated at Mr Hariri setbacks Iran’s hardline Tasnim news agency ran a report headlined: Lebanese election result puts an end to Hariri’s monopoly among Sunnis.However, Mr Hariri still leads the biggest Sunni bloc in parliament and is expected to stay on as prime minister - a position which must be filled by a Sunni Muslim under the country’s complex confessionalist system.  Israel has also watched on nervously as Hizbollah has been building up its presence in Syria, as well as an enormous arsenal of missiles - now reported to be 100,000-strong.Protesters burn an Israeli flag during a demonstration, organised by Hizbollah, in the streets of the southern Lebanese port city of Sidon in December An Israeli security cabinet minister said the gains in the vote showed that Israel should not distinguish between the Lebanese state and Hizbollah in any future war, the prospect of which now seems more likely than ever.Hizbollah  Lebanon, Naftali Bennett, education minister and leader of Israel’s right-wing Jewish Home party, said on Twitter on Monday.The State of Israel (...) will view Lebanon as responsible for any action from within its territory.100 species discovered as scientists find new ocean zone Don\u0026#39t buy a flashy car if you\u0026#39re looking for a serious relationship, study saysSale of Cambodian newspaper sparks fears of crackdown on press freedomUK weather: May Bank Holiday heat record broken as temperatures pass 28CAustralia unveils plan to save endangered koalasParaglider killed in \u0026#39mid-air collision\u0026#39politan Police spend £400,000 on luxury first class flights for officersWhat happens if Donald Trump pulls out of the Iran nuclear deal?Leopard snatches and eats toddler in Ugandan national park Belgian motorist \u0026#39caught speeding\u0026#39 at 696kph in an Opel AstraIndian teenager gang-raped and burned alive in latest case to shock country The Lake District trials futuristic driverless vehicles in bid to tackle congestionBoris Johnson warns Donald Trump not to \u0026#39throw the baby out with the water\u0026#39 over Iran nuclear dealArmed patrols stepped up across London after Bank Holiday weekend of violenceArchbishop of Canterbury preparing for Royal wedding by listening to StormzyWhat do Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s shoes reveal about the reclusive North Korean leader?Russia\u0026#39s Putin sworn in for another six years in office Korean Air matriarch under investigation as employees demand ousting of \u0026#39nut rage\u0026#39 familyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"leopard snatches eats toddler ugandan national park","story":"Leopard in Uganda\u0026#39s Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda, AfricaUgandan authorities are hunting for a leopard in Queen Elizabeth National park  after it snatched and ate a ranger\u0027s three-year-old son. The toddler had been left in the care of a nanny at the unfenced staff quarters of a safari lodge in the park, when he was taken by the leopard on Friday night.Wildlife authority spokesman Bashir Hangi said the child had followed the nanny outdoors.The maid was not aware the child followed her. She heard the kid scream for help, she intervened but it was too late the leopard had vanished with it in the bush and a search was mounted until we got the skull the next day, he said.The hunt is on with the intention of capturing the leopard and removing it from the wild because once it has eaten human flesh, the temptations are high to eat another human being, it becomes dangerous, he added.The sun sets over Lake George near Uganda\u0026#39s Queen Elizabeth National Park in western Uganda,Queen Elizabeth is Uganda\u0027s most-visited national park, with tourists flocking to watch leopards roam the Mweya Peninsula, which lies beside Lake Edward.The park also hosts African buffalo, Nile crocodile, lions and chimpanzees. The attack comes just a week after a British safari park owner was attacked by a lion in South Africa. Mike Hodge, 71, suffered a broken jaw after he was mauled in Marakele Animal Sanctuary in Thabazimbi.Mr Hodge had been showing visitors around the park when the big cat charged him and dragged him into some bushes.Video footage of the incident showed terrified tourists screaming for help as the lion mauled its victim.Keepers eventually killed the 10-year-old lion, named Samba, and Mr Hodge was taken to hospital.  Two years ago, in South Africa, a year a six-year-old boy was snatched by a leopard at Kruger National park, but the youngster escaped with his life. Kellan Denny was playing with his brother on a wall when the leopard sunk its teeth into his shoulder and dragged him away. However, the leopard let go of the traumatised boy, allowing his father to rush in and carry him to safety. The incident was the first of its kind in 40 years, according to a spokesman for Kruger National Park. 100 species discovered as scientists find new ocean zone Don\u0026#39t buy a flashy car if you\u0026#39re looking for a serious relationship, study saysSale of Cambodian newspaper sparks fears of crackdown on press freedomUK weather: May Bank Holiday heat record broken as temperatures pass 28CHizbollah-led alliance takes majority in parliament, in boost to IranAustralia unveils plan to save endangered koalasParaglider killed in \u0026#39mid-air collision\u0026#39politan Police spend £400,000 on luxury first class flights for officersWhat happens if Donald Trump pulls out of the Iran nuclear deal?Belgian motorist \u0026#39caught speeding\u0026#39 at 696kph in an Opel AstraIndian teenager gang-raped and burned alive in latest case to shock country The Lake District trials futuristic driverless vehicles in bid to tackle congestionBoris Johnson warns Donald Trump not to \u0026#39throw the baby out with the water\u0026#39 over Iran nuclear dealArmed patrols stepped up across London after Bank Holiday weekend of violenceArchbishop of Canterbury preparing for Royal wedding by listening to StormzyWhat do Kim Jong-un\u0026#39s shoes reveal about the reclusive North Korean leader?Russia\u0026#39s Putin sworn in for another six years in office Korean Air matriarch under investigation as employees demand ousting of \u0026#39nut rage\u0026#39 familyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"asda sainsburys merger deal latest job losses new economics foundation","story":"Supermarket boss has promised 10 per cent price cuts for customersUp to 2,500 jobs in supply chains could be at risk from the proposed merger of Asda and Sainsbury’s, the New Economics Foundation has warned. According to analysis by the think tank, the promised price cuts – Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has pledged a 10 per cent reduction for consumers – will be passed onto suppliers. The NEF found that a 5 per cent cut in output for these suppliers could lead to a loss of more than 1,200 jobs, while a 10 per cent cut could lead to a loss of up to 2,500 jobs.Former Asda exec slams Sainsbury’s deal and says it should be blockedSainsbury’s boss caught singing ‘We’re in the money’ before interviewSainsbury’s fights back amid tough retail market with Asda merger planIn addition, the NEF warned, total job losses connected to the merger could end up higher still “as these estimates do not cover the total supply chain, or the further impact of lost demand in local economies from reduced spending by companies, employees and their families, which could lead to further business closures and job losses outside of supermarket supply chains”.“If the proposed merger between Sainsbury’s and Asda is allowed to proceed, we are likely to see a classic case of monopoly-like power in a mark,” said Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the New Economics Foundation.“This is part of a broader picture, where time and again UK capitalism shows itself to be geared against small business in a way rarely seen in the rest of Western Europe. Small and medium-sized firms make up more than 99 per cent of all UK companies, 60 per cent of employment and nearly half of turnover, yet they are repeatedly required to play second fiddle.” Business minister Andrew Griffiths said last week that he had spoken with the groceries code adjudicator, Christine Tacon, “to reiterate the importance of ensuring suppliers, and in particular SMEs, are treated fairly” by Asda and Sainsbury’s. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

According to analysis by the think tank, the promised price cuts – Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe has pledged a 10 per cent reduction for consumers – will be passed onto suppliers. The NEF found that a 5 per cent cut in output for these suppliers could lead to a loss of more than 1,200 jobs, while a 10 per cent cut could lead to a loss of up to 2,500 jobs.Former Asda exec slams Sainsbury’s deal and says it should be blockedSainsbury’s boss caught singing ‘We’re in the money’ before interviewSainsbury’s fights back amid tough retail market with Asda merger planIn addition, the NEF warned, total job losses connected to the merger could end up higher still “as these estimates do not cover the total supply chain, or the further impact of lost demand in local economies from reduced spending by companies, employees and their families, which could lead to further business closures and job losses outside of supermarket supply chains”.“If the proposed merger between Sainsbury’s and Asda is allowed to proceed, we are likely to see a classic case of monopoly-like power in a mark,” said Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the New Economics Foundation.“This is part of a broader picture, where time and again UK capitalism shows itself to be geared against small business in a way rarely seen in the rest of Western Europe. Small and medium-sized firms make up more than 99 per cent of all UK companies, 60 per cent of employment and nearly half of turnover, yet they are repeatedly required to play second fiddle.” Business minister Andrew Griffiths said last week that he had spoken with the groceries code adjudicator, Christine Tacon, “to reiterate the importance of ensuring suppliers, and in particular SMEs, are treated fairly” by Asda and Sainsbury’s. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The cost of paying privately for dialysis sessions in the EU is up to €1,000 (£880) a week depending on the circumstances and procedures used.”Jeremy Hunt supported Remain during the referendum (Getty)Charities echoed the MEPs’ comments, warning that long-term conditions would continue to “cross borders” whatever the political status of the UK.Fiona Loud, policy director at the charity Kidney Care UK, told The Independent: “Every day we hear from people who are anxious about the very real possibility that their freedom to travel could be curtailed due to changes in reciprocal healthcare rights. Whatever happens as we leave the EU, the needs of people with long-term conditions will continue to cross borders.“For the 29,000 people in the UK who have kidney failure and who need dialysis to stay alive, the EHIC system is essential to allow them to travel in Europe. Everyone has the right to live their lives to the full, including people on dialysis so we need a clear commitment from the government to protect kidney patients post-Brexit. “Whatever happens as we leave the EU, the needs of people with long-term conditions will continue to cross borders.”In the early stages of withdrawal talks, the EU guaranteed that anyone abroad at the point of Brexit would be able to retain their EHIC card. But there has been no reported movement on the status of the card for other travellers, making up the vast majority of the population.Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP and one of the letter’s signatories, added: “Far from providing a boost to the NHS – Brexit means all patients lose their free healthcare rights when travelling abroad in the EU.One year to Brexit: what is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?“It’s time Jeremy Hunt stood up for the NHS and the vulnerable in these negotiations.“Whatever the Brexit deal looks like, the British people should have the final say on whether they think it is as good as the deal we have now inside the EU.”Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

They are making a big decision as to where the next motor plant should be in Europe.“We have a very successful one in Deeside, in North Wales, but there are choices as to whether that should be located on the continent. “Between that plant and the plant in Derbyshire there are 3,500 people employed. The nature of that business is that over 50 per cent of the parts come from out of the country. They come through every hour of the day and night ... It’s just in time manufacturing. It is highly efficient. “What we have always said is we will have a customs agreement that has the minimum of frictions. Now that is crucial.”Tory rebels: We can push May towards single market, if Labour backs usBank of America moving 125 UK jobs to Ireland because of Brexit ‘Manual workarounds’ plan over fears IT systems not ready for BrexitBrexit blamed for weak services growth in AprilMs May’s customs plans will help firms as it would mean you can import parts without border checks or paperwork, he said.Mr Clark added: “But it’s not perfect, because what it means is that if we have imports from other countries where we’ve abolished the tariff, there has to be an arrangement where you pay back.”He also opened the door to extending a transition period on customs with the EU, saying it could be a case of implementing a new customs arrangement “as soon as you can do” rather than 2020 when the transition would expire.It could take until 2023 to put new infrastructure in place, he added.Former home secretary Amber Rudd, who resigned last week over the Windrush scandal, immediately tweeted her support of Mr Clark’s plans.Business leaders also welcomed Mr Clark’s comments, saying it was important to maintain the status quo on frictionless trade until a new arrangement is in place.However Mr Rees-Mogg, chairman of the powerful European Research Group (ERG) of Tory Brexiteers, said it would be “odd” for Ms May to back a policy that effectively breached her commitment on leaving both the customs union and single market.He told ITV’s Peston on Sunday: “This Project Fear has been so thoroughly discredited that you would have thought it would have come to an end by now.“We trade successfully all over the world.

He lived his last years exiled in London, where he authored the Communist Manifesto, his best-known work.All the ways in which Marx was unexpectedly right“Karl Marx was a philosopher, who thought into the future had creative aspirations, and today he stands for things, which is he not responsible for and which he didn\u0027t cause, because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite,” Mr Juncker said in a speech at a church in Trier.“One has to understand Karl Marx from the context of his time and not have prejudices based on the review, these judgements shouldn\u0027t exist. Karl Marx was lucky in life as he was born in Trier. He grew up in the city, actually the shortest period of his vita.”Drawing on the philosopher’s legacy, Mr Juncker said the European Union’s instability could be addressed by focusing more on social welfare, which he said had been a neglected part of European integration so far.“It will be a task of our time to create a lively reality out of the social rights we set up for Europe, for the ones who live today and often are sad or blackmailed by life and won\u0027t have enough social rights and the ones, who will be born tomorrow,” he said.Marx\u0027s birthday is being celebrated across the world(AP)“The European Union is not a flawed, but an unstable construction. Unstable also because Europe\u0027s social dimension until today remains the poor relation of the European integration. We have to change this.”A former student of the philosopher Hegel, Marx developed the theory of historical materialism which he argued explained the development of human society and the development of social classes. His work argues that capitalism’s creation of a mass of workers who owned no property will be its downfall. He argued for the establishment of a “dictatorship of the proletariat” through which workers would become the dominant class.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The arrests were often violent, and sometimes with the support of unofficial vigilante forces. Police released Mr Navalny later that evening, but many of his supporters remained in custody throughout the inauguration. Today’s ceremony mainly followed the protocol of previous years, but there were departures. The major innovation was the debut of Mr Putin’s new 12.5bn ruble limousine, the “Kortezh”. But the car would not sweep through central Moscow as six years ago. The image of a depopulated city centre on lockdown that day left an awkward aftertaste, and today there would be no repeat.Instead, Mr Putin’s new limousine made the short trip from his Kremlin offices to the ceremonial halls. Key Putin opponent among hundreds arrested in violent Moscow clashesTrump targets Russian oligarchs and Putin allies in fresh US sanctionsDonald Trump suggested meeting Vladimir Putin at the White HouseTrump ‘tells Vladimir Putin: “If there is an arms race, ‘I’ll win’”Inside, dignitaries included some of Mr Putin’s closest friends, like the former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and American actor Steven Seagal. There were the stars of Russia’s beau monde – from film director Nikita Mikhalkov to rapper Timati. And there was a mix of the stranger symbols of Mr Putin’s rule: biker Alexander Zaldostanov, aka “the surgeon” the uber-loyal head of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill and the tsar-worshipping, ultra-conservative Natalia Poklonskaya. Pro-Kremlin youth and the heads of the regional electoral commission were also on the guest list. These groups were the sergeants of March’s presidential elections, considered a great success. That vote returned Mr Putin with a 77 per cent share, and proved to be a disaster for the liberal opposition. Looking relaxed, contented, and not without swagger, Mr Putin delivered a short address. The message was simple enough. The president repeated the promises of a decisive technological breakthrough he first made during his state-of-the-nation speech in March. But he was notably less belligerent this time. Nuclear weapons had given way to motherhood, youth and raising living standards. “Russia has been through troubles before,” he said. “And we always rise above them, like a Phoenix.” Later in the day, the president confirmed that, as expected, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev would retain his role as head of the government. According to some sources, Mr Putin was also likely to appoint the liberal reformer Alexei Kudrin to a top economic post. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesRussian police carrying struggling opposition leader Alexei Navalny at a demonstration against President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

These will mostly be paid for by increased taxes, given the limited appetite for serious reform.“No one is debating whether to reject crony capitalism, state control of business and the economy, or the confrontation with the West,” said Valery Solovey, professor of the Moscow State Institute for International Relations. “Of course, this is why there will be no real breakthrough”.According to a poll published on Monday by the independent Levada Centre, Russians say welfare and inequality remain the government’s biggest failure to date. The Kremlin fares better when it comes to foreign policy, with half mentioning the return of great power status as Mr Putin’s major achievement. The combination of both factors means political liberalisation is unlikely to be around the corner, Mr Solovey said.“It is too early to make strategic conclusions,” said Mr Solovey. “But if confrontation with the West and social tensions continue on their current trajectory, domestic policy is only going to get tougher.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I\u0027m a backbench Tory MP.The Conservative manifesto said that we would leave the customs union and we would leave the single market.I believe that politicians should implement the promises that they\u0027ve given in manifestos.So all I\u0027ve been doing - and other members of the European Research Group have been doing - is encouraging the government to stick to the promises it has made and the Prime Minister Theresa May has made very clear in her various speeches, whether it\u0027s the Lancaster House, Florence or Mansion House speech.SKYThe MP for Somerset North denied that he had done anything wrongMr Rees-Mogg praised Mrs May as a very remarkable personSo we are very consistent with government policy, we are supporting the government implementing its policy in the face of a lot of opposition from other sources, particularly at the moment the House of Lords.Mr Rees-Mogg added that it would be bizarre to think that Mrs May would retreat from that promise of leaving the customs union and that he doesn\u0027t think she\u0027s going to.The Brexiteer went on to praise Mrs May as a very remarkable person.He added: She is a formidable leader with great abilities.That\u0027s why I\u0027m supporting her and supporting what she promised to do."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Bank-Holiday-opening-times-Lidl-956172.jpg","title":"Bank Holiday Monday 2018 opening times what time does Lidl open bank holiday Monday","story":"Bank Holiday opening times: Lidl will open todayToday marks the arrival of the first bank holiday Monday of this month, with another due on May 28.And it is expected to be the warmest bank holidya on record, with BBC Weather expecting the UK to be hit with record-breaking temperatures as the mercury reaches a sweltering 28C.Some forecasters have even claimed the sweltering temperatures could even reach 29C in some parts of the UK.And with the glorious heat and thousands taking a day off work, many people across the country will likely be brandishing the kebab skewers and turning on the gas as they drag out the BBQ for the first time this year.

A vibrant metropolis, at ease with its diverse, tolerant self.A shining example to the world of how folk from different backgrounds and cultures can rub along together.At least, that’s what we’re invited to believe. But the truth is this depiction of our capital city is not one recognised by millions of its citizens. That’s because London is, in fact, a tale of two cities.There are the gentrified hotbeds of liberal cosmopolitanism — the Islingtons and Camdens — top-heavy with the professional classes and cultural elites, the type of areas that were a bedrock of Remain support in the EU referendum.But then there are those places outside the bubble. On the one hand the grittier, traditional working-class areas — the Canning Towns and Bermondseys — populated by those steamrollered by globalisation, for whom austerity and mass immigration have exacerbated the problems of low wages, poor housing and under-pressure public services.On the other, the middle-class suburbs — the Upminsters and Eastcotes — inhabited by those who sense that their “small c” conservatism is increasingly incongruous with the image of their city as a beacon of progressive modernity.It is between these places that a new and unintended coalition has emerged, born out of resentment at having  to watch their old-fashioned, socially conservative — what some describe as “faith, family and flag” — views shunned and disparaged by the liberal elite.You can see something similar writ large across England: An accidental alliance between once-loyal Labour voters in the post-industrial towns and Conservatives in the shires.It’s an alliance which manifested itself most starkly in the Brexit vote.For the Londoners that fall within these groups, their city is not the harmonious and cohesive ideal seen through the eyes of the chattering classes.It is, instead, a place increasingly atomised, where millions feel a diminishing sense of belonging and in which entire communities within a few hundred yards of each other live utterly parallel lives.Take, for example, the borough in which I grew up, Barking and Dagenham.As working-class as it gets, it was once the very essence of a traditional Labour heartland. Never affluent, but stable, close-knit and settled.Centred around a sprawling 1930s council estate and with generally healthy levels of employment — the dominant Ford factory being at the heart of local industry — Barking and Dagenham enjoyed its steady constancy, its social and cultural familiarity.For those short on money and opportunity, the concepts of place, belonging, identity and relationships take on so much more meaning.But then things changed. Over a few very short years, around the turn of the century, there was a sizeable influx of migrants, precipitating rapid social and cultural transformation.The demographic convulsions meant stable, settled Barking and Dagenham found itself in the eye of the storm of the debate over mass immigration.The indigenous population cried out for respite. The letters page of the local paper was filled with correspondents begging to be heard. But nobody in power took a blind bit of notice, other than to patronise them with trite arguments about improved GDP and cultural enrichment.Rather than rally to their support, the Left — including, shamefully, the Labour Party and trade unions — treated these marginalised working-class folk like an embarrassing elderly relative, imploring them to “stop blaming migrants” (something they hadn’t done in the first place).What was genuine bewilderment and disorientation on the part of local citizens was, inexcusably, dismissed as casual racism and bigotry.Yet it wasn’t their sense of race that had been violated by the sudden upheaval in their community. It was their sense of order.So, in 2006, locals took the only route of protest they thought left available to them and returned  12 British National Party councillors at the local elections.The noxious far-Right, which previously had never gained a foothold in the borough (though it had penetrated areas close by) now formed the official opposition on Barking and Dagenham council, not because thousands of locals had overnight turned into vile racists, but because they had repeatedly been ignored by a tin-eared establishment.But even then, nothing changed. Locals were told to get with the zeitgeist.Women in their eighties who had lived in the borough for most of their lives, had raised  families there and in many cases now lived a life of lonely isolation, were told to embrace the vibrancy of the new multiculturalism.That was the level of condescension to which the liberal establishment had sunkSo thousands of people simply upped sticks and left. In the first decade of the new century, Barking and Dagenham experienced a vast exodus of families who had been rooted in its streets, workplaces and  institutions for generations.It was the only home that many had ever known, but they went all the same. They departed for the Essex coast or Kent. It wasn’t “white flight”, for skin colour was irrelevant to most of them.It was, instead, a flight to familiarity.The tragedy was that most of these people never were anti-immigration. They would not have objected to the integration of a modest and manageable number of arrivals over a reasonable period.But the whole debate around immigration has been toxified by what the ruling elites imposed on places such as Barking and Dagenham.They shook a kaleidoscope then stood back in surprise when the pieces didn’t fall exactly where they wanted. Remember all this the next time you hear someone speak of London as the greatest city in the world.Chances are the words are being spoken by a politician or a celebrity or a middle-class liberal from one of the trendier parts of town.For there are, in reality, two Londons.

Heres all you should know about why they are different.Ramadan, the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, is a period of fasting observed by Muslims across the globe to celebrate the best of times.It celebrates the first time the Koran was revealed to Muhammad, according to Islamic belief.Fasting is only obligatory for healthy adult Muslims, anyone who is suffering from an illness, travelling, elderly, pregnant, breastfeeding, diabetic, chronically ill or menstruating are exempt from the practice.The fasting period, during which Muslims are not allowed to eat or drink, is from dawn to sunset and Muslims engage in increased prayer activity.Muslims often try and practice a increased self discipline during the month of Ramadan.This year it starts on the evening of May 15 and ends in the evening of June 14Ramadan Mubarak translates to mean either blessed Ramadan or happy Ramadan.Ramadan Kareem means may Ramadan be generous to you but there is some debate as to if it should be used during Ramadan.The greetings are different as Ramadan Mubarak offers a blessed or happy Ramadan to the person it is exchanged with.Where as Ramadan Kareem has debate around its use as it asks Ramadan to be generous to the other person.There is some disagreement over its use as some people believe that asking Ramadan to be generous to you goes against the teachings of Islam, because Ramadan itself cannot be generous to an individual.Saudi Arabian scholar Sheikh Al-Uthaymeen told the Express: “It should be said ‘Ramadan Mubarak’, or whatever is similar to it, because it is not Ramadan itself that gives so that it can be kareem (generous), in fact it is Allah who placed the grace in it, and made it a special month, and a time to perform one of the pillars of Islam”.Ramadan Murbarak is the most commonly used of the two as it was originally used by the prophet MuhammadHowever, others believe using Ramadan Kareem is fine because they say the phrase represents the blessings that Allah gives his follows during the month.Jordan’s Iftaa’ Department, which is responsible for religious decrees, last year ruled: “Describing Ramadan to be honourable does not in fact attribute the quality to the month.“Rather, the word comes from the fact that God gives his worshippers blessings during the month.“It’s thus acceptable to call the thing by the name of its reason or cause.Some Muslims view Ramadan Kareem as a more respectful way of referring to Ramadan.Both greetings can be used throughout the whole month of Ramadan but Ramadan Murbarak tends to be the more commonly used of the two.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the customs partnership idea, which would involve the UK collecting tariff revenues on the EU’s behalf, would make the UK a much less attractive country to do trade deals with.To be fully effective, it would also  require the UK  to essentially copy all EU regulations on goods.With the scheme also leading to the European Court of Justice getting involved in Britain’s affairs, it would not be “taking back control”.But even after the remarkable rebuff it received from the Brexit inner Cabinet on Wednesday, despite the Prime Minister putting her authority on the line by making clear her support for it, No10 won’t give up on the idea. It believes that, with a few changes, it can be made to work.Ministers are now bracing themselves for a huge effort from Theresa May’s allies to get them to change their minds.Already, No10 is telling ministers that what really matters is getting out, and that once the UK is no longer a member of the EU, all these problems can be ironed out at a later date.I understand that one minister has even been warned that the whole Brexit project might collapse without a customs partnership.The argument is that there is “no deal” without a customs partnership, which the Government views as being  key to solving the Irish border question.Without a deal, Parliament could turn on Brexit.The Chief Whip has also told Cabinet colleagues that he hasn’t got the votes to defeat a customs union amendment in the Commons. So, the best way to see that off is to embrace a customs partnership instead.But the local election results show that the Tory vote is becoming more and more Leave dominated. Number crunchers estimate that 70 per cent of Tory voters are leavers.As one influential Tory warns, this means that if Mrs May loses Brexit Secretary David Davis or Boris Johnson from the Cabinet over the customs partnership “and is seen to be selling out Brexit, the Tories will be utterly screwed electorally”.Another problem with the customs partnership idea is the message it sends the EU.As one insider tells me: “The EU is trying to force us into a false choice between a customs union and no deal — and we’re encouraging that by not being clear enough in our negotiating position.”Rather than trying to pressure ministers into backing her customs partnership idea, Mrs May should tell the  EU she wants a free trade  deal with sensible customs arrangements that keeps red tape to a minimum.Once she has been clear, she might find the EU more willing to negotiate.THE country is there for the taking. The local election results show neither Labour nor the Tories are able to break the political stalemate.If these results were replicated at a General Election, we would have another hung parliament.It is easy to declare that the country is permanently split, and that’s why no party can win a big majority. But I don’t think that’s right.Rather, the problem is that neither Labour nor the Tories are capable of reaching out.If Labour was led by a working-class leader from the Midlands who stood up for the country, then they would be on course for a proper majority. Equally, if the Tories were led by a Brexiteer whose upbeat, optimistic vision could appeal in Remain areas then they would be beating Corbyn comfortably.  Indeed, these local election results suggest that Labour under Corbyn has stalled – that it hasn’t kept up the progress it made in last year’s General Election.Now, Labour are highly unlikely to change leader before the next election.Jeremy Corbyn and his allies have seized control of the commanding heights of the Labour Party, and the new members who so fervently believe in him wouldn’t back a challenge to him whatever Labour MPs do.But the Tories will almost certainly change their leader before 2022. These results are a reminder that they need to show  they have delivered on Brexit by the time of the next election. Government whips have been calling round to ask Tory MPs what they think of handing the  NHS a funding boost on its 70th birthday in July, and how they would pay for it.These results suggest they would be well advised to portray this money as the beginning of the Brexit dividend for the health service.This might stick in the craw of Tory Remainers, but  voters now expect them to deliver on Brexit promises.When the Tories pick their new leader they need to go for someone with cross-over appeal – someone who can firm up their support among Leave voters but reach out to Remainers too.I am told that Bercow, who is currently under pressure over bullying allegations, doesn’t feel   he can say this publicly. But I am assured that this is his plan. It remains to be seen whether the knowledge that Bercow will go  will curtail calls for him to quit.Many in the Commons feel  the claims against him must be properly investigated if Parliament is to show  it is serious about protecting its  staff. Senior figures in Government are also keen to see the back of  him because they suspect him of encouraging Labour’s use of an arcane procedural device – “a humble address” – to try to winkle embarrassing information out of ministers.PENNY MORDAUNT presented to Cabinet on the gender pay gap this week.She turned in an assured performance less than 24 hours after being appointed minister for women and equalities, telling ministers to demand a plan to close the gender pay gap from the sectors covered by their department.But as one female Cabinet minister points out, no one mentioned the elephant in  the room – the fact that the second most senior woman  in the Cabinet had to quit  her job, only to be replaced by a man.Only five of the 23 full members of the Cabinet are women.  The Government might want to concentrate  on improving this balance before they lecture business any more.PHILIP HAMMOND and Michael Gove are clashing over the powers of the post-Brexit environmental regulator.The Environment Secretary wants it to have the  same power to hold the Government to account that the European Commission  has.  But the Chancellor is sceptical. Senior Treasury figures tell me he does not think it is sensible or necessary to continue these restraints post-Brexit.The dispute is causing some raised eyebrows. One Whitehall source describes it as part of the “constant war” between the pair.  The two obviously disagree on Brexit.But Hammond is also deeply unenthusiastic about Gove’s green agenda.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet neither defendant called for an ambulance.Adjourning the case, Judge Hancox told Herbert: The jury found you wilfully neglected [the child] in not seeking timely medical attention for him.This is an offence which can be punished by a sentence of imprisonment, but I am going to re-admit you to bail."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404165580-e1525706398972.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather latest bank holiday monday hottest ever","story":"Temperatures could hit 29C as hot air arrives from southern Russia -

No, these are the views of Labour’s Big Beasts on the Marxist puppet who stole their party.Brighty - The SunThursday’s local elections suggest Brexit will be the battlefield for the next election, with Labour alienating millions who voted Leave.Alastair Campbell and David Blunkett led the attack on Jeremy Corbyn, blaming him for allowing Jew-baiting anarchists and union paymaster Len McCluskey to kill Labour’s dream of power.“If we cannot beat this shambles of a Tory party, we don’t deserve to be in the game,” warned Tony Blair’s old spin doctor.Campbell, a ferocious Remainer, tore into Corbyn for missing open goals over Brexit, Windrush deportees, the Grenfell inferno and the never- ending NHS ­crisis.But he is especially appalled by Labour’s “Militant-style nastiness . . . anti-Semitism . . . and the feeling that some in the leader- ship feel greater animus against Labour supporters than the Tories.”Blunkett’s attack is even more personal. “Jeremy’s ­leadership is going nowhere,” he warns.The ex-Home Secretary blamed Corbyn directly for the wave of anti-Semitism that cost Labour dearly in London and the reign of terror against anyone who dared to speak out.“He could have cauterised the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader,” fumed Blunkett. “He has fudged and prevaricated.“I’ve seen the personal vitriol activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from Len McCluskey.“I’ve seen good Labour MPs traduced and insulted.”Such vicious public attacks from Blairite heroes make nonsense of pundits’ claims that nothing has changed since last week. Labour is in meltdown.Tories bracing themselves for humiliation on Thursday night were let off the hook. Labour’s retreat across swathes of ­Britain prove JC will never be PM. Labour should be 20 points ahead, not level-pegging.They are lumbered with their useless leader. The legion of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” fans adore him. And who would take over if he stepped aside?Not John McDonnell, for sure.This new blame game exposes the quiet but corrosive civil war tearing Labour apart since Jezza seized the crown.Last year, moderates had been secretly plotting a leadership coup on the assumption Labour would lose the General Election.That was before JC emerged startled but triumphant from Theresa May’s “strong and stable” fiasco.Now the knives are out. And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling? Good?’”This heatwave Bank Holiday is the perfect chance to try this experiment, chaps.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We really are becoming a bunch of snowflakes.Mrs Leigh claims she received a letter from Santanders executive complaints team urging her to not make remarks such as these in future calls.The letter from the banks executive complaints team read: Your call has been brought to our attention as the adviser, who was happy to help you with your inquiry, was offended by the comments made in respect of Bradford and its inhabitants.Santander considers great customer service a priority and we expect our staff to treat our customers with courtesy and respect at all times.In return we would expect our customers to afford our staff the same courtesy and sadly this was not the experience they had when you called.While I am sure you did not intend to cause offence, we would respectfully ask that during future calls you refrain from making remarks such as these.Should there be repeats of this behaviour when contacting us, we may have no option but to review our banking relationship with you and we may then decide it is in everyone’s interests for you to seek alternative banking arrangements.Santander said it followed procedures where staff can report inappropriate behaviour to a manager.A spokesman said: Our call handler was offended by comments they felt were racially inappropriate.We have spoken to Mrs Leigh and understand this was not her intention. We hope we can continue meeting Mrs Leighs banking needs.Bradfords ancient plumbing system means age-old buildings often dump waste into its subterranean becks, with some establishments having their washing-up pipes not yet directed to the sewer system.This meant that diligent staff cleaning their dishes were also flooding the Bradford Beck, a river which feeds into Yorkshires River Aire, with leftover curry.The city boasts 200 Asian restaurants and employs almost 100,000 in the industry.The large Asian population of the city is down to the demand for immigrants during the Industrial Revolution when the textile industry was thriving and Bradford needed more manpower."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000381027118.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"junior doctors job offers retracted","story":"Some candidates were given the wrong interview marks as data was moved between IT systems.The British Medical Association (BMA) said it was appalled to discover the blunder, and that it had caused extreme anxiety for trainees.The Royal College of Physicians blamed human error and will rerun the process from May 14.Some junior medics were due to start the jobs offered within months.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I weigh 190 pounds, and my cholesterol is 165,” he said. “I’m better than normal.”Gorske said he has eaten at least one Big Mac almost every day since May 17, 1972, and has kept the receipts to prove it. He made the Guinness World Records in 2016, after eating 28,788.He says he purchases six Big Macs on Monday, eats two on the spot and puts the rest in the refrigerator at home.“I don’t freeze them, I just put them in the fridge and take them out when I want one. I microwave them, I like them like that,” Gorske said.On Thursday, he buys eight and goes through the process again.Gorske said he does not get any special incentives from McDonald’s and pays the same price for his burgers as everyone else.“I don’t feel they owe me anything,” he said, adding that the owner of his local franchise is a “super nice guy trying to make a living.”He said the burgers make up about 90 percent of his diet.He also consumes at least one McDonald’s Fruit N’ Yogurt parfait a day.“My wife was at me to eat more fruits and vegetables, and the parfaits at my local store are only $1,” he said.Gorske said he “can’t remember” the last time he ate an apple or a banana.“Last year, I had some corn,” he said.Over the past 44 years, Gorske has only gone eight days in total without consuming a Big Mac.And on those days, it was because he had to do double shifts at his former job at Waupon Prison and couldn’t get out the door.“You can’t take Big Macs in front of the inmates,” he said.Gorske, who has thousands of Big Mac cartons in his home, said several people have suggested he suffers from a form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.But “it’s not a disorder at all,” he said. “Eating Big Macs doesn’t affect me as far as my health goes.

Women lack an enzyme in their stomach that breaks down alcohol into a safer compound.This is a mess, this is somebody who probably died of cirrhosis.What happens is not only are you unable to take toxins out of your system, which affects your brain - whats called encephalitic - but you cant build proteins.Your immune system doesnt work properly.And blood backs up behind the liver, building varicose veins in your oesophagus.They can rupture and you can bleed to death in minutes.The liver is the largest organ inside the body, and has around 500 different roles.It breaks down food into energy, helps the body get rid of dangerous waste products and toxins, and helps the immune system fight infections.Drinking alcohol increases your risk of liver disease, according to Drinkaware.Their website states: Drinking alcohol...can cause irreparable damage to this very important part of your body.In fact, alcohol is a major cause of the 25 per cent increase in deaths from liver disease in England over the last decade (from 9,231 in 2001 to 11,575 in 2009).There are two types of liver disease, acute - when it happens quickly over a few months - and chronic, where the damage is caused over a number of years.Cirrhosis is a chronic condition, that builds up over time.Earlier symptoms that could be a sign of cirrhosis include:Scientists dont know for sure why boozing harms the liver.But they have two theories.The first is that it causes oxidative stress, the chemical reaction that happens when the liver tries to break down alcohol.This damage can cause inflammation and scarring as the liver tries to repair itself.And the second way is to do with toxins in gut bacteria.Alcohol can damage our intestines, which lets toxins from the gut bacteria get into the liver.These toxins can also trigger inflammation and scarring, which in turn damages the liver.To find out more visit Drinkawares website here. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For this elite, Brexit’s a blind compulsion to reshape Britain as a deregulated, devil-take-the-hindmost Treasure Island for the globe’s footloose fattest cats. We’ve voted to leave Europe and their hatred of Parliament deciding where we go to is the smack of tinpot tyranny, not a love of democracy.

The cartoon showed the new Home Secretary at his desk, with the caption: ‘I just want to settle in, get organised, then deport my parents!’ Mr Javid, whose family came to the UK in the 1960s from Pakistan, messaged the former Labour minister on Twitter saying: Not like you Andrew Adonis. You’re better than this. The cartoon, drawn by Neil Kerber, was printed in the pro-Remain newspaper The New European. The editor of the newspaper Matt Kelly defended the cartoon saying it was a cartoon *about* racism - the racism that resulted in Windrush families being persecuted by a hostile Home Office.  But Mr Javid hit back saying that the didn\u0027t need the editor to explain racism to him. Many Twitter users criticised the Labour peer\u0027s decision to post the cartoon for \u0027racism\u0027 and also because Mr Javid\u0027s dad died in 2012. Piers Morgan described the image as disgustingly racist and pointed out that Mr Javid\u0027s father is dead so it was in particularly poor taste. Tory activist Amandeep Singh Bhogal described it as a disgraceful racist cartoon.   Mr Javid went on to share a tweet from a woman saying: Sajid I was using you as an example to a group of British Pakistani boys earlier this week who’ve disengaged from education to aim higher. These kind of comments do my work untold damage.  Mr Javid said: Please tell them not to be put off by the likes of Andrew Adonis. Encourage them to aim high. If you put in the hard work, you can achieve anything – regardless of background- in our great country.   Lord Adonis said later on Twitter: Sajid, on reflection I think the cartoon is too personal and in poor taste. I have deleted it. I am sorry. Andrew. He told talkRADIO\u0027s Julia Hartley-Brewer: Lord Adonis tells Julia: I do not think the cartoon is racist … I deleted it when Sajid said he was offended because of its personal nature.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lily allen refuses back down","story":"NewsLily Allen refuses to back down on claim that number of Grenfell fire victims was covered upShe is known for being outspoken about politics and is frequently abused on social media for her left-wing views\u0026nbspShareByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent12:32, 7 MAY 2018Updated12:44, 7 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLily Allen has refused to back down over claims the number of Grenfell dead has been covered up. The outspoken popstar, who lives near the disaster, claimed in the aftermath of the fire that \u0027off-the-record\u0027 figures given to police and fire crews put the number of victims at around 150, much higher than the official 71. Asked if accusing the government of lying over the death figures in the Grenfell disaster was an example of fake news she stuck by the claims. She said: I don’t know exactly how many people died, but I know what the general consensus in the community is, and that is that more people than have been accounted for died in Grenfell. Allen, who is known for being outspoken about politics and is frequently abused on social media for her left-wing views, gave a wide-ranging interview with the Observer in which celebrities including Jeremy Corbyn and members of the public submitted questions.  Following the fire in West London last June she told Channel 4\u0027s Jon Snow : I think what people would really like is a more honest count of how many people have actually died in this event. I have never in my entire life seen an event like this were the death count has been downplayed by the mainstream media. In the Observer interview she said: Do you acknowledge that the official police figures and fake news might not be separate things? The 33-year-old also told the Observer Britain was living under a fascist regime citing the Windrush scandal as an example. If everybody came together to fight these forces, then maybe we could stop this fascist regime we’re living under, she said.  In all seriousness, that’s what’s happening, isn’t it? I mean, sending British citizens “back” to the Commonwealth. It’s f**king disgusting. Asked by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn when she became politically engaged, she explained how the stillbirth of her son had affected her: my whole outlook on everything changed after that, she said.

There are also concerns about staff shortages, according to findings from Channel 4\u0027s Dispatches. The Department for Work and Pensions said it strongly disputed the claims from the extremely small, self-selected and flawed survey. Some 550 Public and Commercial Services Union members who work on Universal Credit for the DWP were polled for the programme.  Dispatches also uncovered cases of a disabled mother waiting five months to receive her full benefit entitlement, as well as a self-employed claimant being advised to give up work to receive more money.  A DWP whistleblower said: Sometimes we\u0027ll have a couple of people on our team on leave or off sick and then the work really piles up at that point and these claims have not been given the due attention they deserve. A lot of people can miss their payments ... It could mean that they won\u0027t be able to eat for another couple of days, it\u0027s very tough on them. Some 70% of staff polled said they felt the flagship welfare reform\u0027s roll-out should be stopped. A DWP spokeswoman said: We strongly dispute these claims entirely and this is an extremely small, self-selected and flawed survey that is unrepresentative of our staff delivering Universal Credit. The programme, due to air on Monday, will raise fresh concerns over the timeliness of payments, as well as highlighting examples of poor practice in the system.

Theresa Dolan, 35 says her son was seen by at least 20 doctors before he was given the right antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease - after being bitten by a tick roughly two and a half years ago.  Patrick Dolan suffered the bite in the family\u0027s garden in December 2015 at the age of three. Within a few days a bulls-eye rash appeared around the bite - symptom of the disease, which can cause liver damage and heart problems if not treatment promptly or with sufficient antibiotics. A week after the rash appeared the young boy suffered flu-like symptoms, his temperature soared and he experienced seizures.  Despite having three blood tests for Lyme disease, his mother says he is only now receiving the right dose of the antibiotic Amoxicillin. Patrick is receiving the antibiotic from a private Dublin-based consultant, and Theresa hopes it will giver her her little boy back. Over the past two years the five-year-old has suffered recurrent, extreme fevers, fatigue, tremors, breathing problems and joint paint. The family, from Howwood, Renfrewshire, has spent thousands on private healthcare, as well as having countless hospital trips and numerous admissions. They were living in Dubai when Patrick first became unwell. Mum-of-two Theresa, 35, who is a teacher, said: Patrick had come in with a bite but wasn\u0027t complaining about it.  It gradually got bigger and within a few days it was bulls eye rash. He was absolutely fine but within 10 days, he became very unwell with a high temperature. It was Christmas and he was barely interested in presents or Santa. The doctors there did a test for Lyme disease but weren\u0027t able to interpret it properly. They basically advised us to take him back to the UK. The family moved to Ireland, where dad Diarmaid, 34 and a mechanical engineer, is from and Patrick received six weeks of treatment for Lyme disease in December 2016. He seemed to improve but then in March and April last year started to suffer from erratic fevers for a few days at a time. The family moved back to Scotland in May last year and since then has been to A\u0026ampE at least four times.  Patrick is now receiving an intensive course of antibiotics from a private consultant in Dublin which his family hope will finally set him on the path to recovery. Theresa said: I don\u0027t know whether it\u0027s partly because they don\u0027t know enough about it but there seems to be an unwillingness by doctors to consider Lyme disease. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread to humans by a bite from an infected tick. The symptoms tend to start with a distinctive rash shaped like a bullseye. Not everyone gets one and this can make diagnosis tricky.

The force of the kick is evident by the loud noise it makes - and by the shocked reactions of witnesses.

His triumphant story is at odds with the low point he found himself at in December 1998 when, haunted by a traumatic past, he decided to try and end it all. The jump off a bridge over the A34 would break nearly every bone in his body but he miraculously survived. It was while being treated for the catastrophic injuries that Michael decided he would NOT let the bullies win and that he would make a success of his life.   Michael, now 42, told the Manchester Evening News : “That was the turning point of my life. I thought - I want to be a success, I want to live, I want to help other young people. Why should I let other people finish me off?  “I gave in to the bullies by jumping off that bridge. You should never give in to bullies.”  From that point on, Michael worked hard to build a multi-million-pound business, and he has proudly raised an incredible \u0026pound3.4m for Childline and the NSPCC over the past 15 years.  He was awarded the MBE by the Queen in 2016 for his services to charity, and now he is planning his own charity ball to continue his fundraising drive in June at Manchester’s Hilton Hotel.  He describes his childhood as “hell” after the death of his mother when he was aged just 11. Despite his tumultuous existence, being passed from different care homes, he enrolled himself in college at 16 to get a BTEC in business and finance, and got a job working in the import and export business, showing natural flair. But away from work his mental health continued to suffer - particularly as he then struggled to come to terms with his own sexuality - and he spiralled out of control. It led him, in the early hours of December 28, to head to the bridge over the dual carriageway with plans to end his life.

The two pictures, which were taken by mum Kate Middleton, were shared around the worlds within seconds of going live. But eagle-eyed fans were quick to notice something familiar about the two photos - the clothes. It seems thrifty Kate is using some of her fashion recycling magic on her children as well, as we\u0027ve seen both the outfits before.  The little white jumper Louis is wearing in the photo of him on his own is the same one big sister Charlotte wore in her first official photos. We can\u0027t see exactly as the old photo of Charlotte was cropped, but it looks like he\u0027s wearing the same little bottoms as well.

New mum Michelle Hands, 33, first got into the building industry after university when she took on a summer job as a quality assurance engineer and fell in love with the job. But four years ago Michelle decided she wanted to take a more hands-on approach and delved into the world of heavy civil engineering - more often than not as the only woman on a building site.  A far cry from her teenage dreams of being an actress, Michelle says working in construction is the perfect job despite a constant battle against sexism - and some men even refusing to work with her.   When the freelance project manager and her university lecturer hubby Tom Quarmby, 34, found out they were expecting a baby last year, Michelle worried about how the builders on her team would react. But the mum of one had a refreshingly positive response and her colleagues helped out when Michelle needed to step back from the more physical aspects of her role to keep her baby safe. Since giving birth to Archie Quarmby 12 weeks ago, Michelle has decided to share her experience as a pregnant construction worker and the feat of \u0027building two things at once\u0027 to inspire women and girls. Michelle, of Leeds said: Tom and I were so excited when we found out I was pregnant but I was dreading the idea of breaking the news to the team. I wasn\u0027t sure how it would be received or if I would be let go straight away. Being self-employed there\u0027s no maternity pay so I needed a plan. Wearing big high-vis clothes I could hide my baby bump for a little while while I decided what to do. It was definitely noted that I was using the porter loo more often. I\u0027m pretty sure everyone noticed that I was eating for England as well. I would come in with a packed lunch and it would all be gone by 9am.  I broke the news to everyone at the 14-week mark. I was conscious of it from a health and safety point of view and obviously for the safety of my baby and myself, it was coming to the point where I couldn\u0027t keep doing all the physical side of my job. Everyone took it really well. They told me to keep working for as long as I wanted to and loads of the guys I work with have families so they were really excited for me. I did get the occasional comment pulling me up on stuff if I was suffering a case of baby brain but I would just come back with \u0027I\u0027m building two things at once\u0027 and they couldn\u0027t say anything else. It was the best response. Last year was actually my first project management role and we were building a retail park. I did it all while pregnant so my hormones were all over the place but I just got on with it and did my job. At the time I didn\u0027t see it as anything special but when I got to the end of the project I thought \u0027wow, people say women can\u0027t do this and can\u0027t do that but we can\u0027. It was never easy project managing, engineering and building a tiny human at the same time. But I am so glad I battled through to prove that women shouldn\u0027t be scared to commit to a career in construction for fear of also wanting to become a mum at some point. As long as you take care of yourself physically and keep a stress-free mind, it can be done. I hope sharing my experience shows girls out there that you can be both a mother and engineer.  After finishing a geography degree, Michelle was struggling to decide on her next step as she knew she would \u0027never survive\u0027 a desk job. When a friend recommended an environmental job working alongside a construction company, Michelle decided to give it a go. What was meant to be a temporary stint liaising between construction companies, their clients and the environmental agency soon turned into a 10-year career as Michelle loved the seasonal nature of the work. In the three to six months of the year she wasn\u0027t working, Michelle dedicated her time to travelling around the world with Tom and pursuing her passion of film-making and photography. A lover of the outdoors and a sociable work environment, Michelle decided to delve more into the engineering and construction side of the building industry in 2014 and hasn\u0027t looked back. Stepping onto building sites dominated by men and their \u0027pack mentality\u0027, Michelle has faced more than her fair share of obstacles with some male colleagues telling her \u0027women don\u0027t belong in construction\u0027.  Not always on the receiving end of the sexist remarks, Michelle has also witnessed the catcalling and crude comments towards other women that builders are renowned for and feels it is her duty to make a difference. As an engineer and project manager, Michelle surveys the sites, marks out the plots by hammering giant pegs into the ground with a sledge hammer and manages the construction process. While she certainly stands out at just 5ft 5ins and 9st, Michelle has fought to prove she can pull her weight - both mentally and physically - on any building site. And Michelle, who is determined to inspire girls to pursue their dream job even if it defies feminine stereotypes, says she is ever grateful to her parents Brian Hands, 59, and Margaret Hands, 60, for supporting her career choice. Michelle said: I\u0027m very sociable. I like meeting different people every day and being outdoors. Engineering is the perfect mix of both, it\u0027s great. Don\u0027t get me wrong, there are times when it\u0027s the middle of winter and I\u0027m stuck out on a building site and I curse myself but during the summer it\u0027s beautiful. Like any job you take the rough with the smooth. Eighty per cent of the time it is the best job in the world but it hasn\u0027t been easy. I work in a heavily male dominated field and I do get sexist comments. I\u0027ve had people ask me if I\u0027d rather be behind the counter at Boots and tell me women don\u0027t belong in construction. I\u0027ve even had architects refuse to work with a female engineer.

Speaking to the Daily Mail , former Household Cavalry guardsman James Wharton said Prince Harry felt very relaxed with his fellow soldiers.  He said: He told us the tale, all the details. However James is loyal to his friend and would not reveal any of the personal information. He continued: It\u0027s not especially interesting, but I\u0027m keeping it to myself.  More details of Prince Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding were revealed last week.  Kensington Palace announced Meghan\u0027s dad Thomas will walk her down the aisle on her big day, but her mum Doria will travel in the car to the church with her.   It\u0027s the latest in a number of royal traditions the couple have broken for their wedding , which will take place at Windsor Castle on May 19.

Chris Roberts explained how he was the driver of a VW Golf GTi struck by a Ford Fiesta coming round a bend on Saturday. The footage from Mr Roberts’ dashcam shows his car travelling along the country road seconds before the impact with the Ford Fiesta travelling in the opposite direction. The weather conditions were excellent - and there was nothing to suggest what was about to happen. Mr Roberts\u0027 car - travelling behind a blue car - drives towards the bend on his side of the road.  As he approaches the bend a white car comes around it normally - but it is swiftly folllowed by a second white car, the Ford Fiesta, which swerves into his path. Mr Roberts has no time to react - and the car smashes into his. The camera stops running with a view of an apparently cracked windscreen.  Mr Roberts was rushed to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary by ambulance with leg injuries, the Huddersfield Examiner reports.  The driver of the Ford Fiesta was airlifted by the Yorkshire Air Ambulance and taken to Leeds General Infirmary with several suspected fractures. Firefighters from Huddersfield Fire Station attended the incident, which happened shortly after 2pm.

Naveed Sadiq booked a last minute week-long holiday in Turkey for himself and wife Adila Mushtaq with the firm at its Fort Shopping Park branch in Birmingham last Saturday. The couple were meant to fly out on holiday on Sunday - and claim they had requested in advance access to a segregated pool for religious reasons - but after realising Mr Sadiq\u0027s wife would only have access to a communal pool, they then requested a refund. Mr Sadiq claims he was marched out of the store when he started recording the conversation with staff on his mobile phone.  And he claims he was locked out of the branch by staff, with his wife still inside the shop, Birmingham Live reports.   It was a bit of an extreme reaction, to say the least, said Mr Sadiq, who has since been offered a full refund. It\u0027s not as if I was aggressive or violent. I was simply stating that I had been mis-sold something and I wanted my money back. Mr Sadiq claims he booked the holiday with the assurance from staff that his wife would have access to a segregated pool. I booked the holiday as a last minute treat for my wife because I work long hours and I wanted to spend some time with her, Mr Sadiq said. We are Muslim, so we specifically requested a segregated pool for my wife. My wife was keen to book at a store, rather than online or over the phone, so she could have that added assurance. When we booked it at the Fort branch, we were given assurances that we would have a segregated pool.  But after we had booked, we actually realised this was not the case. So we went back to the store for a refund. We were only offered an upgrade, which we would have to have paid more money to. The holiday already cost me \u0026pound1,200 and I was not prepared to pay any more. I simply asked for a refund and was not happy with the response. Mr Sadiq said he was told he would have to apply in writing for a refund and could have to wait up to 28 days for a response. They already had \u0026pound1,200 of my money and we had lost out on our holiday, he said.

British bridegroom Jamie Fox and his bride-to-be were canoeing in the Zambezi river above the Victoria Falls when the giant beast struck from below. Former national tennis player Zanele Ndlovu had her right arm torn off and her left hand bitten in the vicious attack.  Jamie went to her rescue and managed to save her but she was losing so much blood it was feared she may die from the wound. A family friend said: During the attack the crocodile gripped her arm and ripped it off while her partner made frantic efforts to save her. They are lucky to be alive. “The boats used in that activity are inflated and the crocodile attacked their vessel and in the process deflated it before attacking her.  A make-shift tourniquet was applied and she was rushed to hospital where surgeons managed to save her life but she lost most of her arm. Incredibly despite her horrific injuries she was determined not to miss her wedding day and was allowed to use the hospital chapel to get married. A Minister presided over the ceremony at the Mater Dei Hospital in Bulawayo where the remarkable service took place on Sunday. It is believed the couple had gone to the Victoria Falls to get married but the crocodile attack meant a drastic change of venue was needed. The bride can be seen in her white sleeveless wedding dress walking into church with her stump heavily bandaged, holding pink roses in her left hand.  As Jamie places the wedding ring on her left hand a canula can be seen attached to her wrist and her hand is also heavily bandaged. When she signed the register, a huge round of applause broke out from family and friends. A witness said: It is a quite remarkable love story and it really does show their love for each other. The crocodile attack made no difference. “Their feelings and love for each other are even stronger than before if anything. A short video clip from the ceremony shows the emotional moment the groom kisses the bride.

Jenna Thompson, 31, was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis after hundreds of trips to her GP around 13 years ago. The painful condition, which causes her bladder to swell up, often leaves her totally unable to walk or stand up.  In her own words, Jenna, a journalist for the Hull Daily Mail , spoke about her life living with the debilitating condition.   I was 18 and at a music festival when I first noticed something was wrong. For those of you who have ever had cystitis, you will know the symptoms are unmistakeable: that urgent, desperate need to go to the toilet RIGHT NOW, and the burning pain that comes with a trip to the loo. It’s horrible to feel that way when you’re in the comfort of your home, but at a festival, where you’re sleeping in a tent, and the only toilet available is a dirty Portaloo, is not an ideal place to be suffering. After trying to tough it out, I eventually gave up and went home early. Usually a bout of this unpleasant infection can be cleared with plenty of water and some antibiotics. But for me, it was the start of an illness that has lasted 13 years so far and will likely be with me for the rest of my life. Despite antibiotics, lashings of water and a tonne of cranberry juice (which I would later realise has the opposite effect on my condition), the symptoms simply didn’t budge. In fact, they got worse. Doctors were sympathetic but just kept handing me dozens of different antibiotics to try and find the one that would cure me. Little did they and I know that nothing would. At the height of my illness, I was pretty much housebound and going to the toilet up to 60 times a day. Each time I went it would sting and burn, but that pain was nothing compared to the feeling in my bladder as it (sort of) filled up a deeply uncomfortable pressure that makes it almost impossible to sit down or walk, interspersed with stabbing, sharp bursts of pain that took my breath away.  It took two years of these symptoms and hundreds of trips to the GP and hospital – including some extremely painful tests and exploratory surgery - before I was given a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis (or IC, sometimes referred to as painful bladder syndrome). A chronic, long-term condition, the NHS describes IC as “poorly understood bladder condition that causes long-term pelvic pain and problems with urination” that can have “a significant impact on your lifestyle, work, emotional health and relationships”. Perhaps it is poorly understood because, as with anything relating to going to the toilet, people don’t talk about it very much. The only time I have seen any mention of it in the media was a short segment on Embarrassing Bodies (which really makes you feel better…) and an article on a national newspaper website which described it as simply cystitis (it is so much more complicated than that). Bladder Health UK says “bladder conditions can be seen as ‘socially unacceptable’ which are not often discussed in public”. It suggests this can lead to social isolation among sufferers. I understand people’s reluctance to talk about it. I have been a journalist for more than 10 years now and my natural instinct is to write about things, but it has taken a long time for me to be able to find the confidence to speak about it publicly.

The verbal heckling was captured on mobile phone by the musicians who filmed their encounter with recruitment boss Matthew Morehead in a street in Lichfield, Staffs, on Friday. The footage, which one of the buskers posted on Facebook, begins with the row already underway - and with Mr Morehead apparently objecting to the group performing their music in the street near his offices and \u0027how bad they are\u0027. When he realises he is being filmed he leans into the camera and says: My name is Matthew Morehead and I run TRSG. We are a recruitment agency and what we do is we put people to work. One of the buskers off camera interrupts him and says: Bully people... you bully people!  Mr Morehead replies: No, we go to work and pay our tax. The squabble soon turns into a heated row as the volume increases. As voices become raised, Mr Morehead proclaims: I can be louder, I\u0027m ex-Special Forces. My voice is louder than yours! These people... they are not going to pay tax, they are going to ruin your lives and also probably, from the sound of it, try and cause people a problem with their business. People pay money to be here - not to sit here and scrounge off everybody else! Again off camera, one of the buskers can be heard to insist: We\u0027re not scrounging!  Mr Moorhead replies: Yes you are - scrounger... Four of you and not one of you has got a real job. One of the musicians then points out that one of the group Mr Morehead is referring to had served with the Armed Forces for 16 years. Mr Morehead then turns to speak to the busker in question and asks him: What unit was you with? The busker replied: I was in the Marines. Mr Morehead replies abruptly: Well I\u0027m ex-9th Squadron Airborne. - before then apparently offering to help him find a job. Mr Morehead tells the man: So, do you want to stay here with these kind of losers mate? (unintelligible) ...they wouldn\u0027t deal with these kind of d****. Another busker replies: The only one being a d*** is you.  Mr Morehead replies: (Unintelligible) ...I\u0027m not afraid of little girls like you... you can\u0027t get a real job! The row descends into chaos - with Mr Morehead condemning the buskers for \u0027swearing around children\u0027 in the street - before becoming even more bizarre. As Mr Morehead moves away, one of the musicians strikes up a song - singing with the first line: I\u0027m a bully... Mr Morehead replies singing his own words: I\u0027m a waster with a life! At this point one of the buskers uses the advantage of his microphone and speaker volume to call Mr Morehead an absolute f****** moron! Then another row about swearing in front of children breaks out. One of the buskers later told MirrorOnline that Mr Morehead has since apologised and has offered to make a \u0026pound200 donation to charity. The group claimed the row started when Mr Morehead became angered by performances staged outside his office in Lichfield city centre - and alleged that he tried to surreptitiously obtain his details to complain to the council and threatened to destroy his equipment before the camera started rolling.  The buskers included Joshua Sole and Gary Conway - who both regularly gig around the West Midlands. In a Facebook video uploaded today, Joshua said: This guy came storming out asking for my details. What he said was \u0027hi mate I think you\u0027re really good can I have your details for weddings\u0027. I was like yeah here\u0027s my name and then he went aaah you f****** idiot. Now I\u0027m going to report you to the police because you didn\u0027t give your details to the council. I work there and you\u0027ve been disrupting my f****** business all day and next time I\u0027m going to smash your amp up with 30 of my mates. Joshua claimed he received a message from Mr Morehead on Sunday in which he apologised and offered to pay \u0026pound200 to a charity of the musicians\u0027 choosing after reflecting on his behaviour. He said Mr Morehead claimed he had been abused online since the video surfaced.

Graduates spoke of feeling \u0027embarrassed and degraded to be handled in that manner\u0027 - and many complained it was only black students who were pushed by the white, male usher. The university has since issued an apology insisting they are proud of all their students - and it is understood an investigation into the incident has been launched. Video footage of the controversial incident clearly shows a man grabbing students as they happily dance on stage, pushing them out of sight.   Garcia-Wilde told Gainesville the black students were pushed more \u0027aggressively\u0027.  He said his friends wanted to celebrate by \u0027strolling\u0027, which he described as a cultural tradition in historically black fraternities and sororities. “I was actually too afraid because I saw him shove other people, he said. “But my two friends who graduated with me really wanted to do it, so they tried. They both were pushed and one of them got an entire bear hug.”       Oliver Telusma, 21, who studies political science, was one of his friends who was manhandled. “I had just started, and he picked me up and turned me around, which I thought was kind of embarrassing and degrading to be handled in that manner,” he said. He added that although many might say the actions were not racially motivated, he feels the university has made black people feel unsafe.  Others felt this was not the case, with one social media user called Tasha saying: University of Florida did not target black students or enthusiastic students, they went after flamboyant students. I feel a certain decorum should be kept at a grad ceremony. It\u0027s not prom. That being said, it\u0027s not WWE either.  W. Kent Fuchs, the university\u0027s 12th president tweeted an apology. He said: During one of this weekend’s commencement ceremonies, we were inappropriately aggressive in rushing students across the stage. I personally apologize, and am reaching out to the students involved.

You\u0027ve had to endure months of cold, dark, rainy morning commutes to work - followed by cold, dark, rainy evening commutes home from work. So when we get a bit of sunshine it\u0027s only natural that it should change our whole outlook on life: tops come off, music blares and we get lairy at 4pm after a few pints in the sun. This weekend has seen glorious weather across the whole of the UK - and this could be the warmest Bank Holiday in years.  Here are 21 things British people are guilty of doing at the first sign of sunshine Recognise yourself or any of your friends in this? 1. Talk about the weather non-stop Oh my god, I just can\u0027t believe how sunny it is! Can you believe how warm it is? It was cold this time last week!   Good chat. 2. Drink in the daytime - just because you can You might not head to the pub at 3pm in miserable weather, but sunshine means you can have a beer, cider or G\u0026ampT in the afternoon and not feel guilty.  You also find yourself going \u0027for one\u0027 after work. As the evenings are lighter, you end up staying out much longer than planned. 3. Blast music from cars Craig David tracks blaring from your car windows in October would earn you some strange looks.   But when the sun\u0027s out it becomes perfectly acceptable to turn your vehicle into a mobile boombox. 4. Sun\u0027s out? Guns out! There\u0027s something about the start of the British summer that makes men think they\u0027re on a lads\u0027 holiday in Ibiza - when they\u0027re actually just walking around the local shops.  It\u0027s not that hot. Put your shirt back on. 5. Complain about the weather I can\u0027t stop sneezing and it\u0027s just too hot for me. I can\u0027t wait for winter, I\u0027m more of a winter person.   In a few months you will take this back and have a moan about how cold it is. 6. Rush to an ice cream van Is there anything more British than a wafer cone, soft-serve ice cream and a Flake?  If the sun\u0027s out and you hear that music playing, you\u0027ll be running to the van just like you did when you were a kid. 7. Complain that a 99 flake doesn\u0027t cost 99p anymore  How much!? In my day they were 99p! Yes, the price has gone up quite a bit since the 1990s, when you could bag this treat for under a quid. Inflation, we hate you. 8. Spontaneously decide to have a BBQ Ah, what a wonderful idea. Let\u0027s all rush to the nearest Asda and buy as much bread and meat as possible.  There\u0027s no way we\u0027ll be able to eat it all, but it\u0027ll be nice to dine outside - BECAUSE WE CAN. 9. Remember you have no idea how to light the barbecue It\u0027s been so long since you last used it, your barbecue has gone a bit rusty and you can\u0027t for the life of you remember how to get it going.   Half an hour (and half a newspaper) later, you\u0027ve managed to produce some tiny flames. Great success. 10. End up eating inside because it\u0027s raining It took you so long to get the grill hot enough to cook with that the heavens have now opened and your buns are getting all soggy.  You end up eating your burgers on the sofa anyway while the nominated chef takes refuge under an umbrella in the garden. 11. Descend on the nearest beach  Because sunbathing when it\u0027s still so cool you have to wear a jumper is a really good look. 12. Forget the sea is freezing here  You head for a paddle, then realise that our waters definitely weren\u0027t made for swimming - unless you have a wetsuit to keep you warm. You retreat to your towel, defeated. 13. Get your pasty legs out Who wears short shorts? Everyone, apparently. Cue the annual contest to wear as little fabric as possible to maximise on your leg tan opportunities.  After all, you\u0027ve been wearing tights, leggings and jeans all winter, so you\u0027re looking pretty pale. Oh and if you\u0027re not wearing something that resembles a denim belt, you\u0027re not doing it properly. 14. This.  No explanation necessary. 15. Sunbathe in the front garden You wouldn\u0027t usually sit on your front door step, half-clothed, in full view of all your neighbours. But when your house is facing the wrong way and it\u0027s the only place you can soak up some rays, you\u0027ve got to do what you\u0027ve got to do.   16. Realise you missed a spot  When putting on sun cream, there\u0027s always that hard-to-reach place on your body that means you end up with oddly-shaped sunburn marks like this one when you fall asleep in the garden. Stay safe in the sun, people. 17. Leave your coat at home Because you \u0027don\u0027t need it anymore\u0027. Soon you are cursing that cool breeze and then hating yourself when the sun goes down and you\u0027re shivering.   18. Post arty pictures of sunshine and cocktails on social media   You know, just to make your friends jealous that you\u0027ve got such a great, summery social life. 19. Got a convertible? That top is coming down  Been waiting all winter for that one sunny day when you can enjoy the perks of your convertible car? Doesn\u0027t feel like such a perk when you\u0027re freezing and your hair is getting messed up. 20. Head straight to the nearest park  Usually with a ball or frisbee. If you\u0027re organised, you\u0027ll remember to take a picnic blanket to sit on so you can avoid the dreaded grass-stains-on-bum situation. 21. Remember that you have allergies  Parks and daisy chains probably aren\u0027t the best thing to be around right now - and you have no idea where your packet of hayfever meds from last year has gone. If you\u0027ve got any more to add to the list, tweet them @YourMirror or email yourmirror@mirror.

The paedophile encouraged his two daughters and son, aged between five and 10, to have sex with each other and him. He also raped his six-year-old daughter and abused one of the girls in the bathroom in their family home on Christmas Day 2016. The dad, in his 40s, was jailed for eight years after pleading guilty to four counts of rape and 15 counts of indecent assault at Mackay District Court in Queensland, Australia, on Wednesday.  He often carried out his attacks, between 2013 and 2017, when his life left for work, reports the Daily Mercury . The sick dad was caught when the babysitter spotted him inappropriately touching his daughter in the kitchen and informed his wife. The paedophile, who cannot be named for legal reasons, would let the children watch Frozen on an iPad as a \u0027reward\u0027 and threaten to beat his son with a stick and a belt as a punishment, said prosecutor Andrew Walklate. He continued: He not only abused them, but he encouraged them into a position where what became a normal activity for them was to engage in a process of sexual adventure with him, if I can put it in that way.

The Egyptian Antiquities Ministry said in a statement yesterday that months of studies by Italy\u0027s Polytechnic University in Turin has shown that no area exists. Mostafa Waziri, Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said: The studies have shown that no chambers exist, or even an indication that any threshold or door frames, which contradicts the previous theory that had assumed the existence of passages or chambers adjacent or inside the burial chamber of King Tutankhamun. Experts have been divided over the existence of a concealed room behind the tomb, which some believe could be the final resting place of the lost Queen, Nefertiti.  There is huge international interest in Nefertiti, who died in the 14th century B.C. and is thought to be Tutankhamun\u0027s stepmother. Any confirmation of her final resting place would be the most remarkable Egyptian archaeological find so far this century.

Standing in the Grand Kremlin Palace\u0027s ornately-decorated Andreyevsky Hall with his hand on a gold-embossed copy of the constitution, Putin swore to serve the Russian people, safeguard their rights and freedoms, and defend Russian sovereignty. Putin was inaugurated for his fourth term as president two months after more than 70% of voters backed him in a presidential election in which he had no serious challengers. His most dangerous opponent, Alexei Navalny, was barred from running in that vote and on Saturday Navalny and hundreds of his supporters were detained by police while protesting over Putin\u0027s new term under the slogan: Putin is not our tsar.  Putin, who is 65, embarks on his fourth term in office buoyed by widespread popular support but weighed down by a costly confrontation with the West, a fragile economy and uncertainty about what happens when his term ends. The Russian constitution bars him from running again when his new terms ends in 2024. Putin has been in power, either as president or prime minister, since 2000. When his fourth term ends he will be Moscow\u0027s longest-serving leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.  Navalny called for demonstrations against Putin in almost 100 cities and towns.  Navalny asked his supporters during Saturday\u0027s protest: They said that this city belongs to Putin. Is that right? Do you need a tsar? he asked, eliciting a collective roar of No. Footage showed five policemen hauling him to a waiting van by his arms and legs, a scene that was repeated dozens of times with his supporters. In total it is thought roughly 1,600 people were detained by police during the protests.  Another opposition politician, Ilya Yashin, said police planned to charge Navalny with disobeying a police officer. The penalty for such an offence, if repeated, can be a fine and up to 30 days in jail. Navalny, who has been detained and jailed numerous times for organising similar protests, said he was proud to have made it to the rally. "}]
