Anyone can get infected with the virus — technically called SARS-CoV-2.But eight months since the pandemic began in China, doctors around the world are still baffled as to why youngsters appear resistant to the disease.  Mr Ryan said young people were often also reticent in giving their details or disclosing friends\u0027 names to contact tracers. \u0027It\u0027s tough but it is what is needed to stop the virus,\u0027 he said. Even in Geneva, where the global UN health body is based, cabarets and clubs were closed last week after evidence that nearly half of new cases were coming from there. Swiss newspapers said that in one night club in Zurich, from which several coronavirus cases emerged recently, partygoers had given fake names including \u0027Donald Duck\u0027.WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said that as well as reducing risks to others, young people should be more careful as even a mild version of the disease might have long-term consequences.It was announced earlier today that the global Covid-19 related death toll had topped 788,000 as dozens of countries reintroduced tighter regulations in a bid to stop the spread of the deadly virus. However, at the beginning of July Chancellor Rishi Sunak warned that a generation of young people risked being \u0027lost\u0027 to the coronavirus unless the public started spending in pubs and restaurants.Mr Sunak asked Britons to \u0027eat out to help out\u0027 in a bid to boost the economy and avoid a jobs meltdown that will hit the young hardest.He said he feared that the younger generation would otherwise be \u0027scarred by coronavirus\u0027. He told the Times: \u0027This is a consumption-driven economy people used to, three months ago, go out with their friends or family to go and have a meal or buy a car, or upgrade their house, or move house.\u0027Mr Sunak added that it was important to get \u0027the next few bits right\u0027 in order to save the younger generation\u0027s jobs and lifestyles.The Bank of England\u0027s chief economist Andy Haldane predicted this week that Britain was headed for a V-shaped recovery.Addressing the comments, the chancellor said \u0027we all want Andy to be right\u0027 but conceded some hardship was inevitable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46388c8d289aac05ccd8bf407c33463ec2536a6b/0_47_3456_2074/master/3456.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03f35905638794c6fd11cebc23c633ea","title":"magnum suspends photographer david alan harvey over harassment claim","story":"A photographer at the centre of complaints that the renowned Magnum Photos agency was hosting historical images that may represent child sexual exploitation has been suspended over a separate allegation of harassing a female colleague.Magnum’s board voted unanimously to suspend the veteran US photographer David Alan Harvey after a board member was approached confidentially with the complaint.The agency, which has never expelled a member, will not represent Harvey or his archive while an investigation into the complaint is carried out.“A formal investigation is being carried out and David Alan Harvey’s membership has been suspended whilst this process takes place. Magnum is committed to a safe work environment and we will fairly and thoroughly investigate allegations of improper conduct by photographers or staff.”Last week Magnum was embroiled in controversy over some of Harvey’s images in its archive, dating to the late 1980s, documenting sex workers in Thailand.On the basis of the tagging of some of the images, including suggestions that those pictured were potentially minors, critics alleged that some pictures depicted sexually exploited children. understands that in his contacts with the agency since the controversy blew up, Harvey has denied that is what his pictures show.  has contacted Harvey for comment on both issues.The allegation of harassment comes as the still largely male-dominated world of professional photography has been struggling to get to grips with complaints levelled at leading agencies and prominent photographers.In 2018 Antonín Kratochvíl resigned from the high-profile VII agency after a report in the Columbia Journalism Review accused him of harassing and intimidating female colleagues, an allegation Kratochvíl denied.The article by Kristen Chick was the result of interviews with 50 women in the photography industry, and accused agencies, publications and institutions of turning a blind eye to abusive behaviour.Magnum’s digital archive has been offline since the Thailand allegations emerged and is being prepared to be relaunched minus Harvey’s work for now.Magnum’s president, Olivia Arthur, said last week the agency had begun an “in-depth internal review to make sure that we fully understand the implications of the work in the archive, both in terms of imagery and context”.She said: “Recently, we have been alerted to historical material in our archive that is problematic in terms of imagery, captioning or key wording and we are taking this extremely seriously.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0beb404a0b4e134a1108e884cc1c8c87ecb0ee8d/270_308_4927_2956/master/4927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4ce9450bb208fd3fdeded40365aa609","title":"alien invasions and corrupt cops the history of ec comics in pictures","story":"Bill Gaines revolutionised the 1950s comics industry with EC Comics’ taboo-busting crime tales, stupendous sci-fi plots … and war stories that didn’t flinch from the truth "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19b8646b51d104767cf7bd5234f6f7fd3d5114c1/0_222_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfa2a3e3114f1357ef423c2f9a28a0aa","title":"australian greens want power sharing agreement with labor if theres a hung parliament","story":"Adam Bandt warns the ALP’s current public dispute over climate policy only helps the CoalitionAdam Bandt has challenged Labor not to hinder the Greens when they attempt to take inner-city seats from the Liberals, and says the Greens want a power-sharing agreement if the next election delivers a hung parliament.In an interview ahead of the Greens’ special national conference on Saturday, Bandt says it is possible that the next federal election could deliver a similar result to the one in 2010, where Labor had to form government with the support of the crossbench, and Anthony Albanese had to manage the passage of legislation through the lower house without a majority.“The parliament is very finely balanced,” the Greens leader said. “There is going to be a redistribution before the next election. Victoria is going to gain another seat, other states will potentially lose seats. There’s a very real prospect of another minority parliament at the next election, it would only take a very small swing to get another minority parliament and another potential power-sharing arrangement. I think there’s a very real prospect of a repeat of what we had 10 years ago.“The Greens are up for a power-sharing arrangement with Labor, the question is, is Labor? At the moment Labor is trying to work out where it stands on some core issues, like climate and gas and coal – so perhaps they first have to resolve some of those internal debates.”Bandt says the current public dispute between the shadow resources minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, and the shadow climate change and energy minister, Mark Butler, over climate policy “only helps the Coalition”.Fitzgibbon, who thinks Labor is failing to reach its traditional blue-collar constituency because its policy offering on climate action is too progressive, this week suggested Labor could split in the future if it fails to reconcile its two constituencies.Bandt said that dispute would keep Scott Morrison in government. “I think the days of Labor trying to walk both sides of the fence by saying one thing to the Australian and another thing to the  are over – the internet exists,” he told  Australia. “People are able to see through that fence-sitting.“I want to see the government turfed out at the next election. Labor trying to walk both sides of the street gets in the way of trying to turf the Coalition out.Asked whether the Greens were prepared to not challenge Labor-held seats in the inner city as a goodwill gesture to facilitate the power-sharing he says he wants, Bandt said the Greens would always reserve the right to target seats where there was a solid progressive constituency.But he said his party had deliberately targeted Liberal-held seats in recent times. He said rather than conducting a turf war in the inner city, Labor should not impede efforts by the Greens to take Liberal seats.“At the last election, the Greens were campaigning strongly in seats like Kooyong and Higgins and we had our sights set on winning those Liberal-held seats, then Labor, for reasons only known to them, decided to switch candidates in Higgins at the last minute, putting a huge amount of resources into the seat, and started attacking the Greens and as a result, they erted resources from places like Chisholm,” he said.“Perhaps in hindsight, it wasn’t a great idea to come after the Greens when the Greens were coming after the Liberals. I think there’s some questions for everyone to ask going into the next election.“There’s at least one more summer before the next election and possibly two. The climate crisis has not gone away and what we found over the last summer, whether you live in the seat of Higgins or Kooyong, or Melbourne or McNamara, people are not that far away from each other and when the smoke is so thick you can’t drop your kids off to childcare everyone feels it, no matter who they are voting for.“Increasingly, as the climate crisis presses itself, and the hit on young people and women from the coronavirus crisis continues to be felt, more and more people will look to the Greens, so we will continue to campaign in those seats.“Perhaps Labor needs to have a bit of a think about whether when the Greens are campaigning against Liberals, whether they want to help or hinder us? We think there is real opportunity for some of those inner-city Liberal seats to turn Green as the climate crisis hits.”Bandt says he has a good relationship with the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, that was forged in the minority parliament in 2010, when Albanese was the leader of the house and managed the legislative agenda for Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd. “Obviously we have had tussles. Sometimes we try and win the same seats, we’ve been campaigning against each other, but there’s a level of respect, even though we have different views,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1ec4fd169070ce450971857d47ac0246e7fcad3/202_457_3024_1815/master/3024.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0b14f77b4e5c6a603dc9434569614833","title":"tesco blackmail trial farmer nigel wright convicted spiking baby food blackmail plot","story":"Nigel Wright found guilty of contaminating three jars with metal shards in extortion plotA sheep farmer is facing a “lengthy custodial sentence” after being convicted of planting baby food laced with metal shards in stores as part of a long-running blackmail plot against Tesco.Nigel Wright, 45, deliberately contaminated jars of Heinz baby food and sent dozens of letters and emails to the supermarket giant in an attempt to extort £1.4m in bitcoin in a two-year campaign.One draft letter read: “Imagine a baby’s mouth cut open and blood pouring out, or the inside of their bellies cut and bleeding. You pay, you save them.”Claiming to be part of a cohort of farmers angry at the low price of milk, he warned jars would also be contaminated with salmonella, white powder and knives.Tesco was forced to issue a product recall of 42,000 jars after contaminated products were found in two stores in Lockerbie and Rochdale.Morven Smith, in Lockerbie, had already fed a few spoonfuls of Heinz sweet and sour chicken to her 10-month-old baby when she spotted “something shiny” in the bowl and pulled it out in December 2019. She said: “It was horrendous. I felt sick, I was so shocked.”Wright was caught on CCTV placing a tampered jar on a Tesco shelf, before buying a bottle of wine, more jars of baby food and flowers for his wife, a primary school teacher.A second mother, Harpreet Kaur-Singh, in Rochdale, later told Tesco she had binned two jars of baby food – Heinz Sunday chicken dinner and a jar of cheesy pasta stars – after discovering metal while feeding her nine-month-old daughter.The case led to the largest blackmail investigation conducted in the UK, involving at various points more than 100 officers. When Wright was tracked to his family home outside Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, police found photographs of contaminated baby food on his laptop, with the same flavour as the Rochdale jars.Giving evidence, Wright, who used the fictional names of “Guy Brush” and “The Dairy Pirates” in his threats, admitted planting one jar in Lockerbie, but denied tampering with stock in Rochdale.He claimed he had been forced into it by travellers who had threatened to rape his wife and hang his children “from the trees”.But the prosecutor, Julian Christopher QC, told him: “The truth is you were not in fear at all. You were carrying on your life normally while hoping to make yourself rich by threatening Tesco in this way while endangering the life of others in the process.”Mr Justice Warby will pass sentence on 28 September and asked for psychiatric reports on Wright to be prepared, warning him he faced a “lengthy custodial sentence.”Bill Jephson, the assistant chief constable who led the investigation on behalf of Hertfordshire constabulary, described it as the “most serious and most challenging” product contamination case ever dealt with in the UK”. He said there was “very significant” concern over whether there were more contaminated jars, but added he is confident everything that needed to be removed from the shelves was removed.Lucy Thomson, the deputy senior investigating officer, said Wright had “significant knowledge and understanding” of the internet, which he put to negative purposes.“But in terms of his motivation, he’s the only person who will ever truly know why he did what he did and put so many people at risk, including his family, and their livelihood.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ac8c244c5d663fa9308083ce3b97e9980c85e80/13_7_2082_1250/master/2082.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3e82c4ab31de79220e67d3fad9bad6f","title":"uk car dealer sales rise as covid drives people from public transport","story":"Lookers and Vertu report increase in demand in July after lockdowns easedCar dealerships have reported a jump in new and used vehicle sales in July as buyers rushed to secure alternatives to public transport following the easing of the UK’s coronavirus lockdowns.The car industry is hoping that a bounceback in sales thanks to pent-up demand will help it to recover some of the losses suffered during the lockdowns, when showrooms were forced to close. Showrooms in England were allowed to reopen on 1 June but it was not until 29 June that all dealerships across the UK could let in customers.Vertu and Lookers said there was pent-up demand from customers unable to buy during lockdowns, providing some welcome relief for an industry that was already under pressure from the move to online sales before the pandemic.However, the industry is nervously looking ahead to September, the crucial month for new sales when numberplates change. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the UK lobby group, has warned that further job losses could come if sales up to September disappoint.Lookers has already made 1,400 workers redundant, albeit 100 less than initially announced in June.Mark Raban, Lookers’ chief executive, is cautious about the outlook for the industry.“This has been a very challenging period for Lookers but it is encouraging that we are beginning to see some healthy signs of recovery in vehicle sales since the easing of lockdowns,” he said.The company also announced that it had extended the scope of its 2019 audit, forcing it to delay its 2019 results statement after an investigation found potentially fraudulent transactions. In June the group put aside £19m to cover the gap.In a statement to the stock market, Lookers said: “The extended scope of the audit has identified further work on the group’s corporate leasing ision and vehicle financing arrangements and the 2018 and earlier balance sheets to ensure correct identification and allocation of adjustments.

It’s time teachers led the debateThere are two ways of responding to the debacle around exams this summer, which continued this week with the release of GCSE grades and the last-minute delay of BTec results. The first is an urgent, if more narrowly political task: the need to hold accountable those who were responsible for the misjudgments and institutional failures that led us down this worrisome, chaotic path. The second is more imaginative, which is to recognise the unique potential of this moment to transform the national conversation about education.Over the past few months, we have witnessed an unprecedented explosion of public understanding about how the education system actually works, and the unfairnesses it entrenches. Soon after the start of lockdown, many people witnessed the glaringly obvious facts of educational inequality, grasping the role that a person’s home background plays in their school achievement, or the lack of it.Whether it is parents who are too overburdened or under-confident, or a lack of internet access, home computer or quiet study space, it took a virus to expose a galling truth of post-austerity Britain: that children from poorer homesface huge inbuilt disadvantages when it comes to schooling.The recent controversy around the A-level algorithm in England uncovered something more subtle: how using a mathematical model to ensure a broadly similar distribution of exam results year on year required, in effect, to decide ahead of time which schools were to succeed and which to fail. But of course, as the Association of School and College Leaders told me, we had “fixed in aspic” the distribution of grades – and every year, we “consign a proportion of young people to leaving school feeling that they have fallen short”. It’s just not every year that this gets exposed for all to see.Unfortunately, for the government and Ofqual, the computers couldn’t factor in the public impact of furious parents threatening judicial review or the thousands of teenagers refusing to accept the calculations they received. And then – who would ever have guessed it? – teachers, and the quality of their professional judgments, moved to the centre of national debate.There will be some who claim the U-turn over centre-assessed grades (CAGs) was a capitulation to an insufficiently rigorous profession that can’t be trusted with anything as important as school standards. Sadly, this has been the general trend of official thinking since Jim Callaghan’s famous 1976 speech at Ruskin College, Oxford, when the former Labour leader questioned the postwar consensus around the role of teachers in curriculum and assessment. Successive governments have turned the screw on teachers, increasing the pressure while reducing the role of independent judgment and driving out thousands from the profession every year as a result.None of this is a revelation to those who work in education. But fresh public understanding could spur those who are arguing for changes to the ways that schools are assessed, and for reforms of the exam system – particularly GCSEs. As its name suggests, the General Certificate of Secondary Education, first introduced in 1988, has outgrown its original role. A certificate designed to serve as a final record of achievement for those who once left school at 16 now has little or no meaning when all pupils stay on until 18.Calls for reform of GCSEs and A-levels have a long history. In 2004, the former chief inspector of schools, Mike Tomlinson, led a review that proposed an overarching diploma to replace GCSEs, A-levels and vocational qualifications. Failure to heed these proposals was one of the great missed opportunities of the New Labour era that opened the door to coalition reforms. The Conservative idea of educational reform was simply to make all exams much harder, in line with a mythically monolithic private education system based on tough discipline and top marks – and far superior resources, of course.Discontent at Michael Gove’s reforms of our public exam system has been steadily growing. School leaders, teachers and pupils tell regularly of how dull exam material is, how stressful and archaic the formula, how unfit for purpose. A third of pupils, most of them from disadvantaged backgrounds, fail to reach the required standard – that is a level 4 – in the reformed exams for English and maths. They come away not highly educated, but deeply discouraged.Those now supporting the abolition of GCSEs include some unlikely but powerful figures, including Robert Halfon, the Conservative chair of the education select committee, and Kenneth Baker, the architect of the Thatcherite 1988 Education Act. This autumn a coalition of independent and state school heads will propose the replacement of GCSEs by a more sophisticated and flexible set of assessments.But more is needed than a fresh set of proposals. Political discussions about education have been hijacked by a narrow group of interests, using narrow criteria that insist standards are best served by cliff-edge testing and strict rankings. We need a new language to describe and identify the purpose of young people’s school years.Heads and teachers know from experience that flexible and imaginative approaches to learning and assessment drive up standards. It’s teachers, rather than politicians, who must now lead the debate away from raw numbers, statistical models and distrust. Exams should be an element of a far broader suite of intellectual challenges, including coursework, extended projects, oral presentations and hands-on practical work.At the heart of these reforms should be an aim to restore what the writer and teacher Ron Berger calls “work that matters”. If the pandemic and the ensuing exam chaos have resulted in anything positive, it’s that the wider public is finally ready to listen.• Melissa Benn is a founder of the Local Schools Network.

Can the chaos caused by the pandemic also be a moment of change?As concert venues across the UK apply for emergency government aid, artists have been left to find creative ways to keep themselves afloat, turning to ticketed livestreams and supplementary jobs to fill the gap where gigs should be. But behind them all looms an ever-growing debate: what if the whole touring model was broken in the first place?This month, New York musician Hannah Cohen said what many were secretly thinking. “I don’t miss touring,” she wrote on Twitter. “I am relieved. Touring with a band is a bottomless pit of expenses, emotionally \u0026amp physically exhausting and I rarely break even … I will spend this break in touring slowly chipping away at my tour debt.” Other musicians chimed in on the thread, citing non-existent profits and gruelling schedules as a significant strain on their mental health.“It’s possible to make money over a festival season, but with touring, most people I know are really lucky if they break even,” says Alexandra Denton, better known as Shura. After she released her second album, Forevher, in August 2019, her planned promotional campaign around a run of 2020 festivals “evaporated overnight”. With paltry royalties from streaming, touring is now seen as musicians’ primary income. But from the 30 tour dates Shura performed before lockdown, she estimates her overall profit at £2,300 – after takings had been chipped away by the expense of a live band, accommodation and staging, all paid at a fixed rate. “Genuinely, if you can finish a tour and say: ‘We didn’t lose any money’, it’s a real win,” she says. “But for 30 shows, as a single-entity musician, I’m making less than anyone else working on the tour.”A bad situation has been made worse by the pandemic. The UK government announced a £1.75bn fund for culture, but a lack of support for inidual creatives beyond self-employment funds has pushed many artists into sourcing donations directly from fans. Experiments with outdoor, socially distanced gigs are rare, and even though venues can now reopen, few of them are able to because of the difficulty of social distancing. For Fleming, a day job as an online copywriter has provided a safety net while he works on new music, but the increasing commodification of virtual performance leaves him uneasy.“It’s a disgraceful way to ask people to beg for scraps from the table,” he says. “Maybe I’m getting old, but that kind of constant engagement and bespoke interaction feels a bit dissonant with being an artist, with being able to take yourself away and have creative thoughts.”Denton agrees. “We’re going to have to get good at doing other things, but I do think some people will just turn around and say ‘I’m a musician’, and fair enough.” Moreover, the pandemic isn’t conducive to creativity. “I find it difficult to write music when I’m incredibly stressed. The idea of sitting by the piano and writing a song about how I haven’t left the house in five months … not fun.”The unpredictability of the health crisis in different countries also makes it difficult for artists to plan effective touring routes, compounded by possible post-Brexit visa complications. As festival organisers try to recoup 2020’s losses, Denton fears that appearance fees will grow leaner, stripping back the last reliable source of live profit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ad021a8505062695efdeec46e61a6fefd3ccfee/0_133_4442_2667/master/4442.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f96ce48accdd19dc52465ed80d900cc4","title":"english universities to honour admission offers where possible","story":"Government to lift cap on student numbers for some courses and provide extra fundingUniversities in England have pledged to honour as many offers of places to students as possible this year, after an agreement with the government offered extra funding to avert further chaos in admissions.The deal will see the government lift its cap on the number of students taking medicine, dentistry, teaching and veterinary courses in England this year and next year, while promising extra funding for other high-cost subjects.Additional teaching grants will be provided to increase the numbers of people able to take nursing, science, technology, engineering and other high-cost subjects.In return, the universities said they would confirm places for this year or next year to all applicants at their first choice university with the required grades, including those issued by Ofqual based on school assessments.A statement by the Department for Education said all offers would be honoured “where possible, or if maximum capacity is reached to offer an alternative course or a deferred place”.Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, said: “I am delighted the government and the higher education sector have agreed that all students who achieved the required grades will be offered a place at their first choice university.“I want universities to do all they can to take them on this year or offer alternative courses or deferred places where required.”The awarding of A-levels by school assessment has meant many more students have met their offers to study medicine or dentistry. Lifting the cap means they can take up a place this year if available, or be offered a place next year.Prof Richard Harvey, the academic director of admissions at the University of East Anglia, said it had 185 medical places but was facing a possible overshoot of up to 50 students. He said the situation was likely to be replicated at medical schools across the country.The Ucas admissions service said more than three-quarters of 18-year-olds in England have accepted places at either their first or second choices. On Wednesday it said 15,000 students who were originally rejected by their first choice will now meet the A-levels required using their teacher-assessed grades awarded on Thursday.Jo Grady, the University and College Union general secretary, said: “This is a welcome reprieve for many prospective students, but the government’s shambolic decision-making means that every action is taken at the last second and the damaging consequences of those actions are passed straight on to hard-working university staff.”Tim Bradshaw, the chief executive of the Russell Group of universities, said its institutions “will do everything they can” to place students on their preferred courses.“Where this isn’t possible, our universities will look to offer deferred places or explore places on alternative courses where the student meets the entry requirements,” Bradshaw said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3504c1488f4f734f81dc51ab3ecdcb3d6149e34b/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=928978d1f5a730e3e1623342f67019c7","title":"firm linked to gove and cummings hired to work with ofqual on a levels","story":"A company run by long–term associates of Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings has been working behind the scenes with the exams agency Ofqual on its disastrous strategy for determining A-level results, the  can reveal.Public First, a policy and research firm owned by James Frayne and Rachel Wolf, who both formerly worked for Gove, has been involved on the project with Ofqual since June after being granted a contract that was not put out to competitive tender.Details of the contract have not been made public and Ofqual declined to say how much public money had been spent hiring Public First.The firm is understood to have been initially contracted to assist Ofqual with communicating its A-level and GSCE results plan to help secure public confidence in the strategy.A spokesperson for Ofqual said it initially contracted Public First without a tender to work on “insight on public opinion for this year’s exam arrangements”.

They said: “The Cabinet Office had no involvement in the contract and did not discuss it with Ofqual.” Wolf, who co-wrote the Conservative party’s 2019 election manifesto, owns Public First with Frayne, whose work alongside Cummings – the prime minister’s senior adviser – dates back to Eurosceptic campaigning 20 years ago. In 2011 Frayne was appointed the Department for Education’s director of communications when Gove was education secretary and Cummings was his chief political adviser.At that time Wolf was running the New Schools Network (NSN), which promoted Gove’s flagship policy of establishing “free schools,” and was awarded a £500,000 contract by the Department for Education without a tender. That contract was justified on the basis that the NSN was the only organisation able to provide expert support quickly enough.Ofqual, the government agency with responsibility for the integrity of examinations, contracted Public First in early June when the agency’s chair, Roger Taylor, was facing up to the unprecedented task of awarding results with no exams having been taken.It has not been suggested that Public First was involved in developing the algorithm itself. The contract is understood to run until the end of September, when the grades would have long been awarded and university, college and further education places allocated to this year’s new students.Public First does not appear on Ofqual’s public register of invoices above £25,000 issued by outside companies, which was last updated on 29 July but whose most recent entry was dated 19 June – around a week after the contract is understood to have been signed.The Ofqual spokesperson said that usual tendering rules, which typically require open and competitive bids, were bypassed when granting the Public First contract because of “exceptional circumstances”, and that the exams watchdog planned to publish details of the contract at a future date.“Due to the exceptional circumstances presented by the cancellation of exams, the single tender justification process was used for this contract, due to the need to urgently procure the work, in line with our procurement policy.”It is the third batch of work Public First is known to have secured from the government in recent months without having to bid for a public tender. previously revealed how the firm was awarded an £840,000 contract by the Cabinet Office, where Gove is the minister, to research public opinion about the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. That contract, which runs until September, included the secondment of a Public First partner, Gabriel Milland, to work on communications in Downing Street.On Wednesday, the Daily Mirror reported that Public First was given another £116,000 contract by the Department of Health and Social Care to identify ways to “lock in the lessons learned” by the government during the Covid-19 crisis.Public First did not respond to questions from the  about the contract with Ofqual."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea98f8ade9c3c89da3d04ac2c6114f30a4b1a5a/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=731b47e39882eae100c559982003af70","title":"share your reaction and experiences on gcse results day 2020","story":"Whatever your story or what you are planning next, tell us how you feel about this year’s resultsGCSE pupils have joined A-level students in being able to receive their teachers’ recommended grades after an algorithm downgraded up to 2.3m marks and left disadvantaged students worst hit.We want to hear from students, parents and teachers, about how grades have been affected.

Rather than being judged by their exam performance, their grades had been assigned by a computer model that took into account their previous achievements and that of their school.  As Laura McInerney tells Mythili Rao, while at first glance the results last week looked in line with a normal school year, glaring anomalies and what looked to be huge injustices emerged. As pressure built on the government to explain itself, ministers went silent before the education secretary emerged on Monday to announce a major U-turn.  Students who had been downgraded could now use the grades their schools had predicted. But as university places fill up, some are finding it is too little too late.

Each held a five-foot net attached to a long metal pole. The only sounds were the quacks of seabirds and occasionally a new angler plodding into the water and asking, “have you caught anything yet?”Down the beach, someone shouted, “They’re running!” As she and others began dragging their poles through the current they felt the familiar thumping of a sockeye salmon bouncing around in their nets.In Alaska, out-of-staters often pay $200 to $500 for an afternoon of guided fishing. But, if you’ve lived in the state for a full calendar year, you gain a rare privilege, one that is proving all the more essential as the pandemic causes a spike in unemployment and hunger. For a few weeks in July and August, all resident Alaskans are permitted to catch multiple coolers-full of sockeye for free. All they need is a net.Amid a festival atmosphere, Alaskans by their thousands wade with their dip nets into the mouth of the Kenai River, a few hours’ drive from Anchorage, known for its prolific quantity of sockeye, and into its twin, the Kasilof River, just down the road.They’re allowed to take home 25 sockeyes for the head of household, plus 10 more for each additional family member. A family of four, for instance, may collect a total of 55. (The rest of the salmon season, where only rod and reel fishing is allowed, anglers are limited to just six salmon a day.) “The fish are owned by all Alaskans equally,” said Rick Green, special assistant to the commissioner of the Alaska department of fish and game. “It’s a really cool, unique benefit that Alaskan residents get. It’s a way to use the resource owned by the people for the benefit of the people.”While Alaska has a long history of subsistence living, this year, the pandemic’s impacts on the state’s large tourism and oil industries mean it feels more important than ever to stockpile the single largest shared natural resource in the state.It’s too early to say how many salmon were harvested this season, though with more than 26,000 Alaskans households applying for dip-netting permits this year, it is probably around a half million.“It’s hugely important for Alaskans,” said Green. “You’re talking $8 or more per pound of protein, and all these people are getting that just by sticking a net in the water. The freezer of meat they’ll have is worth thousands of dollars.”Buying the same amount of salmon in a store would be prohibitively expensive for many of those taking to the Kenai.If an angler is lucky, they might be able to catch several dozen fish in a single day. One fisherman, Jeff Todisco, caught 21 salmon on his first day dip-netting on the Kenai. “It’s insurance for the winter, making sure we can provide for our families,” said Todisco, who works in the airline industry and has a young daughter.The practice is often referred to as “going to fish camp” because many people go for multiple days, spending the time between tides camping on the rocky beach.No matter the year, the encampment is vast and eclectic, not unlike a music festival. On the dunes, just out of reach of high tide, colorful tents are pitched, lawn chairs surround fire pits, there are stacks of gear and coolers, and wet waders hang to dry. Because of the coronavirus, the city of Kenai has erected hand-washing and sanitizing stations.It is strikingly egalitarian, because the only barrier to entry is obtaining a free license, which is easy enough, and owning or borrowing a dip net. Strolling among the tents, you can hear English, Russian, Arabic, Tagalog, Serbian, Samoan, Mandarin and myriad other languages being spoken. (This makes sense considering Anchorage, the state’s most populous city, is often ranked as one of the most erse school districts in the nation)The salmon swim upriver to spawn. While people prophesy about when it’s best to fish (on the incoming tide, just after high tide, during the slack tide), various factors determine when the fish come in the thickest, ranging from how far along the season is to how many commercial fishing boats are out. Often, it’s just luck.One bluebird morning at the end of July, the fish started churning upriver in large numbers and the excitement was palpable. Children too small to hold a long net stood sentry on the shoreline, grasping small wooden mallets. When the salmon were ferried to shore, they ran up and offered to stun the animal with a quick blow to forehead. Several times, they join an excited hooting when fishers found multiple fish in their nets at once – the true sign of a bountiful tide.Some were plunked into a cooler to be tended to after the run. Bigger groups set to work cleaning and filleting the fish immediately, running a knife along the belly from tail to head, pulling out the innards, and then pressing the blade along the bones to free the ruby red flesh. Overachievers went as far as smoking or vacuum-sealing theirs on the beach.“Having salmon definitely makes a big difference for my family,” said Isaac Iaea, who has participated for the last eight years. He has six children and often sends smoked salmon to his parents in Hawaii. His eight-person household is allowed 95 fish.“I’m very grateful for this,” Iaea said of his bounty. “It’s amazing that we’re able to do this. It means a lot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7960ec1cc3bb29c72cf4b593b58cdadb45fd07b7/0_780_4282_2569/master/4282.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e99221721def6e1ed80963546fe31c92","title":"greenland ice sheet lost a record 1m tonnes of ice per minute in 2019","story":"Climate-driven loss is likely to be the worst for centuries, and is pushing up sea levels The Greenland ice sheet lost a record amount of ice in 2019, equivalent to a million tonnes per minute across the year, satellite data shows.The climate crisis is heating the Arctic at double the rate in lower latitudes, and the ice cap is the biggest single contributor to sea level rise, which already imperils coasts around the world. The ice sheet shrank by 532bn tonnes last year as its surface melted and glaciers fell into the ocean and would have filled seven Olympic-sized swimming pools per second.The satellite data has been collected since 2003. The 2019 loss was double the annual average since then of 255bn tonnes. Almost that amount was lost in July 2019 alone.Scientists knew that ice loss from Greenland had been accelerating fast in recent decades and that there had been high rates of melting in 2019. But the satellite data accounts for new snowfall and allows the net loss to be calculated. The researchers said the scale of the 2019 loss was shocking and was likely to be the biggest in centuries or even millennia.If the entire Greenland ice sheet melts, sea level would rise by six metres. But the researchers said it was not certain that the sheet had passed the point of no return and that cutting carbon emissions will slow the melting, which would take centuries to complete.Snowfall in Greenland was low in 2019, also due to the blocking pattern, meaning relatively little new ice was added. “The real message is that the ice sheet is strongly out of balance,” Sasgen said.Weather data and computer models allow for losses to be calculated back to 1948. “If we look at the record melt years, the top five occurred in the last 10 years, and that is a concern. But we know what to do about it: reduce CO2 emissions.”Sasgen said a further worry was feedback mechanisms that increase ice loss, including meltwater weakening the ice sheet and speeding its fall into the ocean. Hotter weather also melts the white snow on top of the sheet, revealing darker ice below, which absorbs more of the sun’s heat.The research, published in the journal Communications Earth \u0026amp Environment, used data from the Nasa’s Grace satellites, which take gravity measurements and in effect weigh the mass of ice in Greenland.The first Grace satellite ended its data collection in June 2017, and its replacement began in May 2018. Data from the second satellite was used to determine how much had been lost in the intervening period.The researchers found 2017 and 2018 had unusually low ice loss, owing to a reversal of the blocking pattern that resulted in cold, snowy conditions fixed over Greenland. But even in these conditions the sheet still lost ice, meaning cold years do not compensate for the hot ones as in the past.“It really shows that we have entered a completely different state,” with a trend of increasing ice losses and more variability each year, Sasgen said. “Greenland has become bipolar in a way.”Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, of the University of Potsdam in Germany, said the new analysis was convincing and showed the transition from the old to the new satellite had worked smoothly.“Since meltwater is freshwater, it dilutes the salt content of the surrounding ocean, which contributes to slowing the Gulf stream system,” Rahmstorf said. “If we wanted to make the 500bn tonnes of freshwater added in 2019 as salty as ocean water, about 200,000 Panamax-class cargo ships full of salt would need to dump their load into the Atlantic.”Despite the rapid melting, the Greenland ice sheet is not necessarily doomed to melt entirely. Firstly, as glaciers retreat they lose contact with warmer ocean waters and therefore melt less. Secondly, the melting of the sheet with warm air takes centuries, during which time the rise in global temperatures might be reversed.“If we reduce CO2, we will reduce Arctic warming and we will therefore also reduce the sea level rise contribution from the Greenland ice sheet,” Sasgen said. “So even though it might eventually disappear in large part, it happens much slower, which would be better as it would allow more time for the 600 million people living near coasts to move away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfd07c538d20a2ae732de51ed00f17f951c21784/0_197_1106_663/master/1106.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a9bc80a8289d1598e7325740382d5ee5","title":"ladj ly shocking president macron paris riot film les miserables la haine","story":"The French leader was so appalled by Les Misérables, a film about a riot in a tough banlieue, that he launched an investigation. The director of ‘the new La Haine’ talks about the country’s angry underclass When Ladj Ly was a teenager, his mate stole a lion cub from the circus. The pair kept it in an apartment, but it cried for its mother, upset the neighbours – and the people who ran the circus demanded it be returned.Fast forward two decades and Ly uses that real-life catnapping as narrative spur for his award-winning debut film Les Misérables. The setting is Montfermeil, a tough banlieue north-east of Paris where he was born and raised. Montfermeil is also the location of the Thénardiers’ inn in Victor Hugo’s 1862 novel Les Misérables, the place where former convict Jean Valjean meets the orphan Cosette.Ly is highlighting the continuities between 19th-century fiction and 21st-century reality: the misérables of present-day France are his neighbours, overwhelmingly families of African or Arabic heritage, suffering poverty, police racism, democratic deficit and official neglect. “The cub is clearly a metaphor for being deprived of freedom, of being unnaturally trapped,” he says. “The misery of Montfermeil has never been really addressed. We’re still trapped, still misunderstood, still underfunded.”And yet his film starts not with misery but with joy. France is celebrating World Cup victory over Croatia in 2018 and two friends, Buzz and Issa, head from their concrete jungle to the Champs Elysées to join the party. For Lys, the celebrations echoed those he witnessed aged 18 in 1998 when a team of different colours, creeds and cultures also won the World Cup and showed the world that France was multicultural. “I’m a little older than the characters of the film, and 12 July 1998 marked me for life. I remember it to this day”But surely, I gently suggest to Ly, the bonds created by football are delusive. That much was argued by a Parisian academic Marc Perelman in a brilliant book called Barbaric Sport: A Global Plague. Such triumphs, Perelman wrote, “created an illusion of fraternity, celebration and joy of being together while in this enchanted and magic world”.“I think that’s right,” says Ly. “Football is the new opium of the masses. “But for a moment it was magic.” In the film, he depicts what happens when the magic stops.They return to Montfermeil no longer at one with the loved-up French nation, but back in a deprived, class-bound, ethnically profiled, impoverished banlieue, for all that 30 different nationalities have learned to live together there. In one scene, some girls waiting for a bus are hassled and sexually harassed by a racist cop. One girl starts to film the harassment on her phone, but the cop snatches it and smashes it on the ground. “That sort of thing happened to me a thousand times,” says Ly. “I was 10 when I was first stopped and searched by a policeman.”Ly started filming at any early age. “I bought my first camera aged 17 and made my first feature-length documentary during the 2005 riots. The riots erupted at the bottom of my building, and ultimately I had 100 hours of rushes.” At the time, the rioters were condemned by interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy as “racaille” or scum, a slur that still outrages Ly. “He caused the riots by underfunding us and using such words to get the far-right racists to support his election campaign rather than the National Front.” Just possibly it worked: Sarkozy was elected French president two years later.Supported by his collective Kourtrajmé (which is French slang or verlan for court métrage or short film), Ly edited footage he shot during and after the riots and then uploaded a web documentary called 365 days in Clich-Montfermeil. “I wanted the insider’s perspective on what happened during the riots rather than the one the media portrayed, so I put it online. This was before YouTube, so it was quite revolutionary.”Ly went on to direct another feature-length documentary set in the African homeland of his parents, 365 Days in Mali. He made it to contradict the media image of the country as the most dangerous place on Earth because of Al Qaida and Islamic State. Once more, he couldn’t get traditional broadcasters to screen the film so he put it online.Ly wasn’t done with filming the streets where he lives. He decided to fictionally recast some of the incidents of his childhood to create a drama about Montfermeil, made by and starring people he knows. The result was Les Misérables. Among those stars is his own son, Al-Hassan Ly. He plays the nerdy film obsessive Buzz who incessantly films his estate, just as Ladj Ly did back in the day. Buzz’s eye is hardly innocent: he uses a drone camera to spy on girls getting undressed in their flats until they find out what he’s up to and threaten to beat him up if doesn’t delete the footage.But it’s the stolen cub that precipitates the riot Ly depicts in Les Misérables. In order to defuse a looming war between tooled-up circus folk and local toughs, the cops seek out the boy who nicked the cub. But when they find Issa their arrest goes horribly wrong, provoking Montfermeil’s youth to rise up and propelling Ly’s film into a final 30 minutes of deranged violence.I tell Ly his film reminds me of Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing, particularly the scene in which Lee’s character chucks a dustbin through a pizzeria thus catalysing a riot. “I know what you mean, but I’m not very much influenced by other people’s films. I try not to watch them so I don’t copy them.” That said, he accepts the parallel between Les Misérables and the last great French movie set among the oppressed of Parisian banlieues, Mathieu Kassovitz’s La Haine, which is being rereleased in the UK this autumn 25 years after it was made. “What’s sad is that my film needed to be made. Things have clearly not changed in France between La Haine 25 years ago and Les Misérables now.”Well, there are differences between the films, not least the treatment of the police. “I haven’t shown all the cops as racists,” says Ly. “And I’m certainly not showing the boys who riot as innocent victims. Reality is more mixed up. There are some rotten eggs in the police, but not all. The problem is that many cops come to Montfermeil after training and they have no idea what they’ve got into. They’re terrified. But they are living tough lives, too.”In the film, Ly dramatises this through the character of newly arrived white cop called Stéphane, an outsider from Cherbourg who asked for a transfer to Paris to improve his chances of gaining custody of his son from his ex-wife. For all his gaucheness around people of colour, he is disgusted with how his colleagues police the neighbourhood and behaves with compassion to the local youth, unlike his crew boss, the cynical racist Chris, or Chris’s compromised partner, Gwada, both of whom have become desensitised to the brutal way they police their patch.This nuanced view of policing is all the more surprising since Ly himself has had trouble with the law. The French daily Libération reported last December that the director served a two-year prison term for complicity in a kidnapping case. When I ask Ly about this, though, he confines himself to telling me he sued two rightwing magazines, Valeurs actuelles and Causeur, for racist slander in falsely reporting he had been convicted of taking part in an attempted murder. “They were making up these stories about me because they didn’t want my voice to be heard. They wanted to undermine the impact of the film.”If so, they failed. Les Misérables has not only been feted in France, winning the César for best film and the jury prize at Cannes, but shortlisted for this year’s Oscars. He tells me some of the profits for the film have been used to bankroll a film school for local kids, giving them the skills that Ly acquired autodidactically. “French film schools are really just for the elites.” Maybe that’s why French cinema has become so boring. “Exactly!” he laughs.At the end of the film, a quote from Hugo’s novel pops up on screen. “Remember this, my friends: there are no such things as bad plants or bad men. There are only bad cultivators.” The suggestion is that the French state has for centuries poorly cultivated its most deprived citizens now those citizens have to cultivate their own. Indeed, the only space offering respite that is depicted in the film is a kebab shop run by a serene ex-jihadist, and the only moral force on the streets is a group of Muslim men who strive to get the youth to forgo crime. I ask Ly if he is a Muslim, proselytising for his faith in the film? He declines to say: “That’s private.”Ly is particularly interested in how Les Misérables will be received in francophone African countries. “I hope that the film will discourage Africans from emigrating to France, but instead stay home and develop their own countries.”Ly’s own parents were part of the post-second world war generation of Malians invited to France to do jobs the French disdained, contemporaries of the Windrush generation invited to Britain. “The contribution of immigrants to France is largely ignored, even though they fought for France in world war one, world war two and helped France recover after the war. Still the descendants of those immigrants are treated badly, as though they are not French.”At least President Macron, having reportedly been shocked by the France depicted in Les Misérables, has ordered an investigation into poverty in the banlieues. Ly welcomes this, but adds: “How could he not have known the extent of the problems I show in the film? It’s not like it’s news. It’s been like this for ever.”A few months after interviewing Ly in the spring, I catch up with him again in a world changed utterly by coronavirus and the resurgent Black Lives Matter movement, prompted by the death of George Floyd. Ly tells me he’s been in lockdown with his family in Montfermeil, writing films and watching his beloved neighbourhood struggle. “Covid has highlighted all the existing inequalities and accentuated them. This allowed us to show the failures of our system in an unprecedented crisis.“The situation was quite complicated since many families were already living in precarious conditions, but the confinement caused many residents to lose their jobs, which further increased the instability of their situation. Many could no longer provide for themselves and their children. A food bank has been set up in Montfermeil to help them.”As for Black Lives Matter, its rise this year has, for Ly, shown that the problems of institutional racism and police brutality are not only American. “It’s nothing new, but the death of George Floyd has given it a face and visibility unmatched before, which of course is abnormal and deplorable. We must no longer wait for men and women to die before they are heard.”Floyd’s killing resonated strongly for Ly since its circumstances uncannily paralleled the death of a Malian-French man, Adama Traoré, who in 2016 died on his 24th birthday in Beaumont-sur-Oise, north of Paris, while in police custody. Traoré’s family, backed by independent medical reports, insist that he died under of the weight of three police officers as they tried to restrain him. Lawyers for the officers deny the police were at fault.“Today,” says Ly, “the BLM movement allows other fights like that of the Traoré family in France to finally be heard. Although the protests were not as numerous as in the US, marches and a rally were able to take place in Paris, which had never been the case before.”The leading problem with your film, I tell Ly, is its dearth of women. We only see a few in back rooms or kitchens none is a significant protagonist. “Maybe you will see more in my next films,” he says. “I haven’t decided yet.” He is planning more films: Les Misérables is the first in a projected trilogy. The second will go back 10 years to the struggles of the mayor. “And then I will go back even further into the history of Montfermeil. I’m not done with it.”But if Montfermeil is as miserable as you suggest, why carry on living and working there? “Because it’s my home! That’s where I belong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/043be551ef049df0f0c06d07acba3ad47ef28874/1078_221_1986_1192/master/1986.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ac7aa24580d3de983d6174356d0901","title":"the top 10 long awaited films ranked","story":"Following substantial delays, anticipation is sky-high for Tenet and the new Bond, No Time to Die.

From there, two versions were released (The Princess and the Cobbler, followed in 1995 by Arabian Knight), neither of them complete or sanctioned by Williams, who died in 2019. Various fan edits (known as The Recobbled Cuts) have brought the film closer to his original vision.Sixteen years elapsed between work starting on the screenplay of this Bollywood historical epic about Akbar the Great, emperor of India in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and the film’s release. The production itself lasted 12 years, on and off. When shooting was almost complete, the director, K Asif, wanted to junk the black-and-white footage and start all over again in the newly available Technicolor format. His producers were unenthusiastic some colour scenes were added instead.Barbara Hershey gave Martin Scorsese a copy of Nikos Kazantzakis’s novel about Christ’s human, fallible side when they worked together on the director’s second feature, Boxcar Bertha, released in 1972. A version he planned to shoot in 1983, with Aidan Quinn in the lead, was thwarted partly by a campaign by Christian fundamentalist groups. When it was released five years later with Willem Dafoe replacing Quinn, and Hershey as Mary Magdalene, its opponents rained fire and brimstone down on the project. Franco Zeffirelli called the film “truly horrible and completely deranged”, his opprobrium undiminished by the fact that he hadn’t seen it.Richard Linklater set aside a month each year from 2001 to 2013 to shoot Boyhood piecemeal in between his other films, allowing the cast, including Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke and newcomer Ellar Coltrane (who was six when shooting began), to age magically before our eyes thanks to that most special of effects: time. The director is now a year into an even more ambitious project: an adaptation of Stephen Sondheim’s counter-chronological musical Merrily We Roll Along, starring Beanie Feldstein, Ben Platt and Blake Jenner, which will be in cinemas – if they still exist – circa 2039.Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo were in their teens when they started work on their groundbreaking pseudo-documentary, a chilling “what if?” that imagined Britain in the aftermath of its defeat in the second world war. During seven years of on-again, off-again production, they received moral and financial support from the director Tony Richardson, while Stanley Kubrick was so fascinated by the endeavour that he donated “short ends” from Dr Strangelove – rolls of film not completely exposed – for the pair to use.It took five years for David Lynch to complete his unnerving and morbidly funny industrial-horror debut. Filming ground to a halt whenever the production ran out of money family and friends (including Lynch’s art designer Jack Fisk and Fisk’s wife, the actor Sissy Spacek) chipped in to supplement the meagre income the director was earning from a paper round delivering the Wall Street Journal Lynch also separated from his wife during the shoot, and slept in the disused stables where some of the film was made.Stanley Kubrick had the idea of adapting Arthur Schnitzler’s novel Traumnovelle in the late 1970s, when he considered casting Steve Martin in the role that would eventually go to Tom Cruise. By the time Eyes Wide Shut was released in 1999, 12 years after his previous film, Full Metal Jacket, it had shed several cast members during a shoot that lasted more than 15 months (Jennifer Jason Leigh and Harvey Keitel, unavailable for reshoots, were replaced by Marie Richardson and Sydney Pollack respectively) and Kubrick himself had died. It was fitting that audiences should endure a lengthy wait for a film that has delayed gratification baked into its bones, with Cruise’s character repeatedly on the verge of having sex but never quite getting down to it.This full-bodied Bollywood musical is uxoriousness in celluloid form. It was 1955 when the poet and director Kamal Amrohi conceived of a story in which his wife, Meena Kumari, would play the dual roles of a prostitute who dies in childbirth and the daughter who grows up to struggle, like her late mother, to escape her ignoble background. Shooting began in black-and-white in 1958 only to start all over again in colour and finally CinemaScope before hitting the ultimate speed bump: the couple’s separation in 1964. Five years later, Amrohi persuaded Kumari, who was by then suffering from liver cirrhosis, to complete the film in exchange for a orce. She attended the premiere in February 1972 and died the following month.You wait a decade or two for an awol director to return to the fray and then three turn up at once: Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas and Terrence Malick all reappeared at the end of the 1990s. Lucas took the longest (it had been 22 years since he directed the first Star Wars film) but loses points by dint of returning with The Phantom Menace. Malick at least had the decency to come back with this masterpiece. These days he pops out movies like Tic Tacs, but audiences had to wait two decades between Days of Heaven in 1978 and The Thin Red Line, his meditative follow-up about the battle of Guadalcanal in the second world war. It reduced stars such as John Travolta and George Clooney to walk-ons, left Mickey Rourke and Bill Pullman missing in action on the cutting-room floor and demoted Adrien Brody from leading man to near-wordless onlooker. All grist to the mill: the result was profound enough to be well worth the 20-year wait."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e08ff138542083fd5bc4b7acc365c3b79d8a55f7/0_1389_4912_2946/master/4912.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c7041600a1729344862e58fe149820a6","title":"chelsea move closer to signing kai havertz from bayer leverkusen","story":"Chelsea are closing in on the signing of Kai Havertz after holding further talks with Bayer Leverkusen over a fee for the Germany winger.Havertz is intent on joining the Stamford Bridge club this summer and belief is growing that Chelsea will be able to reach an agreement with Leverkusen. It is understood negotiations between the two clubs are moving at an encouraging pace.Chelsea’s initial offer of €65m (£58.6m) plus €15m in add-ons earlier this week was not enough to satisfy Leverkusen, who are holding out for as much as €100m. However, it is understood that the Stamford Bridge club, who are hoping to sweeten the deal with lucrative add-ons and bonuses, moved closer to the Bundesliga side’s valuation during a productive meeting on Wednesday.Havertz is one of the best young talents in Europe and signing the 21-year-old would represent a coup for Chelsea, who have already strengthened their attack with the signings of Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech. Bayern Munich and Real Madrid have courted the Germany international but are unable to afford him this summer. Havertz, who has two years left on his current deal, is keen for a fresh challenge following Leverkusen’s failure to qualify for the Champions League.Alongside champions Liverpool, Chelsea are also monitoring developments with the Brighton defender Ben White. Leeds United have already had two bids for White rejected and although they have made a third offer of £25m, Brighton are determined not to sell the 22-year-old.Lampard admires White, who helped Leeds win promotion to the Premier League during an impressive spell on loan at Elland Road last season, but it remains to be seen if anyone can come up with enough money to alter Brighton’s stance this summer. White, who has two years left on his contract with the option of an extra year, is yet to agree a new deal with Brighton and has rejected the club’s latest offer.Chelsea are hunting for defensive reinforcements, with Lampard keen to strengthen at left-back by signing Leicester’s Ben Chilwell. However Chelsea, who want West Ham’s Declan Rice, are likely to need to raise funds through sales before bringing in new defenders.Emerson Palmieri, out of favour at left-back, is a target for Internazionale and Lampard has been told that he will need to sell one of his four centre-backs before buying one. Fikayo Tomori was the subject of a loan bid from Rennes earlier this month but no decision has been made on the 22-year-olds’ short-term future.Chelsea could also boost their budget by allowing Jorginho to return to Serie A. Roma are interested in the Italy midfielder, who joined Chelsea from Napoli two years ago, however it is unlikely they will be able to meet Chelsea’s asking price for him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc2605eb73774cdd061a59454f85f16648123ec6/442_622_2752_1652/master/2752.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=91e458f36e70695e32c3b2894102e679","title":"the worst thing i did was set up my office in my living room how four company bosses are optimising remote working","story":"When British businesses relocated from the office to the home, new working routines were hastily established, then gradually refined. How did bosses ensure they got the best from their staff and themselves?On 23 March, when prime minister Boris Johnson responded to the threat of Covid-19 by imposing lockdown measures and restricting travel to essential journeys, British businesses braced themselves for the unknown. Office buildings emptied as UK households struggled to adapt to new demands. Two-bedroom flats became offices for as many as four adults, while family homes had to accommodate not only the work needs of adults, but a soundproofed environment for children – how else to manage all those Zoom calls?“The biggest challenge for me has been having my children at home this whole time,” says Matt Caroll, founding partner and executive creative director at Mr. White, a premium production partner for brands, creating video content and other marketing assets. “The past five months I’ve been filled with guilt – either for not spending enough time with the kids, or for not working enough.”For Gillies, managing his staff during this period has been as much about checking on their personal wellbeing as monitoring that tasks are getting done. “It certainly pays to be a little more vigilant than usual, but that’s mostly to check people are doing OK in general and have what they need to work efficiently,” he says. “Everyone is different and some need a little more encouragement to remain enthusiastic.”Roger Hollies, chief technology officer at Arenko Group, which develops software and hardware to control large-scale battery systems to support the UK’s electricity grid, agrees that supporting iniduals takes many forms. “Some people thrive off clear and precise instructions on how to solve a problem others you just give the problem to then get the hell out of the way!” he says. “I think the pandemic situation has amplified the need for managers to be sensitive to how to manage different personalities.”Hollies points out that Arenko has always had a flexible approach to working, but that people flocked to its central London office in Chancery Lane regardless. “It was great fun, really vibrant and energetic. People miss it,” he says.The company has done its best to recreate that atmosphere, despite the obvious limitations. “Our people team has encouraged online social activities, such as weekly quizzes and spot ‘fun fact’ sessions at lunchtimes,” says Hollies. “We also had weekly yoga sessions and one of the team even ran bi-weekly high-intensity interval training sessions.”Caroll has a similar fondness for the office and its surroundings. “We’re in Shoreditch – like every other production outfit – and it’s a great part of London to be in,” he says. “But we want the team to feel reassured they’re not being herded back to their desks. So much has changed since March and it’s going to take a while for us all to build our confidence back up.”Video conferencing has played a huge part in making remote working possible for so many, and there’s perhaps no starker prediction for what our working futures will look like than the predicted growth of Zoom, which now expects $1.8bn of revenue within its first full fiscal year of operation. But can it ever truly replace the casual ease of face-to-face conversations?“Simple meetings can be a bit more hassle than usual – certainly more long-winded,” says Caroll. “You end up catching up on what you did last night before you actually get into the reason for the call. In the office, that sort of chat normally just happens throughout the day, so when you sit down for a meeting, it’s more streamlined. We use a WhatsApp group for questions, quick favours and to keep everyone updated.”Pond Group has experienced similar limitations. “If we’re having a phone or video conference, people can’t take customer phone calls,” says Gillies, “so we’ve had to adapt to using things like group messaging instead, but it’s no substitute for face-to-face discussion.”While some companies have used remote working as an opportunity to experiment with their wardrobes, Jon Lloyd, head of production at Infopro Digital, a business-to-business publisher, conference and events company employing approximately 300 people, likes to keep things as true to office life as possible. “I still wear my work stuff during the week. I feel that’s important. And I go out in the morning and at lunch for half-hour or 45-minute walks – about the same amount of exercise as I had with my commute and at lunchtime at work.”Hollies, who used to cycle to the office, has had to find alternatives to bookend the day. “Yoga, meditation or a fitness class – or something as simple as a walk – to mark the transition from home to work and back again can help with managing the work-life boundaries critical to maintaining good mental wellbeing,” he says.He points out that he made mistakes in this area early in lockdown: “The worst thing I did was set up my office in my living room. We were in the middle of some home improvements when lockdown kicked in, so I had little choice, but it made switching off from work extremely difficult.”However restrictions may be lifted or reimplemented over the coming months, there’s a reluctance to revert to office life as we knew it, tempered by a broad enthusiasm for the future. “My new daily routine is mostly preparing project plans for migrating customers to cloud-based systems and identifying areas where they can save costs – often centred around how easy it would be to close a London HQ and replace it with regional offices and home workers,” says Gillies.“If people don’t have long, busy commutes, they are more likely to walk or use a bike, and have more time to spend with friends and family. Healthy staff equals healthy businesses.

But the effort paid off as its new website thrived. Now a team of online experts are showing its owner how to reach a wider audienceSteven Winter doesn’t think of himself as an entrepreneur. But with four cafes, market stalls, a wholesale business, and now a successful e-commerce website, the founder of Bread Source has built himself something of a retail empire in Norfolk. “I’ve only ever been a baker,” he says. “That’s all I’ve done since I was 15 years old.”“Bread is a hard thing to produce, it’s a hard thing to sell,” he adds. “It’s a challenge on a daily, hourly, minute basis. It’s a 247 living, breathing thing that fills all of your time. For the past year or so we’ve been building the business – we moved into a larger unit and opened a new shop six months before the pandemic hit.”Getting online as the Covid-19 lockdown took hold was a priority as local restaurants and cafes started cancelling orders and the markets closed. Winter says he was driven by his responsibility to help keep the community fed, particularly as supermarkets were struggling at the time. But where to start? It’s a dilemma many microbusinesses (under nine employees) faced. According to website builder and domain expert GoDaddy, a fifth of microbusinesses reacted by setting up an online presence for the first time while nearly half improved their use of digital and social media tools.According to Irana Wasti, regional president for EMEA at GoDaddy: “The outbreak is accelerating change that GoDaddy has seen with microbusinesses for a long time, with a move to online and e-commerce products and services. For microbusinesses, it has meant nothing short of the second digital revolution.”To that end, GoDaddy has been helping small businesses get online with its suite of accessible digital tools, and its advice platform OpenWeStand. This offers GoDaddy tips on topics including promoting a business locally, choosing the right e-commerce platforms, and growing audiences on social media – its launch video alone has been viewed 60 million times.That’s why Bread Source has teamed up with GoDaddy and is being given additional mentoring by Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of the healthy snacks business Graze, to grow and nurture its online customers. The company also wants to explore new distribution channels and scale what has been an encouraging first foray into e-commerce.Before the pandemic, Bread Source’s website was a simple holding page, recalls Rosie Mills-Smith, Bread Source’s marketing lead. Launching a fully functioning online shop within a few days and delivering orders using the bakery’s two vans was no mean feat, but the move was incredibly well received. The number of online orders hit 200 a day during April. Some of that demand has tapered off since lockdown has eased, but the team plans to make the e-shop a permanent fixture. “It continues to bubble away,” Mills-Smith says about the online orders. “We took £95,000 in April – that was exceptional, and for a bakery that’s a lot of product – it included 15,000 cinnamon buns and 9,000 cardamom buns.”In their first mentoring session, Winter, Mills-Smith and Fletcher discussed the appeal of subscription models, how to use email marketing effectively, and the importance of sharing Bread Source’s story more widely.“You’ve been paddling like crazy,” Fletcher remarks. “The one thing I’m pretty confident of is people’s views about what they want from business has changed. They want to know more about the motivations of the business, the people behind it, they’d rather shop local.”According to Winter, Mills-Smith has helped enormously with highlighting Bread Source’s story since she joined the business two years ago. As a baker, he’s more used to staying behind the scenes, letting his products speak for themselves. The difficult thing, Mills-Smith says, is telling the story in a way that feels authentic and interesting, both to new and established customers. “It’s one thing to do a social media post, saying: ‘This is going on at the bakery today’, or ‘this is part of the process that brings you your product’, but how many times can you beat that drum?” she asks.Bread Source has built up a database of 5,000 customers over lockdown. For its first marketing email sent using GoDaddy’s newsletter tool, Winter and Mills-Smith decided to offer a discount on any orders over £5. They were impressed with the results, seeing an extra 360 orders over five days. They felt that the GoDaddy tool was straightforward and intuitive to use. “This has proven that people want to hear from us,” Mills-Smith says. “There were only 12 unsubscribes. But we’re not going to do this weekly. We’re not going to say anything unless it’s worth saying.”Extending the distance that products travel also poses a challenge in terms of freshness and quality, Winter says. Fletcher points to brands such as Freddie’s Flowers and Bloom \u0026amp Wild, which have done this with flowers, and questions whether there’s a model that would work for bread.Winter agrees it’s an interesting proposition if done with longer-life products. “That’s potentially the holy grail for a bakery like us.” He does wonder, though, whether the subscription model is on the decline after peaking some years ago.Adding the e-commerce element has helped reassure Winter that the business (and team) is adaptable and can survive, no matter what happens. “As a small business, that’s completely our bonus. We can react and do new products in a heartbeat, which is cool,” he says. “We have these elements of the business that if something does happen in the future, we’re OK again.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at openwestand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed. More than 50 companies have joined the cause, including Slack, Salesforce, PayPal, and more"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c19df54bd92f2808b4fb217d0397eb8c102ee182/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d6193dede0815dbba9305d9a7529a249","title":"dr martens for life pledge has left me worn out","story":"I spent £145 on a pair because they agreed to repair or replace them – but I can’t claimIn 2016 I purchased a pair of Dr Martens shoes under its “for life” scheme, whereby it agreed to repair or replace worn-out DM shoes.

At the height of the migration crisis in 2015, more than a million people arrived on the continent’s southern shores.“The assessment is that this is very much picking and choosing aspects of the current EU system,” a European diplomat said. An EU official said: “The proposal, from the EU perspective, isn’t very operational and doesn’t bring a lot of added value.”European diplomats stress that the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has no power to negotiate a readmission agreement on migrants with the UK. The Frenchman’s negotiating mandate, laid down by 27 governments, makes vague proposals for cooperation and “regular dialogues” on managing the thousands of people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.The UK immigration minister, Chris Philp, said after talks with French officials this month that Britain and France were working “at pace” on a new plan to deter people from crossing the Channel in small boats, but he provided few details.The French interior ministry did not respond to questions on French objectives for any bilateral plans with the UK, or EU-wide policy.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Dublin III regulation is inflexible, rigid and is abused by both migrants and activist lawyers to frustrate the returns of those who have no right to be here. Whilst we are bound by Dublin for the duration of the transition period, the UK will be able to negotiate its own bilateral returns arrangements from the end of this year.”Home Office figures show the UK returns few asylum seekers to other EU countries. In 2018 it transferred 209 people under the Dublin regulation, while accepting 1,215 migrants from the rest of Europe.While Johnson has complained about the difficulty of returning asylum seekers to the EU, European nations are unsympathetic to a country on the north-western fringes that receives relatively few asylum applications.In 2019, Germany registered 142,450 applications for asylum, France 119,915 and Greece 74,905, according to the European Asylum Support Office. The UK recorded 44,250 asylum requests."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f57005038b40660070c982fe611b1bfb703add0f/0_0_2790_1674/master/2790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b170eabd70cfa4597644598b1dfd10d","title":"liz truss meetings with hard brexit group deleted from public register","story":"Trade secretary held talks with Institute for Economic Affairs that were on transparency register until being reclassified as personal Recent meetings between Liz Truss, the UK trade secretary, and a pro-hard Brexit thinktank have been reclassified as personal discussions, removing them from the public record and sparking Labour allegations that she wants to conceal the group’s influence on public policy.Two meetings with Truss and the Institute of Economic Affairs had originally been included in quarterly transparency data published on the government’s website and described as discussing trade. They were removed on Wednesday with a note explaining they were personal meetings – the first such revision since the department was created in 2016.The IEA is an influential right-leaning thinktank that promotes free markets and has argued strongly for a hard break from the European Union since the 2016 Brexit referendum.Labour said Truss appeared to be evading rules designed to ensure integrity, transparency and honesty in public office. Government rules require meetings with external organisations that discuss official business to be declared.“It makes no sense for Liz Truss now to claim that meetings on those issues had nothing to do with her ministerial role, and suggests instead that she has something to hide, whether in terms of who attended the meetings or what specifically was discussed,” said a spokesman for Emily Thornberry, Labour’s shadow trade secretary.The Department for International Trade said the meetings were initially included due to an administrative error and they held no information about them. It declined to comment when asked how a meeting on trade and investment could be considered a personal meeting.The IEA said it regularly hosted events and meetings with ministers and others but did not provide any further details of the meetings with Truss. “By definition the private events we run do not involve the minuting or publication of the full, frank and free exchange of views which we try to ensure takes place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c5558fde1127d5776f19b7bea2455b782cfb0ba/0_248_5220_3132/master/5220.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fdc0bf211148e4e09c3791e7e02a941","title":"be flexible be positive how to kickstart productivity at work after lockdown","story":"There’s never been an opportunity like it – businesses that seize the moment can build a future that works for them and their staffThe coronavirus pandemic has thrown iniduals and businesses alike into the unknown.For companies, there was the challenge of staying afloat in a world that had come to a halt for people, it was about juggling the competing priorities of work, family and home. Now everyone faces a new issue: how to return to some semblance of business normality.“The world of work – particularly how we think about work and how we think about where we work, has fundamentally shifted,” says coach and productivity expert Karen Eyre-White. “A lot of businesses have been in crisis mode. What we’re seeing now is them having to get back to a new normal with strategy, boundaries and structure in place.”Some things haven’t changed. As before, high productivity will be a priority – particularly given the gloomy economic predictions. Achieving it depends on motivation, training and technology, time management and support from others. But how can businesses make sure they have these essentials in place as we move out of lockdown and get back to work?Have clarity of purposeWith so much uncertainty around, business leaders need to reassure staff by projecting confidence and clarity wherever possible. “Try to be certain about as much as you can,” says Eyre-White, whether that involves scheduling regular catch-up meetings, or deciding the office won’t reopen until next year. Managers can boost their own productivity and that of their team by being clear about their priorities for any given day or week, and encouraging others to do the same.Aligning those priorities with the company’s objectives will keep even a remote team moving in the right direction, says Chris Bailey, author of Hyperfocus: How to Work Less to Achieve More. “The greatest challenge that businesses face in normal times is orienting what everybody’s working on toward what the purpose of the business is … and that’s still the case,” he says. “The more intentional we are about how we work and what we work on, the more productive we become.”Where priorities have changed, it’s important to communicate that effectively to staff, says Sarah Manning, senior HR director at Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. “I can’t imagine many organisations didn’t have to pivot in some way in lockdown. Leaders need to be really clear now about what the expectation of their teams are going to be and put in measures to help people adapt.”Empower staff to find their way of workingProductivity can be difficult to measure, but focusing on the tasks achieved rather than the hours someone is at their desk can boost efficiency. Despite reports that lockdown led to an upsurge in demand for workforce surveillance tools, Eyre-White says that such an approach is unlikely to be effective. “Inidually, everyone needs to do different things in order to be productive,” she adds. “I just do not see how a surveillance system is compatible with that.”Instead, businesses should be encouraging staff to find what works for them – some people might be most productive if they go for a walk in the morning, others might take short breaks after 45 minutes of focused work, while some team members might need to work around a young family at home.Projecting empathy for the circumstances many of us find ourselves in is important, says Manning. Particularly at present. “Life is crazy right now. I think employers need to acknowledge that.”Promote good communicationWhen it comes to managing virtual teams, good communication is key to ensuring staff feel supported and informed. “Once a company has made a decision, communicate it clearly,” says Manning. “You need to be careful not to go out with half a message and cause a whole lot of anxiety for people.”Keeping communication channels open can promote a culture of collaboration.Apps such as Zoom, Slack, other digital tools and internal help desks can help ensure “people still feel engaged, connected and therefore invested”, says Manning. Zendesk, for example, has held remote quizzes, yoga classes and Friday night drinks during lockdown. There are other examples of companies holding digital book clubs, remote murder mystery games, and scavenger hunts.“Anything you can do as a manager to foster meaningful connections between employees will go a long way,” Bailey says.It’s OK to have down timeStaff may be working from home, but it’s important not to encourage an “always on” culture that blurs the boundaries between work life and home life, Eyre-White says. “There’s this idea of e-presenteeism and needing to be seen,” she adds. “Staff can’t be seen in the office so they may feel they need to be replying to their emails or messages instantly. And that’s not how you get productive work done. You need time away from those things. Businesses need to be clear that it’s OK.”One way to set the tone is to offer training to managers to help them adapt to working with, and supporting, remote teams. Simple measures can set an example, such as resisting the temptation to email outside work hours, and blocking out time for breaks on a calendar that the team has access to.No one should feel guilty about taking a break from work, says Bailey. “Focusing on things all day long is one of the worst things we can do because our mind just needs a chance to wander. Mind the guilt that you experience around relaxation and know that it’s a phenomenon most of us experience.”Embrace flexibilityAlongside the difficulties of the past few months, for many firms there have also been opportunities for lasting change.“If going remote didn’t kill a business, companies are going to have to decide their answer when employees ask: ‘Can I work from home?’” Manning says. “There are huge benefits from a cost perspective … and I do think companies can potentially attract more candidates and more ersity.”Staying flexible – and that might mean some staff work remotely in the long term – will help foster an inclusive, productive culture that has broader benefits.“This has definitely opened our eyes up to those different possibilities,” Manning adds. “We are going to have a much more flexible approach to where people can work and how they work.”Things are changing fast.

While some were pets buried with their owners, millions of animals were killed and mummified as votive offerings to the gods.Now researchers have harnessed a high-resolution, non-invasive 3D imaging technique called X-ray microCT imaging to gain unprecedented insights into animal mummies and the thriving industry that surrounded them.Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, the team report on how they looked inside three animal mummies from the collection of the Egypt Centre at Swansea University: a cat, a bird and a snake.While the latter looks like an oval bundle of rags, the scans revealed it contains a coiled juvenile cobra – a snake of great symbolism to the ancient Egyptians – that had a spinal fracture. The team say that together with damage to the snake’s head, this fits with it being killed by being grabbed by the tail and smashed against a surface like a whip.The head of the mummified cat, which had a painted burial mask, was detached from the rest of the mummy, and the team say scans suggest the animal was less than 18 weeks old and probably domesticated. The animal had been strangled or had its neck broken, potentially so that its head could be positioned upright on the body.Scans of the bird revealed that is was probably a Eurasian kestrel. The cause of its death remains a mystery.The team say the scans also shed light on the lives of the creatures: the cobra appears to have had calcified kidneys, suggesting gout, which has been found in modern snakes kept in poor conditions. Johnston said this and the snake’s young age suggested it could have been reared for sacrifice. The team found the cobra was mummified with its mouth open, and small amounts of a substance called natron seemed to have been placed very precisely in the mouth. Johnston said this potentially suggested a ritual known as “opening of the mouth”.The cobra’s fangs were also missing. While these may simply have fallen out, the team say they could have been removed to prevent injury to the embalmers.Salima Ikram, a professor of Egyptology at the American University in Cairo, who was not involved in the work, said the study was very interesting, “particularly the idea that snakes might have been kept for mummification purposes, as has been posited for cats, dogs and kestrels.”But she said it was unlikely the cobra was the subject of an opening of the mouth ritual. “Putting the natron and resin in the mouth might be to ‘neutralise’ the snake in the afterlife,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecc46c8146265b6331aff770de31578dc99114ed/43_913_4806_2883/master/4806.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1f5f00bcd659d83fe1ec85e4802f240","title":"beverley ditsie the south african woman who helped liberate lesbians everywhere","story":"Growing up in 80s Soweto, Ditsie was immersed in the struggle against apartheid. But she knew racial oppression was only part of the fight – and organised the first Pride march in AfricaBeverley Ditsie first understood what the word “gay” meant while listening to Boy George. She was a teenager in the South African township of Soweto in the early 1980s, obsessed with the UK’s New Romantic movement. In South Africa, people were speculating about the singer’s sexuality, as they were all over the world, and when Ditsie heard that to be gay was to love someone of the same sex, she felt a shock of joy.“I remember this confusion that I’d always had I’d been trying to work out how I’d get over this thing. I always thought I was the only one,” says Ditsie. “I thought: ‘I’m just gay. Oh my God! I’m just gay, everything is OK. I’m just gay.’” For a fleeting moment, Ditsie felt free – something that was almost taboo in a country in turmoil as a result of apartheid. “As a child, you grow up being told you can’t use the word ‘free’ or ‘freedom’, because then you’re a terrorist and so will be taken, beaten, arrested, killed.” In the excitement of the moment, she ran to tell her family, who were having Sunday lunch, that she, too, was gay. She expected them to be pleased. “The look on their faces kind of said: maybe not,” she says with a wry smile and a raised eyebrow.Undeterred, Ditsie and her queer friends in the neighbourhood would dress in the most flamboyant colours, mimicking the style of Boy George’s band, Culture Club. “There was a big group of teenagers who were 13, 14, 15 years old, but you couldn’t tell what gender any of us were,” she says. In the middle of town, they would walk up and down the streets, daring people to say something. “We call those our first Pride,” she says.This was not the first time Ditsie had found a way to escape the strict gender roles of the time. From a young age, she knew she wanted to be a star, to emulate the success of her mother, a famous singer who regularly went on tour. She became a child actor, but was always cast as a boy. This began when her mother was cast as the lead in a TV drama and there was a need for a child who matched her skin tone and looks. To the production company, Ditsie looked like a boy and so was cast as her son. Ditsie loved playing male characters. “I was more me at that time than I’ve ever been,” she says. “Going back to school was weird. It was almost a double life, because here I am now back in school wearing these dresses that I hate, being treated like a girl that I thought I wasn’t.”On her 16th birthday, Ditsie decided to have a coming-out party. One of her friends there told her about Simon Tseko Nkoli, the gay anti-apartheid campaigner. Nkoli had faced the death penalty with 21 other political leaders in the Delmas treason trial, but had been acquitted and released. Ditsie went along to a meeting that Nkoli held at Wits University, in Johannesburg, on a Saturday in September. The teenager had begun to feel something was missing in the anti-apartheid struggle. “Their entire language centred around the emasculation of black men and what freedom for them would mean.” But, she says: “Freedom for black men meant oppression for me, because they were very clear and articulate in their language that as soon as freedom comes, they would ‘get their women back’.”Nkoli on the other hand, “was up there in the front talking about the rights of gay people. That is something I’d never heard before. And coming from somebody who was also a legitimate, anti-apartheid activist … it legitimised all my struggles and all my feelings. For the first time, it embodied what I’d always thought freedom would mean – because for the first time he included my queerness in the equation. So freedom was not just going to mean freedom for me as a black person it would also be freedom for me as a woman, as a gay woman.”She says that Nkoli, who was imprisoned on Robben Island with leaders of the African National Congress (ANC), was so successful because he made the political personal. “Robben Island is also known as the University of the ANC, because it’s the place where a lot of the political leaders who were imprisoned got their degrees. And there was a lot of political education that was going on,” Ditsie says. “Simon kept dropping in sexual orientation and gender equality in those conversations. The political education that would then continue would slowly include sexual orientation just because Simon was there – and he kept saying: ‘If we’re going to create a new constitution in this country, are you willing to exclude me?’“He managed to convince a lot of his fellow inmates – and the rest of the political leadership – of the value of recognising all humans.”The pair became close friends, with Nkoli becoming Ditsie’s mentor. She loved exploring his bookcase, which she describes as a treasure. Through it, she learned about other black lesbian activists such as the US writers and thinkers Audre Lorde and Barbara Smith: “My world was being cracked wide open.” The pair, together with Linda Ngcobo, founded the Gay and Lesbian Organization of Witwatersrand (Glow). The organisation, and particularly Nkoli, was instrumental in enshrining protection for the LGBTQ+ community in South Africa’s new constitution. It was the first country to do so.In 1990, the group decided to organise a Pride march – which had never been done before in South Africa, or indeed in Africa. The night before, Ditsie was listening to a news bulletin on the radio when the march was announced. “I remember the commentator saying: ‘I hope they’ll be safe,’” Ditsie says. The implication that there would be violence terrified the 19-year-old. The organisers even had brown paper bags at the ready – for those who wanted to march, but were too scared to show their face.On the morning of the march, at about 9.30am, she says only 20 people had arrived in the meeting hall. She grew worried, fearing the low numbers made them more vulnerable to attack. As the hours went by, however, people trickled in. By the time they marched, there were more than 100 people. By its end, there were about 800 protesters not a single one wore a brown paper bag.“At one point, I walked away and burst into tears,” says Ditsie. “I cried like a little baby from just the joy of it. I felt like I’d just been born.” Among the chanting participants, some were screaming at the top of their lungs. “I think a lot of us were screaming because of that realisation that we are out in the street saying: ‘We’re here, we’re queer, we’re everywhere!’” Ditsie says. It was a powerful refusal to live in fear in the shadows, something she describes as “half-living”. Decades later, she still does not believe anything will match the euphoria of that day.Yet her joy had a high price. Soon after the march, which was televised, her family started receiving threats. “As much as I regretted the danger to myself, more than that I regretted the danger to my mom and my grandma and my sister. And the rest of my extended family members, who are constantly being asked: ‘How do you allow this?’” Her family, particularly her grandmother – the matriarch of her home and neighbourhood, who had accepted and affirmed her identity in private – defended her in public.She had lived through horrifying violence with her family before. In June 1976, when she was five, she was standing in the family yard in Soweto when she spotted a fire down the road. Her mother, Eaglette Ditsie, simply said: “It’s begun.” She then took Ditsie and her sister, Teboho Letsheleha, inside. “I’ll never forget that,” says Ditsie. She could see teargas and hear gunshots and women screaming. They waited for her grandmother, who lived with them and helped to raise the sisters, to arrive, then boiled buckets of water for protection in case the violence reached them.The fire was from protests students from schools across Soweto were out in the street following a decree from the apartheid government forcing school pupils to learn some subjects in Afrikaans. Police opened fire on the children, killing at least 176 people. A picture of the lifeless body of 12-year-old Hector Pieterson would be seen across the world.Apartheid was part of everyday life. Ditsie remembers the time she and her sister tried to get on a bus after attending Saturday school. The driver allowed Ditsie to get on, but barred her darker-skinned sister. “We walked in that rain,” Ditsie says. “I remember looking at her wondering if it’s the rain or if it’s tears.”Her earliest memories are peppered with incidents that reiterated the simple, yet devastating, message that she was at the bottom of society’s hierarchy. “My activism was born of being aware of all those things,” she says. Ditsie and other members of her family could have been considered “coloured”, which would have meant access to better work and salaries, as well as better schools, hospitals and transport systems. But her family always rejected this categorisation and refused to move from Soweto – which had been created by the South African government to keep black people away from the white suburbs – and refused to tick “coloured” in their identity documents. “For me, freedom meant so much more than just my skin tone, race and culture. It meant so much more.”In 1986, on the 10th anniversary of the massacre, Ditsie joined the Student Representative Council, a group at the forefront of the anti-apartheid movement in Soweto. “Children were beginning to disappear. You’d never know whether it’s because these are people who escaped into the underground army, or were caught by the security police and murdered,” she says. Her grandmother and mother were scared for her, but she was adamant that she had to be part of the struggle.Ditsie’s bravery continued in her fight for gay rights, but after the success of the Pride march she gradually began to feel disenchanted with Glow. Today, intersectionality – the idea that different forms of discrimination can overlap and compound each other – is a widespread, if sometimes contested, idea. While Ditsie may not have known the phrase at the time, she always knew it was the key to toppling oppressive regimes. As a gay, black woman, she says: “The word might be new, but our realities have always been intersectional.”Yet not everyone in Glow seemed to understand this – and lesbian issues, she felt, were being ignored. “I remember at one meeting saying: ‘Why don’t we start with the lesbian issues?’ Then being told: ‘No, those are not as important.’” Even when she raised the alarming news that lesbians were being attacked, raped and murdered, she was sidelined. “I would constantly say: ‘Something else is going on here that is over and above the level of discrimination that gay men face.’ And again, I was disregarded.” The last straw was when, in 1995, she was invited to the fourth UN women’s conference, in Beijing. She was told by Nkoli that it did not have anything to do with Glow or the struggle. “I knew it was time to move on.” She did not speak to him for nearly two years.At the conference, the lesbian caucus was suddenly told that someone could address the UN for five minutes. At the time, homosexuality was still being described as a western invention, “so, in that room, we were quite clear that it cannot be somebody American or Brit. And they cannot be white.” Ditsie stepped up, telling the assembled delegates: “If the World Conference on Women is to address the concerns of all women, it must similarly recognise that discrimination based on sexual orientation is a violation of basic human rights.” The speech marked the first time the UN had been addressed on the need to enshrine LGBTQ+ rights in equality laws.Yet Ditsie wanted her message to reach ordinary people as well as politicians. In the late 90s, she took part in a South African reality TV show called Livewire – Communities. Eight people from across the country lived together for six months. In one particularly tense scene, a white, male cast member told her: “I used to beat up gays, because as far as I’m concerned they don’t belong on Earth.” In reply, Ditsie passionately explained that she was not going anywhere and likened homophobia to the prejudice that the black community continued to face.Why did she agree to such an extreme experiment? It was the lesson she had learned from Nkoli. “People are afraid of what they don’t know,” she says. “Put a face and humanity behind what it is they don’t know and be there to answer their questions. You will have a reaction that’s a hell of a lot better.” By the end of the show, she and the male participant were friends – he even gave her his guitar. But she admits that putting herself on the frontline again and again has taken a significant toll on her mental health.In 1998, at the age of 41, Nkoli died from Aids. The pair reconciled after Nkoli called her one afternoon inviting her to Glow’s 10th anniversary party. “Sometimes forgiveness comes in a phone call that says: ‘Hi, I’m having dinner, you want to come?’” In 2002, she created a moving documentary, entitled Simon and I, about their lives and activism. “He taught me to be true to self,” she says. It’s a legacy that she upholds today.She admits she is still disappointed with the compromises made in South Africa in terms of economic equality. “I think it’s very sad that, in our quest for our own freedoms, we are so OK to be so oppressive to others.” She points to the backlash against trans rights she sees, particularly in the UK. “What kind of intersectionality do you practise that does not see the oppression of others? I am not interested in a system of hierarchy. I am interested in a system where we are equal.”This means she is not surprised that the Black Lives Matter movement was created by queer African American women. “We are constantly the ones that are bringing issues to the fore, because we are the ones that are first affected,” she says. “The day we can say we are free, then everyone around us will also be free.”Her struggle continues – but there is also one more personal goal: to make sure Boy George knows exactly how he changed her life. “I hope that Boy George actually checks this out!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a754cbe567a59a85f33bf637351d57d66d4f26b/0_1109_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=c5ee0f5829cd64ec67ee9987d56a3e5f","title":"azhar ali shaheen afridi naseem shah test england cricket","story":"Azhar Ali will continue to back the two inexperienced quicks in his bowling attack as Pakistan look to level the Test series against England at the Rose Bowl and ease some of the swirling debate that surrounds his captaincy.Pakistan have won two of their seven Tests since Azhar took over from Sarfaraz Ahmed last October and the softly spoken 35-year-old has produced one notable score – 118 against Sri Lanka in Karachi – during an otherwise lean spell with the bat.When England successfully chased 277 at Old Trafford in the first Test, a day on which Azhar was slightly caught in the headlights, it prompted the former all-rounder and captain Wasim Akram, commentating for Sky, to suggest his position was already under pressure for results.But looking forward to Friday’s third Test, Azhar said: “At the moment we are in a very good space and we think we have everything to win the final match. As a player, a professional and a captain you have to look at the challenge ahead of you.“I’m lucky to have such a nice bunch of guys who are putting everything in for Pakistan. They have gelled really nicely, which makes the job very easy for me, so I focus on all the strategies. I’m enjoying it. Hopefully we can win this Test and move forward from there.”From the outside Pakistan do appear united and their performance in the first half of the first Test, along with the little action witnessed during the soggy second, suggests they are more than capable of avoiding a first series defeat to England in 10 years.Mohammad Abbas enjoyed the conditions during the first outing in Southampton and though Shaheen Afridi and Naseem Shah are 20 and 17 respectively, Azhar wants to further their education rather than draft in a more experienced seamer such as Sohail Khan, who took two five-wicket hauls during the warm-up games.Azhar said: “Shaheen and Naseem are exciting characters and you can’t buy experience without playing. We have to back them, they are bowling really well, putting the opposition under pressure.“At the end of last year we were struggling for fast bowlers when we went to Australia they have taken up the challenge and impressed everyone around the world. They have so much potential, experience will come. I still feel they are good enough to win Test matches.”Pakistan have confirmed Mohammad Yousuf has been appointed batting coach at their national high performance centre in Lahore. The 45-year-old scored 24 centuries during a 12-year Test career that ended in 2010.

Love, though, made it look like little more than an exercise gallop here on Thursday, as the dual Classic winner outclassed her field to win by five lengths and take over as the clear favourite for the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in October.Love is now top-priced at 5-2 to become the fourth three-year-old filly to win the Arc in the last 10 years, and while heavy ground at Longchamp could still be a problem, Thursday’s race removed any doubts about her ability to act on good-to-soft. Enable, the Arc winner in 2017 and 2018 before finishing second last season, is 3-1 while Ghaiyyath, a dominant winner of Wednesday’s International Stakes here, is 6-1. Aidan O’Brien, Love’s trainer, suggested after the race that he had been worried about a combination of slow ground and a lack of peak fitness, 47 days after her emphatic success in the Oaks. His fears proved groundless, prompting O’Brien to suggest afterwards that he has never had a better filly at this stage of their career. “We would have treated this as her first run back in the autumn,” O’Brien said, “so you would think and hope that she would progress again from today. She’s been doing that from run to run, she’s getting bigger and wider and stronger. She was always very exciting, I don’t know whether we’ve ever had as exciting a filly at this stage.

That’s the plan anyway.”A fresh pitch awaits the two sides, despite fears the rain may force the same one to be used again, and Root, though cagey about his XI, admitted there was “a good chance at least one” of Archer or Mark Wood will play, making Sam Curran the possible fall guy.Under further questioning he certainly gave the impression that Archer is down to play and, with Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad once again sharing the new ball, the 25-year-old’s role has been told his role in the side is simple.Though English cricket still faces a loss of £107m, and the women’s team remains fixtureless unless a late touring team comes forward, the staging of six Test matches has been something of a triumph given the uncertainty at the start of the pandemic.Root said: “We were dreading the thought of not seeing international cricket and so to be at the back end of the Test part is credit to everyone involved. It’s made for entertaining viewing at times and I expect nothing less in this final fixture.“I remember walking out for my first innings on a hat-trick ball and it was deadly silent. It was bizarre. One more week, one more big push and hopefully we can sign off with a win.”Root described himself as “impressed” with the team’s progress this summer even if, bowling-wise, the attack has leant heavily on Broad, Chris Woakes and, to a slightly lesser extent, Jimmy Anderson. There was an admission of some frustration that the surfaces have meant that Dom Bess has only bowled in three of the five Tests to date, with Root hoping he has “an opportunity to play to make a real impact” and adding “he’s done the best he can.”He added: “We know we have hurdles to overcome and things that we want to get better at if we are going to be that No 1 team in the world. But the mindset we have and the work ethic gives us the best chance of getting there. I can certainly see this group of players going on to do that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73a2374d1fb10903736722f113189ca1da147561/69_369_2718_1631/master/2718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7108d9cf56698d1577e224e733714065","title":"edinburgh stranded fringe stars in pictures","story":"The cancellation of this year’s Edinburgh festival and fringe left many performers without a stage – so Richard Davenport shot the saucy sea witches and confused sheep closer to home instead "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2fe19fd67bca653c753499a8cadf6d48eaffd/0_0_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a66804da8d76926a240da37d432a04","title":"hybrid cars have to be plugged in and five other common misconceptions","story":"Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7eed2517ce95109b44470ae254ec1f9c2db2763/37_0_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04f01bda6e4d42a5f3a5bee5ef0219e3","title":"uk parks and free public gardens readers travel tips","story":"The haven of peace and beauty that a green space offers has never been more important.

It has not only stunning outside areas, including a Chinese garden, but also glasshouses (though these are still currently closed to the public). An army of volunteers, the “Friends of Treborth Botanic Garden” help keep it looking its best and run plant sales and other events.

It’s always a thrill slipping in through the anonymous-looking green door in the red-brick wall to discover the secret it’s keeping – towering herbaceous borders that are simply breathtaking. If this was all there was to see, you’d potter home more than happy. But it’s only the entrance and the long path leads to a haven of tranquillity blooming with many more delights and surprises including … but I’ll leave them for you to discover. StuartMount Edgcumbe Country Park in Torpoint, Cornwall, is the estate of a Tudor house overlooking Plymouth Sound and the River Tamar, now owned by Cornwall and Plymouth councils. The trip to get there on the little Cremyll foot ferry – bicycles accepted – from Plymouth is part of the fun (there’s also the Torpoint car ferry). The Grade I-listed gardens include rose, American, French, Italian and New Zealand gardens, a dell with tree ferns and the national camellia collection. There are spectacular views from the folly, a walk along the South West Coast Path to Kingsand village, two cafes (now open, with Covid-safe practices), and craft shops in the old stables.Elinor ScottThe Quarry park in Shrewsbury has been the perfect place to picnic and promenade since the 17th century, when the ladies of the town would enjoy a stroll along the banks of the River Severn, which loops elegantly around it. Today the public park has lost none of its charm and is easily reachable from the city centre. The jewel in its crown is the Dingle, a sunken flower garden with thousands of blooms sending lovely fragrances into the air, a credit to the town’s longtime parks superintendent, Percy Thrower. Follow the one-way system as you stroll and enjoy a homemade ice-cream at the Quarry cafe as you pass.YasminAysgarth Edwardian Rock Garden in Wensleydale is a Grade II-listed enchanting grotto of huge blocks of weathered limestone, with a spring-fed waterfall and 300 varieties of plants including ferns and alpines. It was commissioned in the Edwardian era by Frank Sayer Graham, a game dealer who made his money in silver rabbit furs and rare gulls’ eggs, to show off his wealth and plant knowledge. Lovingly restored, it’s a little oasis of charm and peace, open daily. Bridget MellorLeeds council’s Temple Newsam park has rhododendron walks, ornamental lakes, laburnum arches, bluebell woods and formal gardens. Tucked away, and missed by many, is a superb 18th-century walled garden. Red bricks shelter stunning borders and central rose beds. I like to walk through the bougainvillea-filled glasshouse, pause to marvel at the varieties of coleus in the national collection, then sit on one of the many benches surrounded by a medley of scents and the buzz of the apiary’s bees. There are fees to enter the historic house and rare-breed farm, but the gardens and parkland are free. Debbie RollsMy favourite public garden is Southover Grange in Lewes. This garden played an important part in my life for many years and I feel nostalgic just thinking about it! It’s the garden of Southover Grange house, built in 1542, where the diarist John Evelyn once lived. The garden is ided into several “rooms” around the old house. There’s a lawn with an ancient mulberry tree, the Winterbourne stream running through, and colourful flowerbeds. The garden teas are another major attraction – sit on a bench with a cup of tea and delicious cake.Jane GoldingEnter the House of Dun walled garden and it’s easy to imagine you are a fine Edwardian lady taking a promenade around the formal yet cottage-style garden. Rose-covered arbours dotted around the sun-warmed stone walls are the perfect spot to sit and relax. Breathing in jasmine, sweet peas and roses, the years slip away and you could be of any time. Gazing at the windows, you can ponder the lives lived within, from the grand rooms to the servants’ attics. All had at least a most beautiful view. Buildings, cafe, shop and toilets are closed, but the gardens are free to enter. Katrina BruceStarbank Park on the beautiful coast in Edinburgh is a wee hidden gem! With views clear across the Firth of Forth, on a sunny day there is nothing like it. A team of passionate and green-fingered volunteers maintain stunning floral beds in the front park, and climbing the steep bank to the top rewards you with a different type of garden: of carefully curated trees and all variety of blooms. The park even hosts two mini free libraries – one for adults and one for smaller readers. Everyone is welcome to spend time in the peaceful rose garden or lost in thought gazing out to sea. It’s simply gorgeous!Victoria BuchananThe Peter Beales rose gardens in Attleborough, Norfolk, are brilliant for all the family and free to enter all year round. Beautiful rose arches are magnificent if you visit in the summer: the smell itself is enough to keep everyone entranced. It’s also accessible: our youngest son has severe learning difficulties and the gardens were very accommodating to his needs when we visited. There is a restaurant, but it was a bit crowded the day we went so we did not use it, though prices were competitive and the menu looked inviting. There is also a shop selling plants and flowers.

The coronavirus shut down production of his TV series Lucifer. He is recovering from surgery following some sort of food reaction – he won’t be drawn on details, saying only: “I have a beef with beef.” Most importantly of all, though, his children are thousands of miles away, in the UK. He shares custody with his ex-wife, the EastEnders star Tamzin Outhwaite, and was scheduled to visit them after filming wrapped on Lucifer’s fifth season, Then the outbreak hit, which meant that he has had to go seven months without seeing them.“It’s been excruciating,” he confides over Zoom from his home in Los Angeles. “There is a part of you that isn’t there when they’re not around.” However, as we speak, he is preparing to fly back for a long-awaited reunion part of a complex transportation schedule that involves several flights back and forth across the Atlantic, punctuated by quarantine on either side. His thoughts keep returning to the UK.Ellis’s brush with the American healthcare system has made him nostalgic for the NHS. “People here just avoid going to the doctor, because they can’t bear the consequences that might happen financially,” he says. The halt in Lucifer’s production, along with its imminent conclusion (the sixth series will be its last), has him longing to return to the London stage. “It’s like rehab for acting,” he says. Ellis name checks UK delights such as ’Allo ’Allo, the snooker and Challenge Anneka. As if to underline the yearning for his homeland, he is wearing a Three Lions baseball cap. And yet, while Ellis is recognised across the world, in the UK, he is best remembered for a near-decade-old sitcom.We are here to talk about Lucifer, the show that has kept him in the US, and is about to return to Netflix for its fifth season. This is a big deal. A TV Time study last year found that the series is more successful than anything else streaming in the world, beating even the monolith that is Stranger Things. But Lucifer’s popularity is not totally global. When I told people in the UK that I was going to interview Tom Ellis from Lucifer, I was met primarily with blank stares. Then I would say, “You know, Miranda’s boyfriend,” and the pieces would fall into place. Ellis, you suspect, is used to this reaction.Lucifer is a deceptively odd programme – imagine Murder, She Wrote, but with the devil playing the part of Jessica Fletcher – but part of its charm is its refusal to die. In 2018, after three seasons of middling success, Lucifer was cancelled by its network, Fox. Ellis was at a fan convention in Rome when he learned of its fate. “I’d just come off stage doing my Q\u0026ampA with the audience,” he recalls. “And then the call came through. I was at my lowest ebb when I found out about it.”Fourteen hours later, however, the cancellation was made public and all hell broke loose. Fans of Lucifer – Lucifans, if we really must – started a frantic grassroots campaign to save the show. The following day, Peter Roth, the head of TV at Warner Bros (who produced the show), called Ellis to say: “We are aware of this reaction and we are looking to find a new home for it.” Ellis threw his weight behind the cause, even appearing on Newsnight to spread the word.“It was a strange time, because I was putting myself out there against my better judgment,” he says. “Against the advice of some of my team, even. Everyone kept saying: ‘It’s very, very unlikely that this will happen.’ And I’m still going: ‘So you’re saying there’s a chance?’”The cavalry appeared in the form of Netflix, reacting to the outcry with an offer to wrap up the show with a two-season deal. So, after saying goodbye to Lucifer, Ellis returned for a fourth season, during which the show’s popularity exploded around the world. The scale of that success seems to be something he is still processing.Netflix feels like the natural home for Lucifer. The episodes are longer and looser and shaggier there, less crushed by the regimented demands of an ad-driven US network. I was not a total fan in its Fox days, but on Netflix it is a different matter. It is stranger and funnier now (and dirtier, too Ellis’s bare bottom is onscreen so much that it deserves separate billing) and much more willing to take big swings. The forthcoming season contains a musical episode, a black-and-white episode and an episode in which the obnoxious showrunner of a fictional version of Lucifer gets murdered. Oh, and Ellis gets to play Lucifer and Lucifer’s twin brother. The new series is so much fun, in fact, that just as Ellis was preparing to say goodbye to the character all over again, Netflix swooped in once more.“I’d planned to spend this season in my own grieving process,” he says. “And then, right towards the end, literally as we’d already devised how we would end our show, we had a call from Netflix saying: ‘Would you like to go another season?’”The Lucifer showrunners agreed and, when the Covid regulations lift, Lucifer will finish shooting season five before rolling straight into season six. That, Ellis maintains, will really be it. “I know we’re the Lazarus of TV shows, but this is definitely going to be the final season,” he insists.As he has had to face the end of his show twice now, I wonder whether Ellis has had chance to think of what to do next. There are plans for more television, with his wife, Meaghan Oppenheimer – creator of the Facebook series Queen America – and with Jason Bateman’s production company. However, he says: “Again, the big one for me is theatre.”Theatre, after all, is where he started, as a self-proclaimed “horny 16-year-old” lured into his school’s theatre class by the number of girls there. From there came school plays and encouraging feedback from one of his mother’s actor friends. “And then I got a place at the Royal Scottish Academy,” he recalls. “I went to Glasgow for three years and had the time of my life and that was it.”He sighs, his mind returning to Covid. “Obviously, that is just a tricky thing to talk about with anyone that works in the theatre at the moment. But, obviously, I believe the theatre is not going to die. It’s going to come back. And I want to be part of that.”That is still some way off. First, he has a season and a bit of Netflix’s most popular show to make. More pressingly, he has his children to visit. “I don’t ever really want to be in that headspace ever again,” he says. “Trying to remain positive while the world is falling apart and having your children away from you and not knowing you will see them was just …” He pauses, trying to find the right words, then sighs. “Yeah,” he smiles sadly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e447623f5529ab11bd2f9800447a49a334c89c0e/0_132_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad9a8cdc4d9a55021d3ca3ccf1ae3791","title":"kamala harris dnc speech vice president","story":"Democratic nominee urges voters to reject Donald Trump and says: ‘We can do better and deserve so much more’Kamala Harris, a California senator and daughter of immigrants who has broken racial barriers at every step of her political career, made US history on Wednesday night as she became the first Black woman and first Asian American to formally accept a major party’s vice-presidential nomination.In the most consequential speech of her career to date, Harris urged voters to reject the isive and destructive leadership of Donald Trump, calling him a president who “turns our tragedies into political weapons”.“We’re at an inflection point,” the 55 year-old said, speaking from a waterfront convention center near Joe Biden’s home in Wilmington, Delaware.“The constant chaos leaves us adrift. The incompetence makes us feel afraid. The callousness makes us feel alone,” she continued. “It’s a lot – and here’s the thing: we can do better and deserve so much more.”Harris’s sister Maya, her niece Meena, and her step-daughter Ella Emhoff offered their praise of Harris as she was formally nominated, and her address introduced Harris to a nation still largely unfamiliar with the California senator.Moments before she spoke, Harris stood at a darkened podium as a technician checked the sound. She took a deep breath. The cameraman counted down to zero and the lights above her illuminated.Born in 1964 to Shyamala Gopalan, an Indian-born American cancer researcher, and Donald Harris, an American economist from Jamaica, Harris recounted their political activism and said that some of her earliest memories were of attending civil rights protests as a toddler.She described her family – both the one she was born into and the one she created – as foundational to her life and career, bringing some Indian-American women watching at home to tears with a mention of her chithis. Acknowledging the weight of nomination, she invoked her mother, along with the names of Black, female civil rights leaders who helped pave the way: “We all stand on their shoulders.”“My mother taught me that service to others gives life purpose and meaning. And oh, how I wish she were here tonight but I know she’s looking down on me from above. I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman – all of five feet tall – who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California,” she said.“On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice-president of the United States of America.”In her remarks, Harris also delivered a biting rebuke of Donald Trump, or, as she calls it, “prosecuting the case” against the president of the United States.She said: “Donald Trump’s failure of leadership has cost lives and livelihoods. If you’re a parent struggling with your child’s remote learning, or you’re a teacher struggling on the other side of that screen, you know that what we’re doing right now isn’t working.“And we are a nation that’s grieving. Grieving the loss of life, the loss of jobs, the loss of opportunities, the loss of normalcy. And yes, the loss of certainty.”Her speech threaded together the two major arguments Democrats have advanced across their four-day convention: that American democracy hung in the balance – and that voters must mobilize in historic numbers ahead of the November election to ensure not only that Trump is denied a second term but that Democrats take control with a governing mandate.“It’s not about Joe or me. It’s about you. It’s about us,” Harris said. “People of all ages and colors and creeds who are, yes, taking to the streets, and also persuading our family members, rallying our friends, organizing our neighbors, and getting out the vote.”“And we’ve shown that, when we vote, we expand access to healthcare, expand access to the ballot box, and ensure that more working families can make a decent living.”As Wednesday’s event began, Harris gave a brief direct-to-camera speech about the importance of voting in November’s election. She said she knew many of the viewers may have “heard about obstacles and misinformation, and folks making it harder for you to cast your ballot,” offering implicit criticism of Trump.Harris, only the fourth woman in history to be nominated for a presidential ticket, shared a virtual stage – one hundred years and one day after the ratification of the 19th amendment that guaranteed the women – with Hillary Clinton, the first woman nominated by a major party for the presidency, and Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker and highest ranking woman in American political history.After graduating from Howard University, a historically Black college in Washington DC, Harris pursued a career in criminal justice. In 2003, she was elected district attorney of San Francisco and the attorney general of California before becoming only the second Black woman to serve in the Senate.It is this chapter of her career that Harris struggled to reconcile during her own presidential campaign, when confronted by progressives over her record as a prosecutor.But on Wednesday, Democrats mostly celebrated her historic ascensions. Harris’s presence on stage Wednesday was not preordained.During the first Democratic primary debate last year, Harris confronted Biden over his past opposition to school bussing policies and his working relationship with segregationist senators. The attack wounded Biden, who had centered his campaign around the promise to restore the soul of the nation.After her own presidential campaign fizzled and she dropped out of the race last year, Harris returned to the Senate, where she found her voice in the midst of nationwide protests over racial injustice. She joined protesters on the street and delivered a deeply personal speech on the Senate floor about being Black in America. She sponsored police reform legislation and championed a bill to make lynching a federal crime.On Wednesday, Harris’s speech capped the third night of the Democrats’ national convention, which moved almost entirely online due to the coronavirus pandemic.Barack Obama, who used his speech to warned that Trump poses a threat to American democracy, and urged voters to turn out, was originally scheduled to speak last, but he asked to switch slots so he would precede Harris, in a symbolic passing of the torch, according to a Democratic official.When Harris concluded, she turned to face a screen, which displayed Hollywood-squares style boxes with women from around the country applauding.Harris clasped her hand to her heart and waved back, though the videos were pre-recorded. Joe Biden appeared on stage.

The question is who will be standing on them. The obvious answer, for a few years at least, would be Biden, the prospective Oval Office occupant.But for some Democrats watching Harris’ acceptance speech at the national convention on Wednesday night, in which she spoke personally about racial justice, immigration and gender equality – exactly the key planks of the party platform – the identity of the new leader of the Democratic party was equally obvious, and it was not Biden.“That I am here tonight is a testament to the dedication of generations before me,” said Harris, the first woman of color on a major-party presidential ticket. “Women and men who believed so fiercely in the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all.”Just as Harris, the daughter of Jamaican and South Asian immigrants, embodies a future the Democratic party has aligned with – nonwhite, non-male, pluralistic, non-dynastic – her speech reached corners of the party identity that no one else in speeches to the convention, not even Barack Obama, could touch.Harris’ acceptance speech had the familiar cadence of a political speech, but it was full of lines that were totally new in the mouth of an elected official on the presidential stage. Harris used the phrase “structural racism” to describe why Black, Latino and Indigenous people are “suffering and dying disproportionately” from Covid-19. She called out “the injustice in reproductive and maternal healthcare”.Praising her mother, the potential future vice-president said: “She raised us to be proud, strong Black women. And she raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage.”The focus on Harris as the potential standard-bearer for Democrats owes in part to Biden’s age. At 77, he would be the oldest person ever to be sworn in for a first term as president, and speculation has abounded that he would serve a single term if elected.Setting aside the significant question of whether the vice-presidency automatically elevates a politician as the party’s leader – Biden himself might differ – Harris faces obstacles to capturing the heart of a party invigorated by calls for generational change.She failed to attract significant Democratic support as a presidential candidate in her own right earlier this year. Her perceived coziness with law enforcement and perceived failure to challenge wrongful convictions as attorney general of California have drawn criticism from progressives, who harbor some skepticism about her incarnation on the campaign trail as a warrior for equal justice.“Women of color, particularly progressives, might feel torn,”  columnist Derecka Purnell wrote earlier this month. “Progressives will have to defend the California senator’s personal identity, while maneuvering against her political identity.”At 55, Harris is two decades younger than Biden, and in something of an historic sweet spot age-wise for presidential candidates – but the intensity of the party’s progressive wing could focus an increasing amount of Democratic energy behind a younger leader, closer to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s generation than Harris’.Whether Harris’ biggest moment is yet to come, she is in the middle of a moment now. In his speech Wednesday night, Obama described her as a “friend” and “an ideal partner” for Biden “who’s more than prepared for the job”.“We’re at an inflection point,” Harris said. She was talking about the promise of equal justice under the law, but she could have been talking about the future of Democratic party politics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e41b7bd0ebcd3932601075014c4f8de004ffaf2/0_456_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e32cd8d2befe4121ac024677d49ef4e","title":"coronavirus cases in england increase by 27 in a week","story":"Number of people testing positive hits highest level since mid-June despite fall in testsBirmingham’s infection rate has seen a sharp jump from 30 cases per 100,000, up from 22.4 the week before. West Midlands police are openly discussing the prospect of a city-wide lockdown if the situation does not improve, and the city’s director of public health described the rise as dramatic.Dr Justin Varney said he expected the city to be put on the national ‘watchlist’, published tomorrow, which details the local authorities with the highest weekly incidence rate.“I expect we will be on that national list and will go on as an area of ‘enhanced support’ – that is not the level that Leicester and Greater Manchester are in, but the level below that - think Northamptonshire, Blackburn, areas like that, certainly over the next week,” he said.“What we do in the next seven days will decide if we go into lockdown or not. If we do it will be for at least two or three weeks, and that will be devastating.”Superintendent Gareth Morris from West Midlands police said in a blog post: “The impact on people’s lives and businesses has already been so significantly affected by the national lockdown, that we must try and do all we can to prevent that occurring in Birmingham and taking us into a state of city wide lockdown.” He urged people to follow the guidelines and social distancing.The following groups of people can\u0026nbspask for a test through the NHS website:The following groups of people can access priority testing through the gov.uk website:The government has published guidance on\u0026nbsptesting for essential workers\u0026nbspand the\u0026nbsplist of essential workers\u0026nbspbelow.The government says that tests for essential workers are prioritised over the tests available for the wider public through the NHS.The latest Test and Trace figures, published on Thursday, show the majority of positive tests were carried out in community settings, known as “pillar two”, with people swabbing themselves using home kits or attending regional and mobile testing units.The rise in positive cases in pilar one testing is likely to cause particular concern among health planners as it could indicate an increase in the number of people who are feeling ill enough to seek medical attention.“The fact that positive diagnoses have risen at a time when the number of tests are remaining fairly static does suggest that the incidence of Covid-19 in the community is now beginning to rise again,” said Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the Norwich School of Medicine at the University of East Anglia.“Clearly if this trend continues the demands on the test-track-and-trace service and on the NHS will increase over the coming weeks.”The figures follow the outbreak at the Greencore sandwich factory in Northampton, which gave the town England’s highest infection rate between 9 and 16 August of 116.6 per 100,000 people, up from 38.7 the previous week.In Oldham, where local leaders have been resisting a return to some lockdown measures, the rate dropped from 105.4 to 84.3, with 200 new cases. Blackburn with Darwen is third in the list where the rate has risen very slightly from 74.2 to 76.2 per 100,000. Other areas which recorded week-on-week jumps include Manchester, up from 37.8 to 49.0, Salford, up from 24.3 to 36.7, and Bury, up from 25.1 to 33.0, all in the north-west.The latest figures, released on Thursday, show no progress in improving the contract tracing part of the system. The number of people testing positive whose cases were referred to the tracing system fell slightly to 4,803, mainly due to a delay in processing that resulted in 681 people not having their cases transferred promptly.Meanwhile in Scotland, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told Holyrood that Scotland would remain in stage three of the plan for easing of lockdown restrictions, as she announced that there had been 77 new cases of coronavirus since yesterday, the highest number of new cases over a 24-hour period in nearly three months.Sturgeon said there were 27 new cases in Tayside overnight, where the cluster linked to the 2 Sisters chicken processing factory in Coupar Angus has now reached 43 positive cases in total.Sturgeon said 37 of the cases in the “significant” cluster were employees and the six others were their contacts, adding that further restrictions on the local area were being “urgently” considered. The army has a mobile testing unit in place and the factory has closed for two weeks while all 900 staff are urged to get tested.Sturgeon said: “This number will almost certainly grow, we are stressing the importance of all workers at the plant self-isolating and getting tested. Given the nature and potential scale of this outbreak, we are considering carefully and urgently whether further restrictions are necessary.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50c59565cbdc29e802e0c1f45b7f6d1e7a690cb0/453_54_2565_1539/master/2565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b9334ea4cff1fb8e4dc60de4bdbcf3f","title":"end of eviction ban in england and wales could cause covid surge","story":"Doctors and health officials warn in letter of impact of homelessness ‘avalanche’Senior doctors and health officials have said an “avalanche” of homelessness could drive up Covid-19 infection rates if the government fails to extend the ban on housing evictions introduced under lockdown.Signatories to a letter sent to the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, include representatives of the British Medical Association, the Royal College of GPs, the Royal College of Physicians and the Faculty of Public Health.“As public health organisations, we are deeply concerned that failure to prevent an evictions and homelessness crisis could significantly contribute to an increase of Covid-19 infections,” the letter says.The moratorium on evictions in England and Wales – introduced by ministers in March, and then extended in June until 23 August – has provided a breathing space for tenants who have run up rent arrears during the pandemic after their incomes fell as a result of furlough, shielding, or job loss, it says.“Now that these measures are being withdrawn, we are deeply concerned that the government does not have an adequate plan to address the growing rent debt crisis and to prevent a catastrophic wave of evictions and homelessness as we head towards autumn and winter.”It adds: “People forced into overcrowded temporary or emergency accommodation by eviction are at greatly increased risk of being unable to isolate if needed, face greater challenges in following social distancing guidelines and may lack adequate access to basic hygiene measures shown to reduce infection rates.”Housing has been a key determinant in the unequal impact of Covid-19 on BAME households, the letter says. The virus has thrived in areas where social deprivation is highest and housing affordability is lowest, such as London, and has had a disproportionate effect on migrant workers with no recourse to public funds.Daniel J Carter, an epidemiologist and member of health campaigners Medact, said: “The gap in government’s policy to protect renters increases the public health risk. If you cannot pay your rent, you may fear eviction. If you fear eviction, you may continue to travel and work. If you continue to travel and work, you may inadvertently acquire or spread Covid-19. And if enough people continue to spread the virus, a second wave of the pandemic looks inevitable.”Earlier this week a poverty inquiry found that poor housing, overcrowding and high rents in the London borough of Brent, one of the UK’s most deprived areas, had helped turn it into a hotspot for Covid-19 deaths. Brent has the worst Covid death rate in England and Wales per 100,000 population, with 490 deaths to the end of July.The doctors’ letter, puts further pressure on the government, which has been heavily lobbied to extend the ban in recent weeks by campaigners, MPs, and the mayor of London.Chris Norris, policy director for the NRLA, said: “Extending the ban on repossessions is not necessary. Our research clearly shows that the vast majority of landlords and tenants are working together constructively to sustain tenancies wherever possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5d65cc7a62ba401d9b81f4177ea09cb8db0fa49/0_51_5648_3388/master/5648.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=531decbdbdd27f81fcdaf4ba63509d52","title":"government spends 56m on consultants to help with coronavirus","story":"Contracts given to big firms include £14,000 a day to create replacement for Public Health EnglandWhitehall departments have spent more than £56m on consultancy firms to help deal with the coronavirus pandemic, mostly without giving other companies the chance to compete for the work, the  and openDemocracy can reveal.Sixteen private consultancy firms, including major companies such as Deloitte, PwC, Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey have been working at the heart of the government’s response to the virus.They have been rapidly hired to work on the track-and-trace system, the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the search to produce working ventilators.Among the contracts given to McKinsey, was one where its consultants were paid £563,000 for six weeks’ work – £14,000 a day – to create a permanent replacement for Public Health England, helping define its “vision, purpose and narrative”.Whitehall departments have not published a full inventory of contracts that have been awarded to firms during the pandemic, despite official guidelines that they should be made public within 30 days.However, dozens of unpublished contracts have been leaked to the , which analysed them in partnership with openDemocracy.The leaked information, alongside that contained in public registers of contracts, reveals the scale of public money being spent by the civil service on consultants, who can charge hundreds of pounds an hour in fees for their services.Meg Hillier MP, the chair of the public accounts committee, which scrutinises Whitehall spending, said she would write and ask the government for more details of the contracts, as she believed that the lack of transparency was “sloppy”.She questioned why Whitehall was outsourcing to consultancy firms “bread and butter work that the government should be doing”.Tom Sasse, a researcher at the Institute for Government, a thinktank which has examined the use of consultants by the government, said: “As numbers in the civil service have been significantly cut back in recent years, we have seen government departments rely more and more on consultants. But it is not always clear that these consultants are being used well or where they can add value.”During the pandemic, ministers have used special powers to bypass normal tendering rules, allowing public bodies ranging from Whitehall departments to local councils to give contracts quickly to commercial companies such as consultancy firms without requiring them to organise an open competition.The usual rules were suspended in March at the start of the outbreak under an obscure piece of legislation which public bodies have used to avoid lengthy tendering processes in many cases.A confidential Whitehall document shows that government departments are continuing to give contracts to consultancy firms and other commercial companies without competition. The Cabinet Office said the government was shifting away from awarding contracts to private companies without a tender.The big consultancy firms have been awarded a series of multimillion-pound contracts.Deloitte has been given contracts worth at least £8m from four Whitehall departments. It was hired to help set up a network of drive-through rapid testing centres which were designed to be the backbone of the government’s plan to control the spread of coronavirus.However, there was criticism that failings led to the test results of NHS staff being lost or sent to the wrong person, leading to some hospitals discussing whether to take over one of the testing centres from Deloitte.The firm says it does not run or manage the testing centres, but supported the Department of Health to accelerate testing capacity.Deloitte was also hired by the Cabinet Office to advise on the procurement of personal protective equipment from the UK and abroad. Some figures in the UK manufacturing industry accused Deloitte of pursuing factories in China, where prices have leapt and supply is tight, rather than on focusing on improving production from UK factories.PwC, another big consultancy firm, is being paid up to £3m by the Cabinet Office to provide financial advice until the end of the year. The Treasury has also given the firm a contract, worth up to £2.5m, for advice over six months.PwC has a £1.4m, six-month contract from the culture department to help run a £200m emergency coronavirus fund for small charities struggling to survive the impact of the crisis on their regular fundraising. Some charity leaders have questioned the need for PwC to be involved in the fund.A PwC spokesman said: “We have made the breadth of our capabilities and skills available to rapidly support the critical work of the public sector at a time of national crisis.”Another consultancy firm, Ernst \u0026amp Young, was awarded two £400,000 contracts to manage publicity around the programme to track and trace people who are potentially infected with the virus, and to improve the purchase of PPE.The NHS hired consultants from KPMG to help build the temporary Nightingale hospitals. The hospitals were to treat coronavirus patients so that other NHS hospitals were not overwhelmed.The Department for International Development gave Boston Consulting Group a £4.5m contract to help support poor countries in the fight against the virus.Consultancy firms, including Cambridge Consultants, were also given millions to take part in Boris Johnson’s wartime-style appeal to British companies to produce large numbers of ventilators.A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “As part of an unprecedented response to this global pandemic we have drawn on the expertise of a number of private sector partners. This is completely in line with procurement regulations for exceptional circumstances, where being able to procure at speed has been critical in the national response to Covid-19.“We have been clear from the outset that public authorities must achieve value for taxpayers’ money and use good commercial judgment when awarding contracts. The publication of contract information is being carried out as quickly as possible in line with transparency guidelines.”Tamzen Isacsson, chief executive of the consulting industry’s lobbying body, the Management Consultancies Association, said: “Since the outbreak of Covid-19, government departments have faced an unprecedented volume of workload and using external resources has enabled the government to work quickly and with intensity on major initiatives across the UK.“At short notice we’ve been able to bring world-class technical expertise and multi-disciplinary capabilities and it has been our priority to strengthen the UK government’s response, processes, and provide value for money to government departments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3bbd35c4874726e6f3352c20a58393f079e450f/0_186_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f5d3104e7766381abb61be513260de35","title":"three quarters of new zealand public intend to get covid vaccine study finds","story":"Population has higher willingness to get vaccinated than residents of Britain, the US and GermanyThree quarters of New Zealanders intend to get immunised against coronavirus when a vaccine becomes available, new research has found.“New Zealand has used the coronavirus outbreak to build public trust in experts and in government’s ability to respond to crisis, whereas other countries have squandered, or even undermined, an opportunity to build public trust in scientific expertise,” said Dr Jagadish Thaker at the School and Journalism and Communication.“When people make decisions with limited or uncertain information – such as the availability and efficacy of a Covid vaccine – trust in experts is probably the most significant factor in shaping public attitudes and intentions.”More than 1,000 people took part in the survey, and showed more willingness than comparative nations to trying a vaccine if and when it became available.“While these are not (an) apples to apples comparison, New Zealanders appear to have slightly higher intensions to vaccinate against Covid-19,” said Thaker.Around the world, more than 170 teams of researchers are racing to develop a safe and effective vaccine.Vaccines normally require years of testing and additional time to produce at scale, but scientists are hoping to develop a coronavirus vaccine within 12 to 18 months.Last week the Russian president, Vladmir Putin, said his country had become the first country to grant regulatory approval to a Covid-19 vaccine for human use, but scientists voiced concern that Russian researchers had jumped the gun.On Wednesday Australia’s prime minister Scott Morrison backtracked after announcing he would make a potential Covid-19 vaccine “mandatory”, later saying instead that it would be “encouraged”.New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said a vaccine would not be mandatory in New Zealand, telling local television: “Once we have that vaccination available and out then it is on everyone’s inidual risk – if they choose not to they are putting their own health at risk. Because we would of course remove other controls that have stopped the spread.”“As the world prepares for a reliable and safe vaccine against coronavirus, it is important that public health experts are prepared to respond to public scepticism and hesitancy about the coronavirus vaccine,” Thaker said.Other reasons stated include it being the best way to avoid getting seriously ill, to feel safe around other people, to protect their community, to return to normality, on a doctors’ recommendation, or because of a chronic health condition.Reasons cited by those not wanting to get the vaccine say they need more time to assess the safety of it, they were concerned about the possible side effects, or they feared getting infected with coronavirus from the vaccine itself.“Other open comments on reasons to not get a coronavirus vaccine include lack of trust, belief in conspiracy theories and a feeling that the testing is rushed,” said Dr Vishnu Menon, co-author of the research.“However, they would need reassurance about the safety of a newly introduced vaccine,” adding that more than half of New Zealanders said they were uncomfortable getting a vaccine that was rushed into production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b63dcb2875e788f4ba56c6cfdf51ad120c9df1d4/0_156_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=470d7428b97b1a7a67c9dc74398e63f7","title":"uk coronavirus covid 19 england students gcse results btec controversy live news","story":"Shapps announces change as Portugal added to Covid safe list Birmingham ‘likely to join Covid watch list’ as cases rise Sturgeon keeps Scotland in current state of lockdown as country records 77 new casesThe shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon, is calling on the government to publish the evidence behind its decision to add Croatia and other countries to its quarantine list.PA news agency has just posted its update on the the rolling seven-day rate of new cases of Covid-19 for every local authority area in England.The figures, for the seven days to August 17, are based on tests carried out in laboratories (pillar one of the Government’s testing programme) and in the wider community (pillar two).The rate is expressed as the number of new cases per 100,000 people. Data for the most recent three days (August 18-20) has been excluded as it is incomplete and likely to be revised.In Oldham 187 new cases were recorded in the seven days to August 17 - the equivalent of 78.9 per 100,000 people, down from 111.8 in the seven days to August 10.Northampton is almost level with Oldham on 78.4, up slightly from 74.4, with 176 new cases.Blackburn with Darwen is third, where the rate has fallen from 81.5 to 67.5, with 101 new cases.In Leicester the rate continues to fall, down from 70.3 to 52.5, with 186 new cases.Other areas recording notable week-on-week jumps include:- Manchester (up from 38.5 to 49.0, with 271 new cases)- Bury (up from 22.0 to 33.0, with 63 new cases)- Stoke-on-Trent (up from 15.6 to 26.1, with 67 new cases)Less than a third of people in England being tested for coronavirus in the wider population are receiving their results within 24 hours — despite Boris Johnson promising all results would be turned around within that timeframe two months ago.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the delays were due to an IT system failure at one of the laboratories which had delayed processing results and created a backlog.Johnson had pledged that, by the end of June, the results of all in-person tests would be back within 24 hours.He told the House of Commons on June 3 he would get “all tests turned around within 24 hours by the end of June, except for difficulties with postal tests or insuperable problems like that”.Much of the attention around Oldham’s infection rates have focused on the town’s Asian community.But a pub in the wealthy — and largely white - Uppermill area of Saddleworth has just been ordered to close by Oldham council for “continually” breaking lockdown regulations.A meat processing plant in Co Antrim is to temporarily close after 35 staff members tested positive for coronavirus.Cranswick Country Foods in Cullybackey, which processes pigs, will close from Saturday evening for a deep clean and to allow all staff members to be tested for Covid-19, the company has confirmed.In a statement Cranswick Country Foods said: “There has been a recent increase in the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Ballymena and the wider region and this has been acknowledged as a community issue.“As a result of this, we can confirm that a number of colleagues at our Ballymena site have tested positive for Covid-19. Working with the Public Health Authority (PHA), we have taken the decision to send all of our colleagues for testing.“If the test results are positive, the inidual will be required to self-isolate for 10 days if the test results are negative, the inidual will be required to self-isolate for 14 days.“Therefore, the site will need to temporarily suspend production.”Trade union Unite, which has members working at the Cranswick plant, said it was seeking urgent clarification from management regarding the extent of the cluster and the company’s plans to ensure the facility is safe when it re-opens. Unite is also seeking assurances that workers sent home to self-isolate will not suffer any loss of pay. Unite Regional Officer Liam Gallagher said: “The highly profitable meat processing sector relies on precarious, low-paid workers who may be reluctant to report symptoms or self-isolate because they fear a loss of pay.”Another 51 people in Northern Ireland have tested positive for the virus on Thursday according to the Department of Health.Some 298 people have tested positive for the virus in the last seven days, largely in the Mid and East Antrim area and Belfast.Following the tightening of restrictions in Northern Ireland this afternoon, the Police Service of Northern Ireland has arrested a man in his 40s over allegations of “malicious” comments being made on social media directed at Robin Swann, the regional health minister.Swann, the former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader, said in response: “I would rather people direct that frustration and anger at me as minister, than at the health service workers or those front-line workers.”But his successor as UUP leader, Steve Aiken, condemned the threats, saying:The vicious threats of violence made against Robin Swann are absolutely despicable. The torrent of abuse and lies which Robin has had to put with from some anonymous trolls and others who should know better has been abhorrent. Nobody should have to put up with that. It’s long before time that Twitter and other social media platforms lived up to their responsibilities.“This isn’t the first time that Robin has had threats of physical violence made against him, but it should be the last. He took on a job which no-one else wanted and he has committed long days and nights making difficult decisions, working with his colleagues in the Department of Health and the NHS, to protect the public during a global pandemic, the likes of which we haven’t faced in 100 years. He has been verbally attacked, threats of physical violence made against him and his family, and attempts made to undermine his good character.”The Daily Mirror’s associate editor, Kevin Maguire, is among many would-be holiday makers now cancelling their trips after Croatia and other countries were removed from the UK’s list of quarantine-free “travel corridors”.Lockdown restrictions could be tightened in Blackburn and Pendle in east Lancashire, Inzy Rashid at Sky News is reporting. Currently both areas are subject to “enhanced measures”, along with Greater Manchester and parts of West Yorkshire, which restrict gatherings in homes and gardens.Dominic Harrison, Blackburn’s director of public health, says about half of all confirmed cases of coronavirus locally are within the same households. Most infections are clustered in very small areas he said, heralding a “hyper-local approach” to tackling the outbreaks from now on.He writes in the Lancashire :Here someone, maybe a younger household member has become infected and may be asymptomatic. They will unknowingly pass it on to other household members and as an older member gets symptoms the whole family gets tested and find out they are all positive. A very large number of the remaining cases in the borough are clustered in very small areas, in a number of streets, statistically at a ‘lower super output area’- of about 1,500 people. Here it is clear that transmission must be occurring between family, friends and neighbours.Blackburn has around double the testing rates of the national average he said, but the figures remain concerning:So far, despite our best efforts, we still have amongst the highest rates of transmission in the country. We had our highest rate of cases per 100,000 of the population in the week ending August 12 We have had a Covid confirmed case rate of 94.7 per 100,000 of the population – which represents 141 cases per week. Our testing rates are still about double the national average at 210 per 100,000 and our positivity rate is at 6.5 per cent. This is also the highest it has been in recent weeks.If we are going to avoid a full lockdown by central government we now need to be even more prescriptive on what can and can’t be done, to target the behaviours we know risk passing on the virus and to move to a stricter enforcement approach to breaches of the guidance.The approach we take from now on is going to have to be even more targeted on hyper-local areas of highest transmission.”Shapps said the decision to change the travel corridors took a range of factors into account, including:Shapps said Portugal has now been added to the list of travel corridors, meaning that travellers from there will no longer have to quarantine for 14 days.Croatia, Austria and Trinidad \u0026amp Tobago will be removed from the UK’s list of travel corridors, the transport secretary Grant Shapps has said.That means anyone returning from those countries will have to quarantine for 14 days if they return after 4am on Saturday.The Belfast  has more details on the tightening of restrictions in Northern Ireland.It reports the Northern Irish health secretary, Robin Swann, talking of a “significant and difficult” outbreak at a meat-processing plant in Co Antrim, after 35 new cases emerged from within staff, some infecting friends and family.“All workers in the factory now have to self-isolate,” he said, adding that the plant will be closed to allow for deep cleaning and the testing of staff. “I am becoming concerned with the increase in community transmission,” he said. “There will be no further relaxations of any other measures.Swann said the R rate in Northern Ireland is currently 1.3 and is “definitely” above 1, the newspaper reported.The UK government said 41,403 people had died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of 5pm on Wednesday, an increase of six on the day before.Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies show there have now been 57,000 deaths registered in the UK where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate.The government also said that as of 9am on Thursday, there had been a further 1,182 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus. Overall, 322,280 cases have been confirmed.Lockdown restrictions are being tightened in Northern Ireland after 51 new coronavirus infections were reported overnight.

File photograph: iStockMany schoolbuses are likely to operate without social distancing when schools reopen, despite new public health advice which states that secondary students should maintain a safe distance while on board such vehicles.The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) advised the Government earlier this week that secondary students should both maintain physical distancing and wear face coverings while on schoolbuses, in line with wider rules on public transport. This was a change to earlier advice which stated that physical distancing was not required.The updated advice says primary school students should physically distance “where possible” on buses, but do not need to wear face coverings.In a statement on Thursday, the Department of Education said there will be a “rolling implementation” of these new guidelines to provide for physical distancing on secondary school bus services.It is understood that hundreds of additional buses will now be needed to transport some 68,000 secondary students to school each day in compliance with the new guidelines .Safe operationA spokesman for the Department of Education said discussions were underway with Bus Éireann - which operates school transport services - so that any services that can operate from the start of the school year at 50 per cent capacity will do so.He said other post-primary transport services will be re-organised and additional services will be provided as required to allow for physical distancing “over the coming period”. In the meantime, he said a range of measures will be in place to ensure the safe operation of school transport services. They include preassigned seating to ensure children sit beside siblings or classmates, additional hygiene and cleaning measures on board schoolbuses and the wearing of face coverings for children over the age of 13. He said the department welcomed NPHET advice and arrangements for primary school transport schemes. These services will operate fully when schools reopen, with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place. Secondary school services will also commence operation when schools reopen, with additional measures and hygiene requirements in place, and with the “rolling implementation of measures to provide physical distancing on the post-primary services as required”.Additional resourcesThe spokesman said the Minister for Education will continue to work with other Government Ministers to identify and consider the additional resources required to support the rollout of these measures. Bus Éireann said in a statement that it is implementing a range of measures to ensure the safe operation of its school transport service when schools reopen.It said the Department of Education and Bus Éireann will continue to communicate with parents, s, contractors and drivers on the operation of services for the upcoming school year.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Activist says ongoing denial about scale of crisis contrasts with urgency of Covid fightEvaluation suggests using ecosystem thresholds to develop policies is not best approach\u0026lsquoExtensive Irish commitment to data centres\u0026rsquo could cause cost to consumer, study finds"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 target"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsActing chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn has acknowledged that “ many people are confused” about what they should and should not be doing in light of the new restrictions announced earlier this week.“Please limit the number of people that you are meeting up with over the next three weeks. Please do not have more than six people over to your house or garden. Outside no more than 15 people should meet up and even then, people need to be physically distance from one another.”He added: “You can still play sport, you can still go to a restaurant and meet your friends and family but we are asking that you do this in as safe away as possible.”Dr Glynn said the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) made these recommendations in light of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the communityHe said that outbreaks in workplaces and direct provision centres were “just part of the story”.Public health doctors were particularly concerned about the number of close contacts as a result of “socialising around sporting activity, house activities... social engagements and car sharing”, he said.On Thursday, Taoiseach Micheál rejected the claim that there was mixed messaging emerging from the Government and public health experts.NPHET is meeting on Thursday discuss the possible lifting of the restrictions on the three midland counties which were introduced earlier this month.Sources said the increase in cases appears to have been controlled in Laois and Offaly, but the figures in Kildare remained worryingly high.‘Managing risk’Speaking on Wednesday night, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly acknowledged that parents were worried about sending their children back to school in the coming weeks but added that the coronavirus situation was now about managing risk.“We manage risk in our lives everytime we get into a car. Driving a car is an inherently risking thing to do. So we have seatbelts, we have rules of the road and we have all of these things,” he told Virgin Media News.“Playing sports is an inherently risky thing to do, our children being on trampolines is an inherently risky thing for them to be doing.”“This is about recognising that there are things we do in life that carry a risk and we’ve got to manage that risk and unfortunately until we’ve got a vaccine widely distributed for covid-19, that is the case,” he added.“That’s what the measures are about. Let’s not wait until community transmission to go up, let’s move now to do what we know will work to reduce community transmission so that the schools can reopen.”On Thursday, Northern Ireland reported 51 new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of people who have tested positive for the virus in the North to 6,556.The daily total compares to 34 new cases reported on Wednesday, and 41 on Tuesday.No further fatalities were reported, and the total number of coronavirus-related deaths recorded by the North’s department of health remains at 559.Meanwhile, key employers in the tourism sector have called on the Government to consult it before publishing the next iteration of the roadmap for reopening Ireland.In response to the Government decision to publish a new “ Roadmap for Resilience and Recovery”, by September 13th, the Irish Hotels Federation said “people must have livelihoods”.The sector which was disappointed by the latest restrictions on social gatherings said public health should go hand-in-hand with ensuring a viable economy when the pandemic had passed.Tourism was the State’s biggest employer pre-Covid, supporting almost 270,000 jobs, said hotels federation president Elaina Fitzgerald Kane.However latest figures for the hotel and guesthouse sector show that occupancy levels reached just 42 per cent for July and 49 per cent so far in August, the peak months for tourism. This compares to an average of 90 percent last year.Average occupancy levels of 23 per cent for September and 17 per cent for October are now being reported by the industry, based on current bookings.Ms Fitzgerald Kane said “businesses require greater certainty so they can plan forward.“ What is necessary is an active, intensive and sustained public policy support framework to steer the tourism and hospitality industry through the crisis.”Ms Fitzgerald Kane said the sector should be consulted on the Government’s forthcoming strategy which she said must include a comprehensive testing, tracing and monitoring regime."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335086.1597942796!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"three days for a test one man s delay to get checked for covid 19","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJohn: ‘It is no wonder there are reports of people not bothering to test.’ File photograph: GettyJohn from south Co Dublin (not his real name) started feeling unwell earlier this week.

An estimated 40,000 homes and businesses are without power across the county as a result.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStorm Ellen has caused widespread flooding, including at Timoleague, west Cork (above), and cut power to thousands of homes and businesses. Photograph: Andy Gibson.There are 70,000 homes, businesses and farms without power after Storm Ellen swept over Ireland overnight and left a trail of destruction in its wake.According to the ESB’s Power Check website, there were scores of faults across the country on Thursday, with counties Cork, Tipperary, Westmeath, Longford and Limerick worst affected.In an update on the situation on Thursday afternoon, the ESB warned that some homes will remain without electricity tonight, predominantly in Cork and Tipperary.“We are advising all those impacted by outages that they should prepare to be without electricity overnight and into tomorrow, with small pockets of customers potentially without power beyond that. It is very important that any customers who use electrically powered medical devices should contact their healthcare professional to make alternative arrangements if necessary,” it said.Earlier this morning, 194,000 properties were without power, but ESB Networks said this had been reduced to 70,000 by the afternoon.A full list of the faults can be found on the Power Check website.ESB Networks had said earlier it is advising customers impacted by outages that they should “prepare to be without electricity for a number of days”.Repair crews were being deployed this morning in the most affected areas and where safe to do so, “assessing the damage so that they can restore power as quickly and effectively as possible”, it said.Derek Hynes, operations manager for ESB Networks, said the earlier figure of 194,000 impacted properties had not been the largest figure ever for damage.He told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland on Thursday that the highest number without power ever was in 2017 following Storm Ophelia, when there were 385,000 impacted properties, followed by Storm Darwin in 2014 when there were 280,000 without power.However, this is the first time there has been such loss of power at this time of year, and the impact will be different because trees are in full leaf, he explained.Met Éireann also said that the storm had broken the mean wind speed record for August.WarningMet Éireann on Thursday morning issued a status yellow wind warning for counties Dublin, Louth, Wexford, Wicklow, Meath, Cork, Kerry and Waterford. The warning was valid between 5pm on Thursday and 5am on Friday.A status yellow rainfall warning was also issued for the entire country for Thursday and Thursday night, valid between 9am on Thursday and 5am on Friday.The forecaster reported that Thursday night would be windy, with widespread showers and thunderstorms giving a continued risk of flooding. Winds would be up to gale force in coastal areas, it added.In Co Cork, flooding was reported in Skibbereen, Kinsale, Midleton and Bantry after Storm Ellen hit.Met Éireann had issued a status red storm warning for Cork, with winds predicted to hit in excess of 150kmh, between 9pm and midnight on Wednesday. The alert proved accurate, with high winds bringing down trees and power lines all over Munster.Cork was particularly badly hit as winds, measured at one stage as gusting at 143kmh at Roches Point at the mouth of Cork Harbour, brought down power lines all over the county.Jim Molloy, acting director of services and roads with Cork County Council, on Thursday said the local authority had responded to 50 callouts overnight for fallen trees in east Cork and 30 in relation to flooding, mostly in Skibbereen.It had been “very tempestuous” last night, he said, with the storm causing “a lot of chaos”.Major routes have been cleared, but he advised motorists to exercise extreme caution and to be alert for fallen trees and spot flooding.In a statement on Thursday, Cork City Council said there was a significant risk of flooding in low-lying areas of the city centre from 7.30pm amid high spring tides.The council said it has a limited stock of gel bags and sandbags available for collection by members of the public and businesses.Badly hitAmong the areas badly hit by Storm Ellen were Fermoy where more than 1,800 homes were affected by power outages Macroom where almost 1,500 premises were affected Cloyne in east Cork where almost 2,000 customers were affected and Riverstown near Glanmire where more than 1,000 customers were affected.In Cork city, Douglas was particularly badly hit, with almost 2,500 customers affected, while more than 400 customers in Bishopstown were left without power and 700 homes around Carrigaline in south Co Cork were also affected. There were smaller outages in Kilworth, Rathcormac and Whitechurch.More than 250 customers near Youghal were left without power, while in Tallow in Co Waterford more than 500 customers were affected. Near Dungarvan, 1,200 customers were impacted, along with 300 customers near Waterford city, as high winds wreaked havoc.While Cork bore the brunt of the high winds, there are also power outages in Co Tipperary, with 1,100 homes and businesses in Clonmel being left without electricity. The north of the county was also hit, with more than 900 customers affected in Templemore and more than 800 in Toomevara.More than 2,000 customers were affected around Ballyhale in Co Kilkenny and more than 1,600 near Tullamore in Co Offaly. In Athy, Co Kildare, 400 customers were affected, while there were smaller outages in Bagenalstown in Co Carlow, Clonroche in Co Wexford Ballybunion in Co Kerry and Athenry, Co Galway.By Thursday evening local authorities in the south and west were reporting they were still responding to debris and fallen trees following the storm.Galway County Council reported that the L3111 was closed as there were four trees down on the road.FloodingStorm Ellen brought with it heavy rains and Skibbereen in west Cork in particular was badly affected by the downpours, with Bridge Street flooding to a depth of several inches before members of the Skibbereen unit of the Cork County Fire Service, backed up by Cork West Civil Defence, cleared the street.Local Cork South-West TDs Holly Cairns of the Social Democrats and Christopher O’Sullivan of Fianna Fáil both posted footage on their Twitter accounts of the flooding in Skibbereen, with flood waters racing down Bridge Street in the centre of town.Mr O’Sullivan tweeted: “This shouldn’t be happening in Skibbereen. Millions spent on flood protection – the entire town should be dry even in this intense rainfall . . . The flood committee flagged that this area needed more protection. OPW need to provide answers.”Cork County engineer Kevin Morey told RTÉ Radio 1’s News at One that the flood relief scheme in the town was designed to protect against river flooding, and the flooding amid Storm Ellen was a result of the overwhelming of a drain system.An Post tweeted that it was experiencing some disruption to its services, particularly in the west and southwest, following the storm.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4242687.1597871416!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government resists calls from nphet for a return to full lockdown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIt is understood that leaders of the three Government parties and other senior figures discussed the prospect of returning to lockdown over the weekend but agreed that this could not happen, and made this clear to public health experts. Public health experts have privately warned the Government that the country may have to return to a full lockdown if the increase in Covid-19 cases continues.But there is strong resistance to any return to lockdown in Government with senior figures believing it would be impossible to manage.Several senior sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have confirmed to The  that the prospect of return to a full lockdown has been mooted during informal discussions in recent days. However, Government figures have made clear that they do not believe this option can be taken for social and economic reasons.It is understood that leaders of the three Government parties and other senior figures discussed the prospect of returning to lockdown over the weekend but agreed that this could not happen, and made this clear to public health experts. The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) did not recommend a return to full lockdown in its advice to Government on Monday.However, senior sources say that the question of reimposing the lockdown is likely to resurface if the numbers of new cases continues to mount, as health experts fear they will.But political resistance to any return to lockdown remains strong. “They were talking about it but it won’t happen,” said another person familiar with the discussions.Last night the Department of Health said there had been an additional two deaths and 54 cases of Covid notified. Two-thirds of the new cases were among people who are under 45 years old. This brings the total number of Covid-19 related fatalities to 1,775, and to 27,547 the total number of confirmed cases to date. The increase in 54 cases follows 190 additional cases reported on Tuesday.Kildare figuresThe State’s public health team will on Thursday discuss the possible lifting of the restrictions on the three midland counties which were introduced earlier this month. Sources said the increase in cases appears to have been controlled in Laois and Offaly, but the figures in Kildare remained worryingly high.Meanwhile, the Government has deferred changes to the so-called “green list” of destinations for foreign travel which were expected this week amid increasing Covid-19 infection rates internationally.Cabinet sources say that Ministers were due to remove Greece from the list but have now decided to defer all planned changes pending further advice from the State’s public health team about the feasibility of the list.One senior source said the decision to defer changes to the list was also driven by fears that it would present a confusing message to the public.The 14-day cumulative cases per 100,000 of population in Ireland is now 26 and many European countries are experiencing a similar surge.For countries on the list normal precautions apply to travel there, with no period of restricted movement expected for those arriving into the State from the destinations.Travel restrictionsThe Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly is preparing proposals on restricting non-essential travel from countries with high levels of coronavirus infections. NPHET has called for this measure to be introduced on at least two occasions.Meanwhile, an independent expert panel on the impact of Covid-19 on the nursing home sector has recommended extra funding be pumped into the State’s Fair Deal scheme, but called for greater financial transparency from private sector homes.The report states that “in the panel’s view, additional funding will be required”. It notes that “in the absence of published financial accounts”, contributions from private providers are “unknown”, but says that “investment will be required to ensure nursing home adherence to Hiqa’s nursing home standards and further ongoing costs arising from Covid-19”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Report by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirusStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Saudi minister says \u0026lsquopeace must be achieved\u0026rsquo on the basis of international agreementsOne found guilty, three acquitted in UN-backed tribunal into killing of former Lebanese PMCourt rules there is no proof Syria was involved in Hariri\u0026rsquos assassinationFour low-ranking members of the Shia Muslim Hezbollah political party are accused of killing the former prime minister and 21 others in a massive bombing in 2005Two countries taking steps towards normal relations with telephone links and flightsPutin suggestion came after Trump said he would trigger a \u0026lsquosnapback\u0026rsquo of sanctionsAs inquiry into Beirut blast gets under way, rescue of country not ruling class urgedThursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332116.1597668041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inside joe biden s race of a lifetime to be us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"britain must stand us against iranian tyranny","story":"There are moments in history when the Special Relationship really matters. The Falklands War, the Gulf War, the response to the 911 attacks on New York and Washington, the NATO-led operation against the Taliban and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan are prime examples. The world is a better and safer place when the United States and the United Kingdom stand together on the world stage, especially when confronting dangerous adversaries such as the increasingly aggressive and menacing tyranny in Tehran.The Iranian regime has the blood of American and British servicemen in Iraq on its hands. It threatens to wipe Israel off the “global political map”, continues to harbor ambitions to be a nuclear weapons power, and arms and funds terror groups across the Middle East. It has even plotted a series of terror attacks on European soil in recent years.Iran is also a dictatorship that brutalises its own people, and tramples upon the very principles the United Nations is founded upon. This country simply cannot be allowed to become an even greater threat to international security.Today, America’s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo heads to the United Nations Security Council, where he is expected to announce that the United States will invoke “snapback sanctions” against Iran, following the refusal of the Security Council last week to extend the UN arms embargo which has been in place since 2007.With the lifting of the embargo in October, the world’s biggest state sponsor of terror will be free to purchase deadly weaponry from across the world, which it will undoubtedly deploy in Syria and Yemen, as well as use to arm terrorist groups such as Hamas and Hizbollah. In the words of US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft, the UN vote will “unlock Iran’s access to combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships, tanks, missile systems, and other advanced weapons.”The snapback sanctions, which the US can impose through United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231, will prevent that from happening. Even though the US formally withdrew from the failed Iran nuclear deal in 2018 (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), it can still execute the snapback process in accordance with the provisions of Resolution 2231, which endorsed the Iran deal back in 2015. As Richard Goldberg, the former Director for Countering Iranian Weapons of Mass Destruction at the White House National Security Council has noted, the Trump Administration has every right to invoke the snapback option:“The United States is defined forever as a “JCPOA participant” in a binding Security Council resolution for the purpose of snapback. Whether the resolution was drafted this way intentionally or not makes no difference. Whether the administration of former President Barack Obama carefully negotiated the wording of UNSCR 2231 to protect a U.S. snapback right in perpetuity, or the Trump administration took advantage of a glaring oversight, the outcome is the same. The resolution, a document legally independent of the Iran deal itself, gives the United States the right to trigger the snapback if Iran breaches its commitments.”It is time for the United Kingdom to step up to the plate at the United Nations and stand with the United States. The UK abstained in last week’s vote along with Germany and France, refusing to confront the Chinese and Russians, who voted to end the arms embargo against Tehran. It is time for Great Britain to truly break free of the ghost of the European Union’s weak and ineffective Common Foreign and Security Policy.In the Brexit era, Britain should not feel obligated to side with Brussels, whose instincts on Iran and so many other issues including dealing with China, are forged in an appeasement mentality, one that is driven in some quarters by both financial interests and anti-Americanism.Together with the United States, Brexit Britain must be a standard bearer for freedom and a powerful opponent for the likes of Iran, China and Russia. It is hugely disappointing that the UK opted not to vote in support of maintaining an arms embargo against one of the deadliest dictatorships in the world, one that has brutally taken British lives, and talks of genocide against the people of Israel.In the battle between good and evil, there can be no middle ground. Iran’s rulers thrive off isions in the West, and the desire on the part of some European capitals to continue to do business with one of the worst human rights violators in the world.Today, Britain faces a choice at the UN. Work with its closest friend and ally the United States to hold Iran to account, or join the European appeasement lobby that strengthens the position of Tehran’s friends in Moscow and Beijing. This is a major leadership moment for Boris Johnson, who holds a deep distrust of Iran’s intentions, and wants to ensure that Iran’s ambitions are constrained. It is impossible to imagine the Prime Minister’s heroes, Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill, walking away from the United States in a similar situation.As history has shown on so many occasions, the Special Relationship is fundamentally important to British interests, and is even more invaluable to the UK outside of the EU. On several fronts, the partnership between London and Washington is being strengthened, with a large-scale US-UK free trade deal now on the horizon, and the US and British governments working closely to confront the growing challenge posed by China from Hong Kong to the South China Sea.Great Britain and the United States should be standing shoulder to shoulder against the Iranian threat at every opportunity. Today is one of those key times to do so.Nile Gardiner is the Director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at The Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gcse results day 2020 gcse results day exams grades students","story":"More than a quarter of GCSEs were awarded top grades today, up from around a fifth last year as students across the country collected their results.Of the GCSEs handed to 16-year-olds in England 27.5 per cent were marked at 7 or above, equivalent to A or A*, compared with 21.8 per cent last year, as shown in the table below.Almost four fifths (78.8 per cent) of results were handed pass marks, up from 69.9 per cent in 2019.Over 950,000 students in England received their teachers’ predicted grades on Thursday - known as centre assessed grades or CAGs – rather than those calculated by an algorithm, after an about-turn by ministers earlier this week.Education chiefs have warned that sixth forms may have to introduce aptitude tests to weed out weaker students in the wake of GCSE grade inflation.The higher than average proportion of students achieving top grades means that more pupils will be eligible to study difficult subjects at A-levels that would normally be out of their reach.On Wednesday night it emerged that close to half a million pupils face fresh exam chaos after an 11th hour decision to withhold their results. The exam board Pearson told schools not to publish BTEC results, saying they needed more time to recalculate the grades.The development will heap further pressure on the education secretary, who was accused of “forgetting” about the 450,000 students who take vocational qualifications.Teachers are braced for a GCSE backlash as school leaders say that their predicted grades were never meant to be given to pupils.Students picking up their A-level results last week were left distraught after close to 40 per cent were downgraded from teachers’ recommended grades.But teachers fear that while A-level students blamed the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation’s (Ofqual) statistical model for their grades, GCSE students will blame them.Schools have urged parents and pupils not to take out their frustration on teachers if they are disappointed with their results.In every subject assessed, the proportion of entries achieving at least a 7 grade - the equivalent of an A grade under the old system - has risen on last year amid the marking chaos.Subjects with smaller cohorts, including those with fewer than 10,000 entries, saw the most significant rises.Performing and expressive arts saw a rise of 15.1 percentage points  on last year, with 38.5 per cent of all entries achieving a pass mark from only 2,500 entries. Among engineering students, the top grades also rose by 15.1 percentage points to 26.4 per cent achieving at least a 7.The best performing subjects included classical subjects, where almost three-quarters of entries achieved at least a 7 grade. They include Classical Greek, Ancient History and Latin.At the other end of the scale some of the core subjects, including English and Maths, saw the lowest proportion of students achieving the top grades.Just over one in ten entries to double science achieved at least a 7 grade, rising to just under one in five for English and Maths.The number of GCSE entries for Spanish hit an all-time high in 2020, with more than 100,000 entries in England for the first time since at least 2011.French remains the most popular language at GCSE, with 124,000 entries this year - a one per cent rise on 2019.But the numbers taking Spanish rose by seven per cent, while interest in German and other modern languages such as Italian, Greek, Arabic and Chinese all wane.The numbers taking other modern languages fell by 28 per cent on last year, with just over 22,000 entrants, and those taking German fell by 1.3 per cent to just over 40,000.The number of entries sitting citizenship studies has risen to an all-time high, with the largest year-on-year rise in numbers sitting. 21,902 entries were assessed in the subject, up from 19,701 last year and the highest number since at least 2011Biology remains the most popular science subject with 165,000 entries, but the numbers sitting have fallen in all sciences except double science.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"kim jong un calls rare congress north koreas ruling party","story":"Kim Jong-un has made a frank admission that North Korea’s economic progress has been “seriously delayed,” in the latest indication that his authoritarian state is struggling to cope with the triple whammy of international sanctions, the coronavirus pandemic and severe flooding.The North Korean leader acknowledged the hardships faced by his population on Wednesday during the first meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea’s central body in eight months, stating that the country “faced unexpected and inevitable challenges in various aspects”.He pledged to unveil a new five-year economic development plan by this coming January at a rare Workers’ Party congress, state media reported.“Planned attainment of the goals for improving the national economy have been seriously delayed and the people’s living standard had not been improved remarkably,” he said in an unusually candid admission from a leader who normally trades on the infallibility of his family’s dynastical rule.The new economic blueprint would examine the “deviations and shortcomings” of the current plan, which had fallen short of its objectives due to internal and external circumstances, reported the Korean Central News Agency.The current five-year plan was unveiled at a party congress held in May 2016, the first since Kim took the reigns of power in 2011, and it was supposed to achieve its economic prosperity goals by the end of this year.State media made no mention this week of the tough economic sanctions imposed to curb the country’s nuclear and long-range missile programmes but Pyongyang has repeatedly slammed the international policy in the past.In an interview with the  in 2018, Ri Gi Song, one of the country’s leading economists, hinted at the regime’s frustration that the financial penalties were holding the economy back.“Frankly, if there were no sanctions our development pace would be much faster than now,” he said.A diplomatic détente that saw Kim hold several unprecedented nuclear negotiations with Donald Trump, the US president, has since collapsed, crushing any hopes that sanctions may be lifted any time soon.This year Kim has faced multiple other difficulties on a domestic front, including a reported health scare that saw him disappear from the public eye for weeks.The pandemic has compounded the economic crisis by cutting off remaining minimal opportunities for trade as Pyongyang locked down the borders to prevent the virus from decimating the country’s ailing health system.Torrential rains this summer have also wiped out farmland, increasing food insecurity for the impoverished population, of which 40 per cent already suffer from malnutrition, according to the United Nations World Food Programme.Kim’s statement this week was the latest sign of the dire situation faced by his regime. In recent months he has publicly lashed out at officials over lax virus management and for allegedly “careless” spending in the construction of a showcase general hospital in Pyongyang.The outbursts have led to speculation that he could be preparing for a shake-up of the ruling politburo.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed 2020 gcse a level grades inflated teacher assessments","story":"Grades for GCSEs and A-levels have hit record highs this year with the switch to teacher predictions, but not all subjects have reaped the benefits to the same extent. GCSE subjects with smaller entries including Astronomy, Performing and Expressive Arts, Engineering and Drama have seen teachers predict relatively more top grades this year than those with larger cohorts, such as Maths and English, after the government ditched the use of an algorithm to assign results. The share of grades achieved by GCSE students of all ages that were at least grade 7 - equivalent to an A or higher before recent reforms - has increased from a fifth (20.7 per cent) to a quarter (25.9 per cent), the highest since 2002, and not a single subject saw a decrease in its pass rate year-on-year.Over 9 in 10 subjects (90.6 per cent) have seen their biggest share ever of top marks, while 96.9 per cent have seen their biggest rise in top marks year-on-year. However, some subjects, particularly those with a lower number of students sitting exams, saw much bigger gains year-on-year than average.Other Sciences, which includes subjects like Astronomy and Geology, saw the share of top grades increase by 17 percentage points (pp) this year - the most of any subject - while Performing and Expressive Arts and Engineering both saw rises of 15.1pp this year. Among Performing and Expressive Arts 38.5 per cent of all entries achieved a pass mark from only 2,500 entries. Among the fewer than 3,000 Engineering students, the top grades also rose by 15.1 percentage points to 26.4 per cent achieving at least a 7.Other big gains included Economics, Music and Drama, with rises of 15.0pp, 14.2pp and 13.3pp respectively.Indeed the top ten subjects for inflation in top grades had an average of 44,374 students entering exams in England, in contrast to the bottom ten, which has an average of 305,350 students entering. In particular, top grades in English and Maths - compulsory for all GCSE students - saw relatively smaller rises, with 4.8pp and 3.1pp respectively.Aside from GCSE results, Ofqual has also released retrospective data for A-levels results day last Thursday, which had seen students open results letters containing grades set by the exam regulator\u0027s algorithm before the government\u0027s U-turn on Monday.The model, which moderated teacher submitted grades using a combination of historic inidual and school achievement, came under fire after it became clear it had downgraded just under 40 per cent of teacher predictions for students.However, comparing those original grades with today\u0027s data, which have been determined by either predictions or the algorithm\u0027s grade depending on which is higher, reveals that History, English Literature and Biology were the three subjects hit hardest by downgrades.The algorithm lowered the share of A and above grades at A-level for History down from 36.7 per cent to 24.1 per cent - a drop of 12.6pp, while English Literature saw top marks downgraded from 37.7 per cent to 25.4 per cent.In contrast subjects such as German, Music and Design Technology came out relatively unscathed by the algorithm, seeing downgrades of 4.6pp, 5.6pp and 6.0pp respectively. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"young people feel invincible ignoring coronavirus rules chief","story":"Young people are starting to believe they are invincible in the face of coronavirus and are no longer following the rules, a leading World Health Organisation (WHO) official has suggested.Dr Hans Kluge, the organisation\u0027s regional Director for Europe, said on Thursday he was very concerned that under-24s are regularly appearing among new cases.His comments came as infection rates continued to rise sharply across much of the continent, and followed widespread reports of partying youngsters ignoring social distancing after months of lockdown.France, Germany and Italy all saw their biggest daily rise in cases since the spring this week, while Spain is in the grip of a major outbreak with 3,715 new cases on Wednesday alone.Young people are at the forefront of the Covid-19 response and they have a very powerful message to convey through their behaviour and their communication, said Dr Kluge.Low risk does not mean no risk – no one is invincible, and if you do not die from Covid it may stick to your body like a tornado with a long tail. While young people are less likely to die than older people (see graphic below), they can still be very seriously affected. This virus affects organs throughout the body.The proportion of those aged from 15 to 24 who are infected in Europe has risen three-fold in the last five months from around 4.5 per cent to 15 per cent, WHO data shows.Dr Kluge\u0027s remarks came as a new study suggested children may carry significantly more coronavirus in their system than previously thought.In a study in Massachusetts hospitals, infected children were shown to have a higher level of virus in their airways than hospitalised adults in ICUs for Covid-19 treatment, researchers said.They examined 192 paediatric patients aged from 0 to 22 years, and 49 children tested positive for coronavirus while an additional 18 had late-onset, Covid-19-related illness.Lael Yonker, the director of the MGH Cystic Fibrosis Centre, and lead author of the study, said: I was surprised by the high levels of virus we found in children of all ages, especially in the first two days of infection.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/25/15/the-next-step.jpg","title":"cbbc first day episodes trailer hannah actor australia","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Channel was recently praised for broadcasting same-sex kiss on ‘The Next Step’CBBC has been praised for airing a groundbreaking TV series about a transgender school girl.The opening episode of Australian series First Day was broadcast on the children’s channel on Wednesday (19 August).The drama follows 12-year-old Hannah Bradford (Evie MacDonald), a transgender girl, as she heads to high school for the first time.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe four-episode miniseries first aired in Australia in March, making MacDonald the first trans actor to play the lead role in a scripted TV drama in the country’s history.In the First Day trailer, Hannah is seen preparing to join a new school and dealing with the pressures of being bullied and deadnamed. CBBC was widely praised for its decision to air the show, with Pride in London tweeting: “Today @cbbc aired the 1st episode of award-winning miniseries First Day, which follows transgender pupil Hannah as she starts a new year at school. Brilliant to have such important representation for trans kids on our screens!”Why all the fuss over a same-sex kiss on CBBC?One viewer wrote: “I am watching First Day with my 7yr old daughter. It is absolutely fantastic. I am so pleased that this programme is on as its so important to support transgender kids and help others to kindly understand. Well done. It’s brilliant.”Last month, the channel, whose primary audience are aged six to 13, also received praise for airing a historical same-sex kiss on dance mockumentary The Next Step.When the scene prompted some complaints, the BBC stood by the decision, stating: “CBBC regularly portrays heterosexual young people dating, falling in love, and kissing, and it is an important way of showing children what respectful, kind and loving relationships look like.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Prolonged lockdowns, mass unemployment and disrupted international trade caused stock markets to crash and dire forecasts for the future.It will take years for the full impact of Covid-19 to be realised, with UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres warning in April that it would trigger a recession “that probably has no parallel in the recent past.”Yet amid all the chaos, certain “safe-haven assets” have bucked market trends to reach new yearly highs in recent days.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince mid-March, when the first wave of lockdowns began around the world, the price of gold has risen by nearly a third. In that same time period, bitcoin has nearly trebled in value and continues to climb.During times of global economic certainty, investors typically look to secure their holdings in gold, silver and other non-volatile assets.Bitcoin may have been created in response to the 20078 Financial Crisis, but its price volatility has made it a notoriously risky investment.Its recent price gains have led some to suggest that bitcoin has moved from a speculative asset to a safe-haven asset, with some even describing it as “digital gold”.The cryptocurrency’s finite supply – no more than 21 million bitcoins will ever exist – and lack of ties to any country or institution has helped fortify these parallels with gold and may be why investors are increasingly seeing it as an effective store of value.Since starting the year trading at around $7,000, bitcoin saw steady gains before mirroring global markets in March by crashing to below $5,000. In the following five months, bitcoin\u0027s gains have outstripped any other major asset and risen four-times faster than the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Visualising billionaire’s wealth gains during the pandemic“Bitcoin is currently realising its reputation as a form of digital gold,  Nigel Green, CEO of finance firm deVere Group, told The Independent.Up to now, gold has been known as the ultimate safe-haven asset, but bitcoin – which shares its key characteristics of being a store of value and scarcity – could potentially knock gold from its long-held position in the future as the world becomes ever-more tech-driven.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

director for Europe ‘very concerned’ younger age groups regularly appearing among new recorded casesCoronavirus may stick to young people “like a tornado with a long tail,” the World Health Organisation has warned, amid growing evidence that younger generations are driving spikes in infections across Europe.Dr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, told a press briefing he is “very concerned” that younger age groups are regularly appearing among new cases recorded on the continent.“Young people are at the forefront of the Covid-19 response and they have a very powerful message to convey through their behaviour and their communication,” he said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Low risk does not mean no risk, no one is invincible and if you do not die from Covid it may stick to your body like a tornado with a long tail.“While young people are less likely to die than older people they can still be very seriously affected, this virus affects organs throughout the body.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyIn England, the most recent data from Public Health England shows that the 15-44 age group currently has the highest rate of infection of any other group – excluding those over 85.A recent pre-print study from Imperial College London also found that of some 120,000 swabs taken from people in England in May, the highest levels of infection were recorded among those aged 18-24.Similar developments have been reported in Luxembourg and Croatia, where incidence in young groups is clearly rising. There have also been slight increases in the infection rate among young people in Austria, Denmark, Slovakia, Spain and Estonia.On the basis of these trends, experts have warned that a second wave could target younger generations.The first wave of Covid-19 has predominantly affected elderly people, those with underlying health conditions and ethnic minority groups.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it could help reveal where the Milky Way is heading, they said.Scientists have been examining the wind from the centre of the galaxy over the last decade. One of the great breakthroughs came when they discovered the Fermi Bubbles, which are two giant orbs made up of hot gas and cosmic rays.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the new discovery indicates there is also cold and very dense gas being shot out from the centre of the galaxy too. Since the cold gas is heavier, it is more difficult to move across the Milky Way.As it pushes the gas out across the Milky Way, our galaxy could find itself without the resources it needs to go on forming stars, the researchers said.Our Milky Way galaxy is surrounded by a hot halo, scientists sayGalaxies can be really good at shooting themselves in the foot, Naomi McClure-Griffiths from The Australian National University, one of the researchers on the study, said.When you drive out a lot of mass, you\u0027re losing some of the material that could be used to form stars, and if you lose enough of it, the galaxy can\u0027t form stars at all anymore.So, to be able to see hints of the Milky Way losing this star forming gas is kind of exciting - it makes you wonder what\u0027s going to happen next!There is a massive black hole at the middle of our galaxy, known as Sagittarius A*. That could be responsible for shooting the gas out across the galaxy, or it could have been blown by the vast stars that are also nearby.We don\u0027t know how either the black hole or the star formation can produce this phenomenon.

I have my own choices, I have my own point of view. All of those things, which seem small, they make a huge difference in the way a character comes off the screen.”Throughout the show’s six seasons, Ross ensured that whenever her character was seen completing domestic chores they were done to “match the experience of the scene”.We’re Here stars on Drag Race, fame and trans representationMaisie Williams breaks silence on controversial Game of Thrones endingBetter Call Saul’s final season will change how you see Breaking BadThe 47-year-old clarified, “I don’t believe they’re ‘lady chores’. I think they’re house chores. And I don’t believe that we should assume, because I believe every relationship is a negotiation between two people about what each of them feel comfortable doing.“I think the more that we portray that on television, the more that becomes the reality out in the world, or matches the reality that the world actually is.”Ross won a Golden Globe award in 2017 for her performance in the acclaimed comedy series. She plays Rainbow “Bow” Johnson, a mother and doctor married to Dre Johnson, played by Anderson.The actor was recently nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. This latest nod marks the fourth consecutive year that Ross has been nominated for her performance in Black-ish.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

The UK has a moral responsibility to protect refugeesRefugee status should not equate with destitutionMore than 500 people evicted from Calais refugee campThe European Commission declined to comment on the situation in talks when approached by The Independent, which it said were ongoing, but an official reiterated that the UK would lead the Dublin regulation when the transition period ends at the end of 2020.EU officials also stressed that Mr Barnier\u0027s negotiating mandate does not cover asylum matters.The EU has long sought to reform the Dublin regulation, which is widely seen as unfair on countries like Greece and Italy where people crossing the Mediterranean tend to land first, as a matter of geography. Political deadlock on the issue at EU level means the regulations remain in place for now, but EU member states are understood to see Brexit as an opportunity to encourage the UK to take its fair share of people fleeing conflict disaster.The Dublin regulations do not restrict where a person can actually claim asylum or make their attempt illegal – rather they determine the country that will ultimately process them.

It is illegal under UK domestic law to enter British territory without permission, but crown prosecutors take into account a person\u0027s status as an asylum seeker when deciding whether to charge them with an offence.Home Secretary Priti Patel has said last week that she could send in the Royal Navy to intercept boats arriving in Britain, after Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage accused a group of people arriving on a Kent beach of an invasion. The Independent reported this week that the UK is pushing ahead with the deportion of asylum seekers arriving in boats, with France and Spain seen as viable return countries.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a moment that had been a long, long time coming, and when it did Kamala Harris grasped it with both hands.On a night freighted with history, the senator from California officially accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination to be vice president, the first woman of colour thus selected by a major party, and only the sixth woman in total in the US ever added to a ticket.In a speech that spread over more 15 minutes, and perhaps representing the de facto keynote address on the third night of the convention despite top billing going to Barack Obama, her words were at once warm and hopeful, yet firm. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe paid respect to the political pioneers that had gone before her, breaking the ground that would help allow a black American woman of South Asian heritage, build a career such as hers. And she paid tribute to her family, particularly her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who came to the US at the age of 18, and raised Kamala and her sister after their parents orced. She died in 2009. Ms Harris said that when her mother gave birth to her, aged just 25, at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California, she may have struggled to see just what lay in store for her daughter.DNC 2020“On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America,” she said. Ever since Joe Biden indicated in March of this year that were he to secure the nomination he would choose a woman as his running mate, there had been widespread anticipation he would select a woman of colour. Such a strategy appeared all the more vital and fair, following the killing by police in Minneapolis of an unarmed black man, triggering protests for racial justice that swept not just across the US, but around the world.In selecting the 55-year-old former prosecutor, Mr Biden said his main priority had been to find someone who could step into the job on day one, not merely a sound bite for a 77-year-old man, who will be the nation’s oldest president by far should he defeat Donald Trump in November.In her comments, Ms Harris noted that this week marked the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th amendment, which gave some women – white women – the right to vote.“So many of the black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting, long after its ratification. But they were undeterred,” she said. “Without fanfare or recognition, they organised, testified, rallied, marched, and fought—not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And these women inspired us to pick up the torch, and fight on.”She named several female civil rights and political leaders — “Mary Church Terrell and Mary Mcleod Bethune. Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash. Constance Baker Motley and Shirley Chisholm”. Ms Chisholm was both the first black congresswoman and the first black woman to make a run for the White House, back in 1972.“We’re not often taught their stories,” she added. “But as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders.”Trump’s strategy for dealing with the DNC is about to backfireMichelle Obama to hail Biden’s ‘grit and passion’ Why I can’t shake my disgust about being forced to vote for BidenMichelle Obama’s keynote speech at DNC expected to be major hitHer comments followed by an equally impassioned and hard-edged address by Mr Obama, who probably for the first time in four years in public, criticised Mr Trump by name. He said he feared for the state of the nation’s democracy should he secure a second term.“I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care,” said Mr Obama. “But he never did.“If Mr Obama’s speech was heavy, and sombre, Ms Harris was able to inject a fair degree of energy into her words. Joe Biden will be relying on this verve to drive his campaign in the final three months, across a country beset by anxiety, economic hardship and the challenge of combatting the coronavirus pandemic. “Years from now, this moment will have passed,” said Ms Harris.  “And our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and they’re gonna ask us: Where were you when the stakes were so high? And we will tell them, not just how we felt – we will tell them what we did.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Vladimir Putin announced regulatory approval for a test vaccine last week, claiming initial trials at Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute had demonstrated it was safe, effective and formed long-term immunity.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTested on only a few dozen people so far – including the president’s own daughter – Russian scientists will now oversee tests on tens of thousands of people at 45 medical centres across the country.The mass-testing process will be supervised by a foreign research body when it starts next week and data will be published in an academic journal later this month, backers of the project said on Thursday.“A range of countries is running an information war against the Russian vaccine,” Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) that is backing the vaccine, told a briefing.Mr Dmitriev did not give details of the foreign research organisation supervising the project to ensure the data collection is fully in line with international standards – but claimed data would be provided to the World Health Organisation (WHO).Scientists around the world have responded with great scepticism to Russia’s decision to approve the vaccine before trials involve thousands of participants. Such “phase 3” trials are usually considered essential precursors for a vaccine to secure regulatory approval.Professor Francois Balloux, director of University College London’s Genetics Institute, said the decision to approve the vaccine so quickly had been “reckless and foolish”.WHO Europe’s office said on Thursday that it has begun discussions with Russia to try to obtain more information about the vaccine and results of the initial trial.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We want to take our time to really understand where the vaccine’s at and to get as full information as possible on the steps that have already been taken.”Experts raise concern at Putin’s claim to first coronavirus vaccineRussian officials said doctors might start getting vaccinated with their experimental shot this month and that mass campaigns could begin in October.Russia has received requests for up to a billion doses of the vaccine from around the world and has capacity to produce 500 million doses per year via manufacturing partnerships, said Mr Dmitriev.Mexico has told Moscow it is eager to have the Russian coronavirus vaccine once testing for the product is complete, Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Wednesday.After a meeting with Russia’s ambassador to Mexico, Mr Ebrard said on Twitter that he had communicated the country wanted “the vaccine as soon as possible”.Two other potential Covid-19 vaccine candidates have already started such studies in the US and elsewhere, and will require about 30,000 people to receive the immunisation and be tracked afterward.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And none of the worries that they had before the explosion, have gone away. “People still can’t afford food. People are still out of work – and 70,000 more have now reportedly been left unemployed. For Lebanon to have a chance at getting back on its feet, we need to stop the coronavirus from spreading any further.”Amid the recent surge in cases, the Lebanese government announced earlier this week that it will impose a two-week lockdown to contain the virus.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a particularly cold June morning in northern Kenya when rangers working in Loisaba Nature Conservancy first spotted a large male elephant limping near a watering hole. The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animals.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHowever the impact of Covid-19 means help is urgently needed to protect elephants against an increased threat of slaughter.In 2015 Space for Giants worked with international conservation organisation The Nature Conservancy to establish Loisaba as a conservation trust in perpetuity, protecting a critical habitat for a ersity of endangered species.Covering an area of 57,000 acres in the county of Laikipia, Loisaba has an increasing resident population of elephants, estimated at around 800, as well as an abundance of other fauna, including more than 260 bird species and 57 mammals, such as lions, leopards and cheetahs.Space for Giants supports wildlife monitoring, security and conservancy management in Loisaba, financed by The Nature Conservancy and other donors, including San Diego Zoo. The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

Heres a recap of the day.Have a great evening.Despite the highest number of As and A*s this year for GCSEs , there will be some kids today who havent got the grades they wanted.Unfortunately they wont be able to appeal them, Ofqual confirmed today. Guidance from Ofqual # published on GCSE results day # confirms schools and colleges can only appeal where there has been an administrative error with the centre assessment grade# notthey dont like it.It said: #If a student is concerned that any reasonable adjustments were not taken into account when their school or college determined their CAG, they should discuss this with their school or college.#But a pupil will be able to take their concerns about bias or discrimination over teachers grades to the relevant exam board, Ofqual said.Data showing the dference between the algorithm-based grades and A-level students new grades # which rely heavily on teacher assessments # show History, English Literature and Biology were hit hardest by being downgraded. The share of kids getting A or above for History was marked down by the algorithm from . per cent to . per cent # a drop of . per cent. English Literature had the top band of students marked down by . per cent to . per cent. But other subjects such as German, Music and Design Technology only saw minor changes in grades with drops of . per cent, . per cent and  per cent respectively. Sam Freedman, an ex Department for Education adviser, said some kids have been given “barmy” results.He said: “There are schools where pupils who would have taken foundation tier papers – where the top possible grade is a    have been awarded a  in the algorithm.“While this is certainly less problematic than young people missing out on places, it is not great that some students will have grades higher than they could have possibly achieved.”He warned that some kids could end up on tough courses “they won’t be suited for”.Some schools where all pupils have taken separate biology, physics and chemistry GCSEs for the first time have seen ridiculously high grades dished out, he said.This is because the algorithm has upgraded them to match past years, when only the brightest kids took the separate sciences.He added: “Another extraordinary bit of GCSE upgrading – a school that usually enters lots of native speakers in a language GCSE didn’t this year.“This year’s cohort has been upgraded  or  grades because the native speakers got top marks.”Parents of GCSE students looked relieved and proud after months of having their kids learn at home during lockdown.Teachers have warned the unprecedented level of high GCSEs will spark a dash for the best spots at sixth form colleges. Steve Chalke, head of the Oasis academy chain, told The Sun: “On the one level, the rise in GCSE results is good news for some colleges which are struggling because they will have more applicants.“For others that are full and popular, they will find themselves in the same situation as the top universities have been – with a surge in demand.“There is going to be a scramble. “The kids are going to get home with their results.“And you can guarantee that hundreds of thousands of parents are saying to their children #  so now you have got these results which are really good, we have got to get down to that local sixth form  and book your place right now.”general secretary of the University and College Union Jo Grady has demanded the Government #fix the mess# of releasing results for Btec students.Exam board Pearson asked schools and colleges on Wednesday not to publish Level  and  results in the vocational qualications on Thursday to give them more time to recalculate the grades.Ms Grady said: #If we see a similar increase in Btec pass rates as we have seen in GCSEs then many more students will be able to go to college.#The row over Gavin Williamson’s future exploded into Tory civil war today after the outspoken new boss of the Scottish Conservatives suggested he should quit after the exams fiasco.Douglas Ross plunged the Government into a cross-border war of words after urging the embattled Education Secretary to “reflect on what happened” and refused to back him staying in his job.Mr Ross said: “I’m not here to say in your report that I think Gavin Williamson has done a great job and he should continue.“I think he has to reflect on what happened to so many pupils in England, students who were concerned for four days, because we had the exact same up here in Scotland for a week.”Read the full story here.Gavin Williamson was directly warned that the A-level and GCSE grading system could mean hundreds of thousands of students missed out on the grades they deserved # but chose to go ahead with the bungled algorithm formula anyway, according to The Times. A senior source at the Department for Education revealed former direct-general of DfE Sir John Coles wrote to Mr Williamson in early July to warn about the accuracy of the algorithm. He said at best the model would mean only  per cent of results were accurate. Ofquals own tests of its algorithm # published last week # found it was only  per cent accurate.

Gavin Horgan, of Millfield School in Somerset, said: #It is wonderful that in GCSEs today, and at A-level, students will now gain the best grades possible in the circumstances.#They absolutely deserve that, and they never deserved the shameful approach that was taken to get to this point by the Government and exam boards.#However, bigger hurdles are ahead. The results received by students and the hiatus in education for many across the country, means that we will have legacy issues which will, in all likelihood, last a generation.#The pressure on the university system, the threat to post- universities, which are a vital element of our further education tapestry, and the knock-on implications of grade inflation for Year  students going into A-level studies this year and for those same students next year when they look to apply to university, cannot simply be written off in the same way that results have been this year.#Sadly, we are just at the very start of the problem.# Dr Tim Bradshaw, boss of the Russell Group which represents the country’s best universities, said a new army of doctors, nurses and teachers will emerge from the Covid generation.He said: “This pandemic has highlighted more than ever the importance of our fantastic healthcare services and the need to invest in them.“So I am pleased we are removing the cap on these courses and providing additional funding so more students can take up their places now and become our future doctors and healthcare professionals.” All A LEVEL students who got the right grades can go to their first choice university, ministers have guaranteed today.Controversial caps on places to study to be a medic, vet or teacher were also torn up and extra cash pledged for the courses.Under-fire ministers made the promise in a desperate bid to douse the fury over the A Levels shambles. A whopping , bitterly disappointed students lost out on their first choice uni in the markings fiasco, but now have the grades to go.But thousands of teens with boosted grades may have to wait a year before they can go to their first choice because some of the most popular courses are already full.The National Education Unions co-general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said the Government now #must put an end# to the #incompetence# around the issuing of the Btec results. Hundreds of thousands of students are still waiting for final grades after an th house decision not to release them today. Dr Mary Bousted said: #Teachers know their students better than any model or algorithm and it will be a relief to many that the grades they receive are now a fairer reflection of their achievements.#To add to the GCSE and A-level fiasco, the decision byPearson not to issue Btec results at the eleventh hour compounds the upsetting and chaotic experience for students.#Government must put an end to this incompetence and work quickly to ensure every young person gets the grades they deserve to move on to the next stages of their lives.#The Government has lted student caps on medicine, dentistry, veterinary science and teaching course for all UK students who receive the marks needed to meet their offer. After universities warned they simply would not be able to fit extra students in practical-heavy courses such as medicine the Government has also given a bonus grant to help fund these subjects. Universities minister Michelle Donelan said: #This pandemic has highlighted more than ever the importance of our fantastic healthcare services and the need to invest in them. #So I am pleased we are removing the cap on these courses and providing additional funding so more students can take up their places now and become our future doctors and healthcare professionals.#Exam regulator Qualications Wales has estimated .% of students received A* or A grade in their GCSEs # compared to .% in .It said the revised results for GCSE and the Key Stage  Skills Challenge Certicate are #substantially higher than results in recent years#.It also said .% of students received cumulative A* to C grade GCSE # compared to .% in .The provisional cumulative A* to A-grade results of the Key Stage  Skills Challenge Certicate have risen from % last year to .% this yearThese kids have said well done on GCSEs the socially distanced way # skipping handshakes and bumping elbows instead.Head of the Association of School  College Leaders Geoff Barton has congratulated students for their results under #extraordinarily dficult circumstances.#He said: #This generation of young people has suffered a degree of uncertainty and disruption that is without precedent.##They lost out on the normal rites of passage of leaving school, and on the chance to show what they could do in a set of exams.#Mr Barton added that GCSE students had to deal with a week of anxiety because of the A-level u-turn #to seethey were going to lose out again because a computer algorithm might downgrade them#.

A stf of a game show dreamt up by Simon Cowell’s Over The Top Productions company and hosted by Stephen Mulhern, who charged on to the set, Saturday night, shouting: “Oh yes, I hope you’re ready. This is going to be good.”It wasn’t, obviously. It was going to be anything but good.Rolling In It is a show where every single thing is working against it being good, in fact, from the fixtures and fittings to the ropey old format where they’ve attempted to fuse the random “thrill” of Tipping Point with Who Wants To Be A Millionaire , minus the decent cash prize.The technology here isn’t exactly state of the art either. It’s an old arcade game. So, before answering  lobotomised questions , the contestants must roll a gigantic coin down a chute which can end up in a cash prize basket, but more often than not ends up bankrupting them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, as you’ve probably noticed, is currently playing exactly the same game with the British economy and probably thinks Rolling In It is a fantastic idea for a game show.ITV in its heart of hearts, though, clearly does not. How can you tell Because they’ve had to ditch the normal, run-of-the-mill contestants and partner-up some visibly reluctant ITV celebs with X Factor-style “characters” who are meant to ert your attention from the game.Saturday night, we had a live wire called Jana, who announced her arrival by telling Mulhern he’d “lost weight”. “What ”The week before there was another handful by the name of Lesley, who brought proceedings to a temporary halt, at the introductions’ stage, with this announcement. “I arrange funerals.”I’d stick around then, Lesley. I’ve checked this show’s vital signs and I think we’re talking weeks rather than months.I worry, too, about the long-term prospects of ITV in the current climate.The share price is down, advertising’s hit an all-time low, Ant  Dec are wintering in Rhyl and the new home for I’m A Celeb is literally a folly.The very remote possibility exists, I will admit, that Rolling In It is part of a deep-state plan to frighten everyone back to work — “Return to the office NOW, or you’re getting a second series of this rubbish.”But I don’t think we really need to look beyond the obvious lockdown explanation here.The cupboard is bare.ITV has simply run out of anything  worth showing, we’re now on to the stuff that was never meant to see the light of day, and as good as it’s ever going to get for Rolling In It is Gemma Collins revealing that: “My intuition is telling me shot put.”Then please go with your intuition, Gemma. Team GB demands it.Nasser Hussein: “The three non-negotiable players were Atherton, Stewart, Thorpe and Gough.”Paul Merson: “Every City signing is just another cog in the jigsaw.”Steven Gerrard: “The quality on the bench is the quality that’s not even on the bench.” BBC’S re-run of the original and arguably best Line Of Duty series concluded, last night, with the Organised Crime Gang still on the loose and DCI Tony Gates putting his tortured Irish wolfhound out of its misery before killing himself.The character I always feel sorry for, watching this  version of the show, though, is Jackie Laverty, Gates’ miserable girlfriend, who had her throat slit in the second episode.She was then stashed in Terry’s freezer, just behind the crispy pancakes and Cornettos, until her corpse was dramatically rediscovered in the fourth episode of the fth series, in April , looking almost as gormless as DI Buckells.In the process, she missed: The show’s big move to Belfast, in series two, the DI Denton years, with Keeley Hawes, balaclava man, Thandie Newton’s appearance, Ted Hastings’ long, dark nights of the soul at the Edge Park hotel, and DS Steve Arnott’s subtle transition from grey tank tops to lurid waistcoats, straight after he slept with DC Georgia Trotman at the beginning of the second run.I’d imagine Jackie actress Gina McKee casts a frosty stare or two in the direction of her agent as well.Line Of Duty may never have been so gloriously easy to understand, or free from abbreviations, as it was in series one, but while her character’s been solidying at Terry’s gaff it has become the most consistently brilliant drama of the decade.Sadly for her, Jackie Laverty is not actually due to defrost fully until series seven and the next runis going to be the last.No official word yet as to when that production will reach our screens but, you can guarantee already, Line Of Duty’s final episodes will be the television event of the year.BBC’s new sitcom Mandy  Well I came and I watched without laughing.

In fact, I wonderin some ways we’ve ever had it so good.In football, the Leeds, West Brom and Fulham fans among us have the precious memories of heart-stopping promotion moments to cherish for ever.Similarly, while Liverpool fans would have preferred to have partied with their team, none of them will ever forget the evening Cha did them a favour and the title was theirs. And the intensity of Watford and Bournemouth fans’ misery at relegation will have been no less keenly felt without them being present.In fact, let’s be honest, under the circumstances they might well have been far better off at home anyway.Whether we were there or not turns out not to have mattered quite as much as we thought it would.Watching at home, we even got used to the crowd noise sound-effects. They seemed like the daftest idea ever at first, but so skilfully was it done that I was quite at home with it by the end of the season.I’ve loved the cricket too. I can’t tell you how much I normally enjoy being there for these matches, they’re the greatest joy of the sporting summer. Hordes of inebriated, sunburnt fans howling on their teams, whether I’m one of them, or watching at home, are all part of it. But watching the West Indies and Pakistan Test series unfold even without the mayhem of the crowds has been wonderful.Will, for example, Chris Woakes’ performance in the first Pakistan Test live any less long in our fondest memories for having been played out behind closed doors  Will Chris himself be any less delighted with it  Will his grandchildren care as he rocks them on his knee and tells them about his four fabulous days at Old Trafford in the weird summer of  Actually, you could forgive Chris for not being desperate to have crowds coming back. He played out of his skin behind closed doors in Manchester, and saw his football team, Aston Villa, save themselves from relegation in another deserted stadium days earlier.As for the snooker, pandemic or not, spectators in or out or a bit of both, we were still captivated.As it happens, I watched the Fulham v Brentford play-off final, and some of the snooker, in a sports bar in a hotel in Dubrovnik, Croatia, while an absolutely apocalyptic electric storm raged outside. I sat there with a handful of other Brits, riveted to the screens even as the roof of the place proved unequal to the task of keeping out the rain. What I can only describe as a waterfall soon started cascading into the middle of this bar. And yet we watched on, intently, as teams of Croatian hotel staff rushed around us with mops, buckets and a big kind of water Hoover thing. Nothing could tear us away. Even when something fused and it all went dark, we just filed on to the terrace and watched the storm with one eye, while with the other we watched data from the snooker and football flash up on our phones. Pandemics, floods and whatever  — bring on the plague of locusts — nothing, but nothing, can stop the sport getting to us, and us getting engaged with the sport.And nothing, ever, can stop Ronnie O’Sullivan being Ronnie. First he said the players were being treated like lab rats, then he said a lot of his fellow lab rats were hopeless snooker players anyway. And then he goes and wins the thing. You can’t keep a good bad mad man down, can you Why has sport still managed to grab us by the scruff of our necks in these troubled times  I think there are three reasons: Firstly, we missed it so much when it wasn’t there at all. We loved it before, but we really didn’t know how much until it was completely taken away for us.Secondly, without the crowds, though they are missed, what we’ve been left with is the naked, untrammelled intensity of sporting endeavour. There’s no noise and fervour in the stadia to detract from the purity of the contest.And thirdly, most importantly, the bond between sport and us, between those who play it and those who watch it, is so strong that nothing, but nothing, can ever break it.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He added “paranoia” set in amid tensions over the trip, saying he has been contacted by some “shadowy” people and had mysterious calls to his mobile phone. The explorer told The Sun Online: “I sat down on one of the benches by the mausoleum - that temple type area.“Just sitting there knowing who has sat there before and the figures who have been there, it was surreal and it was unreal.”FBI agents last year raided Little Saint James as they built a case against the billionaire sex trafficker - and the island is believed to still be owned by Epstein’s estate.It became known as “pedo island”, “orgy island” and the “island of sin” - but the creepy paedophile affectionately dubbed it “Little Saint Jeff”.Bracco said: “There is active security there - I visited the site twice over the week and one of the times was in daytime, which was a little bit riskier.“The route we took we avoided a lot of the cameras on the island - along with the workers and guards.“We got pretty lucky. But we planned it a few months ahead, spoke to locals and we knew what we were dealing with.“I wouldn’t suggest anyone go there unless you really know what you are doing.”He explained the main reason they wanted to explore the island was due to persistent rumours of tunnels hidden beneath its surface.While the duo couldn’t nail down the subterranean stories, he said locals told them about “amazing” levels of construction with huge amounts of cement being shipped to the island.Local rumours state this may have been to fill in the tunnels, he said. Bracco believes he and Jon are just the second people to be on the island since Epstein’s arrest and death aside from the contractors, guards and FBI agents.One of the most infamous structures on the island is the bizarre blue and white temple which used to have a gold dome on top before it blew away. The explorer described how the structure felt cheap and had bizarre features, such as painted on fake doors with the initials “JE” inscribed next to them.He said: “Its very strange to know how much money this guy had to see such a low quality of a structure there. “It makes you think, is this a distraction from something  ”The only way to get into the structure is through a glass sliding door through which you can see the whole interior. Bracco suspects the island may be preparing for new ownership with the changes such as the tennis court, but the site is still believed to be owned by Epstein’s estate.He said they constantly feared the sight of headlights heading towards them down the island’s access roads as they snuck around. “There was one super serious part when we didn’t account for what I believe was an infrared camera by the communications tower,” he said.“It was pointing directly at us, andthere was a sensor facing us and depending on what software they had it could have set off an alarm. So we had to rush off pretty quickly.”Originally he intended to keep his identity a secret, but after posting the first previews on his Instagram account @zocbex - someone leaked his name online.Deciding to get ahead, he said: “They were trying to use my name against me - in an attempt to disarm them I decided to release most things with my name attached.“I have had some interesting and shadowy people contact me, a few calls to my personal cellphone. So paranoia set in.”Little Saint James is the centre of many of the allegations against Epstein and his alleged madam Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as conspiracy theories.The island is believed to be where much of his sexual abuse was committed and where he allegedly entertained powerful friends such as Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew.Victims have claimed to have witnessed sex taking place openly on the island, such as Maxwell having “girl on girl” orgies by the pool. Epstein victim Virginia Roberts claims she had sex with Prince Andrew once on the island - as well at Maxwell’s house in London and Epstein’s mansion in New York.Andrew strongly denies any allegations against him and said he had no knowledge of any wrongdoing while friends with Maxwell and Epstein.Clinton has also denied he ever spent time on the island - blasting claims earlier this year as “lies” as they resurfaced in Netflix docuseries Filthy Rich.His office has said the former President knew nothing about the terrible crimes committed by Epstein and there is no evidence to suggest he is linked to the underage sex investigation. Pictures emerged yesterday of him getting a massage from one of Epstein’s accusers on the paedo’s plane.Maxwell has denied any involvement in Epstein’s sex ring and last month pleaded not guilty to four charges related to child sex trafficking and two counts of perjury.Her lawyers have accused the victims of trying to turn her into a scapegoat since the death of Epstein.Epstein killed himself in his cell at a New York prison in August last year while awaiting trial on charges - depriving many victims of justice.Maxwell has been accused of taking part in the grooming and abuse of dozens of underage girls by Epstein.She is alleged to have acted as his alleged madam, pimp or fixer who would recruit victims for him, such as approaching Virginia while she was working at Donlad Trump’s resort Mar-a-Lago.Victims allege they were duped with claims she was recruiting models of masseurs - only to them be abused by Epstein and Maxwell.The current charges against her relate to allegations by three alleged victims in particular.Meanwhile, court documents have revealed Epstein is alleged to have dressed up a victim, , in “little girl’s underwear” before he raped her.. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tower is only the Tower when the people are here.“The ravens have always been so important to the Tower because they’ve been surrounded by myths and legends.

Editor’s decision is final.Summer visitor numbers would usually be above , but because of Covid- they have fallen to less than  a day — leaving the birds restless for more company.Royal protocol dictates that there have to be at least six birds in the Tower at any one time — plus a “spare”. The current ravens are Jubilee, Harris, Gripp, Rocky, Erin, Poppy and Merlina.Mr Skae said that during lockdown they got bored and lonely because there were no full bins to rummage or people handing over their lunch.He had to give the birds teddies, footballs and squeaky dog toys to keep them entertained.He also encouraged Beefeaters to throw them their leftovers.Mr Skae added: “It’s been tough because the ravens only saw me or one warden walking by during the lockdown. They depend on tourists.He revealed Merlina and Jubilee are now known as “Bonnie and Clyde” after reaching as far as the visitors’ exit and also tapping on the windows of Beefeaters’ homes to beg for food.Mr Skae said: “Never in a raven’s history have we seen fewer people in the Tower of London.Even in World War Two, there were still hundreds in and around.”Last year the Tower attracted three million visitors. That made it the UK’s most popular paid-for attraction, with two thirds of visitors from overseas.According to legend, Charles II ordered ravens be kept there after he was warned thatthey ever left “the kingdom will fall”.Concern for the birds comes weeks after the Tower announced that Beefeaters are facing redundancies for the first time.THE continued presence of ravens at the Tower of London has for centuries been linked to the very preservation of Britain.Six are always kept there and legend has it that the Crown, the kingdom and the Tower itself will fallthey ever leave.In the times of Henry VIII, the birds are said to have sat eerily silent on the battlements in  while Anne Boleyn was beheaded.The ravens used to peck the eyes of executed prisoners, it is claimed.In the s, King Charles II’s astronomer, John Flamsteed, complained the birds’ chattering put him off his work.When the king ordered that they be destroyed — he was allegedly warned that dire luck would follow for the Crown and country.Instead, he instructed they be fed and sheltered forever.Despite the impressive tales, some historians believe the “Tower’s raven mythology is likely to be a Victorian flight of fantasy”.It is thought they were the first pets kept by Beefeaters. There was a craze for ravens after an  Edgar Allen Poe poem. Ian Brown of rock band The Stone Roses once told Melody Maker: “We’re all anti-royalist, anti-patriarch, cos its , time to get real!“When the ravens leave the Tower, England shall fall they say.“We want to be there shooting the ravens.”The Tower was built by William the Conquerer in the early s. The site now includes a fortress, palace and prison.Inmates have included Anne Boleyn, Sir Thomas More and Guy Fawkes.Since the time of Charles II, they’ve enjoyed almost constant human company — but for months now they’ve been almost entirely friendless.And it seems the quiet le doesn’t suit them: Beefeaters report that two of the birds were caught trying to sneak out.Legend has it thatthe ravens fly away, the Crown — and Britain — will fall.Soyou’re wondering what to do with the kids this long summer holiday, why not consider a trip to the Tower You never know, you might just save the country while you’re there.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said: The timing is worrying, because thousands of students were due to get their results in the morning and others have already got results which we know will not go down, but which might improve.The Department for Education confirmed that no student will see a result downgraded as a result of the review, but acknowledged the decision will be disappointing for students. It comes after a week of chaos for A-Level students and universities following the governments u-turn on exam results.Around % of students last Thursday had results downgraded by the Ofqual algorithm - with many missing out on university places as a result.Students are now able to use their teachers’ recommended gradesthey are higher than the grades issued to them on Results Day - which were determined by a controversial algorithm designed by exam regulator Ofqual.But it has left leading universities scrambling to cope with a surge in admissions as many students have now met their first-choice offers with their new grades.There are also fears that many lower-ranked universities could lose out on a signicant chunk of their student intake as prospective undergraduates prioritise their first-choice offers. Meanwhile, embattled education secretary Gavin Williamson has refused to resign over the A-levels fiasco.Mr Williamson insisted he was incredibly sorry for the debacle, but appeared to sht the blame onto Ofqual - claiming the regulator didnt deliver the system that we had been reassured and believed that would be in place.The Department of Education today reiterated that it had full confidence in Ofqual and its leadership in their role as independent regulator ahead of GCSE results day tomorrow.Tonight, The Sun reported that Cabinet colleagues believe Williamson is ‘on his last le’ and will be sackedschools reopening is botched.Ministers and MPs have said he would not be able to survive another scandal next monthhe blunders Mr Johnson’s flagship pledge to reopen schools.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our young people are psyching themselves up for their results, wanting to plan their futures and the next step in their studies and being let down again and again by the government. They are in the middle of an utter fiasco that’s in no way their making.Meanwhile, it was reported last night that Gavin Williamson was warned of the results debacle weeks before.The education secretary has defied calls to resign over the debacle and is now said to be on his last le - with a likelihood of being sacked next month.A senior source at the Department of Education told The Times that Sir Jon Coles, a former director-general at the Department, wrote to Williamson early last month expressing concern about Ofqual’s controversial algorithm.In the letter, Sir Jon warned that the model being used for GCSE and A-Level grading would at best only be  per cent accurate - resulting in hundreds of thousands of students receiving botched grades. Ofqual’s own testing of the model found the accuracy of the model to be in the range of  to  per cent.According to the Times, Mr Williamson then held a video-conference with Sir Jon to discuss the points raised in the letter in mid-July.However, the education secretary chose to push ahead with the plans anyway - fearing accusations of grade inflation or a delay to exam results.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Spooks denied it was linked to ongoing rumours of the tyrants poor health, and said it does not mean Kim has picked her as his successor to rule.

Kims sister is not the only one to receive new powers either - as the dictator handed out new jobs to other senior regime figures.However, the apparent promotion comes as she has reportedly been missing from two high level meeting this month. The back-to-back absences on August  and August  sparked speculation she may have fallen out of favour, reports NK News.Martin Weiser, an independent analyst who studies North Korean media, said before the announcement that her absence pointed to a major coming sht.Cheong Seong-Chang, director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute, added: Compared to others, she enjoys relative freedom from technicalities.She could have stayed out of the scene, but still could have been involved in the preparation and the meeting’s procedure somehow.Kim Yo-jongs last appearance alongside the secretive kingdoms ruling elite was at a conference in Pyongyang on July .She was also seen picking up a cigarette butt dropped by Kim during an inspection visit to a chicken factory last month.Sources claimed last month Kims sister was behind the blowing up of the highly symbolic liaison office in the border town of Kaesong.

In a bizarre quirk of the law, the mum-of-three has been hit by the two-child limit on benefits - even though there is an exemption for children born of rape. The unusual case highlights a flaw in the Tory cap, which bans any extra Universal Credit for “third or subsequent” children born after April . The woman in her early s, who lives with her husband in North Yorkshire, told us she had a child in  after being raped by an ex-partner. She later had two more children by other partners, with her most recent child born last Autumn. In December her Universal Credit was increased by £ over two months for the third child, under an exemption for children born to “rape, abuse or coercive control”. But Jobcentre officials then U-turned, stopped new payments and began clawing the money back - because the offence was a decade ago. Have you been affected by this issue or want to bring a similar injustice to light  Email your story to webnews@mirror. In order to qualy for the so-called ‘rape clause’, the child born of rape would have had to be her third child, born after April . Because she made a choice to have a third child after the cut-off date, without being raped, the two-child limit applied to her like anyone . The woman told the Mirror: “I think it’s very unjust. It doesn’t make much sense because whether it’s the first child or the last child, it’s still the result of the same incident.” The woman said the birth of her first child was “like a horror film”, saying she was abandoned by her family and had postnatal depression. She added: “In the beginning I was really scared, but I’m completely against abortion. At the end of the day, she’s still my daughter.”  Her husband who told us he works but on low pay, said: Universal Credit can’t help us out - just because of the order in which they were born.” The case sparked fresh calls to completely axe the two-child limit, which has cut the benefits of , children in , households since . Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said the two-child limit “can add poverty on top of abuse.” She said: “The limit should not apply where any child in the family has been born as a result of rape or abuse, regardless of when this happened.” Campaigning SNP MP Alison Thewliss added: “This case demonstrates just how cruel a policy the two-child limit and the rape clause really is.  I find it incredibly disturbing that this woman has had to tell a DWP official about how her child was conceived as the result of rape to be given access to financial leline, only to then have that support clawed back due to bureaucratic error. It shouldn’t matter in what order children were born, the family should be entitled to support. The Mirror is aware of the woman’s identity but is abiding by her legal right to anonymity.She grew up in Europe and moved to live with her English husband before the birth of her third child. The couple accuse her former partner of physically overpowering her for sex, and then disappearing when discovering she was pregnant. The woman, who is now pregnant with a fourth child, did not make a criminal complaint to police in her native country. However, this is not a requirement of the ‘rape clause’ because the situation is so sensitive.

Since the easing of lockdown, Kate has ed to work with a number of socially-distanced engagements, and sheaposs looked very glad to be back out meeting people. However looking a little deeper, body language expert Judi James has spotted some slightly worrying moments.She tells the Express : In between her smiles and laughter there have also been quite dramatic glimpses of a sadder and more thoughtful-looking facial expression from Kate.This might be a sign of the added pressure sheaposs now under in terms of working flat out.  Judi noticed these moments while comparing Kateaposs recent outings to those before coronavirus, when she says the Duchess is always focused on making hubby William laugh.She explains: Kate is often being seen trying to make her husband laugh in public and indulging in more frequent bouts of actual laughter herself when she is making royal visits. But she also believes thataposs Kateaposs confidence has come on leaps and bounds, adding: She seems happier to acknowledge that she is popular in her own right now and that she has earned the respect and possibly admiration of the Queen too.  In recent years Kate has taken on a number of extra patronages, including several previously held by the Queen and Prince Philip. Like all parents in the UK, Kate and William took on the role of home schooling their oldest children Prince George and Princess Charlotte, something they admitted was tough at times.

Police are investigating after William, not his real name, was punched by a fellow passenger at Clapham Junction station and required hospital treatment for a severe laceration and stitches for a head wound. Along with a friend, William had been arguing with South Western Railway staff by the ticket barrier because one worker was not wearing a mask.

In response, the man turns around and walks away from his pram shouting donapost f****** start on me and punches William, knocking him to the floor unconscious. The man quickly leaves the area with his pram and child, while William is seen bleeding on the ground. A member of rail staff is heard saying: I told you both to go, didnapost I William later explained: My friend asked one of the station staff a totally reasonable and polite question aposare you exempt from wearing a maskapos. Sheaposd snapped back saying aposnone of your businessapos. Admittedly I lost my temper a bit.

No idea who he is, just some random person who was walking without a face covering assumed when I was talking to the guard just flew off straight away bang. In the footage, staff did not pursue the man but could be heard saying they have called emergency services. South Western Railway said the member of staff who was not wearing a mask had a medical exemption. It said the assault was an altercation between members of the public and staff had assisted with first aid and alerted the police.

Emily Ingold, , tipped the scales at st lb - and needed a seatbelt extension in her car as she struggled to fit behind the wheel. After appearing on a TV programme called Britainaposs Fattest people, Emily, from Kettering, Northants, squeezed into a size  clothing. But when the show helped her realise her dangerous weight problem, she underwent gastric surgery - and committed to changing her lestyle for the sake of her children. Now, sheaposs more than  stone lighter, and continuing to lose weight - and is absolutely unrecognisable. Emily, who is mum to Harry, six, and four-year-old Riley, said: I had an addiction to eating food as soon as I thought of food, I wanted it. I would be anxious, angry and upsetI didn’t get it. I was referred to an eating disorder clinic and then some counselling. Le is so much better for my boys as well - I couldnapost play with them without getting out of breath and now we can do so much more together and they have definitely noticed a dference. I couldn’t do everyday stuff. I had to get my young children to help me do the washing because I couldnapost bend down to put the clothes in the machine. They need me - I didnapost want them to lose their mum at such a young age but I would fail at every diet I tried. It wasnapost fair on them and they shouldnapost have had to deal with that. The teaching assistant says she has always had a bad relationship with food from a young age and would regularly steal food from around the house.  I would have my dinner and then I would finish my sisteraposs dinner behind my parentaposs back. I would help myself to snacks and my parents would have to stop me but as I got older and I started earning my own money, thataposs when it really spiralled out of control as I had the freedom to buy and eat what I wanted to. I didnapost notice the weight going on until I had to order unorm for a job I had at the time and I ordered a size  but it was way too small and I actually needed a . By the time she had her children, Emily was a size  and was eating most of the day. She struggled to fit into her car, but would drive to McDonalds every morning after dropping the children off at nursery for a take away breakfast - followed by multi-packs of crisps for snacks and a takeaway most nights. She added: When I was at my heaviest, I was fully aware of it, my body was telling me that I needed to stop eating - my back hurt, I was having dficulty breathing and it got to a point where I thought I was going to die. It was horrible. I was down all the time, tired all the time, I had no energy, I was in constant pain with my back, legs and hips.  I struggled to walk up the stairs or go for a walk without my back being in agony I could hardly fit behind the steering wheel and needed a seat belt extender in order to fit in comfortably. I was so depressed I couldnapost find the motivation to kickstart my weight loss. Emily appeared in the Channel  documentary, Shut Ins: Britainaposs Fattest People, at her heaviest in  and, in the show, underwent drastic weight-loss surgery. The sleeve gastrectomy, fully funded by the production, removed approximately % of Emilyaposs stomach and has changed her le for the better.She added: I saw the ad for the show whilst scrolling on Facebook and there was a casting call looking for aposmorbidly obese young adultsapos and I was only  at the time so I applied - it was the best thing Iaposve ever done.The surgery was a turning point for me as soon as I woke up I felt instantly dferent. People say to me, aposdo you ever regret having it doneapos but I don’t know whether I would be here without it or not. I wouldnapost have been able to afford the surgery on my own as it would have cost me about £, so I feel extremely lucky that I was given the opportunity - it really has changed my le.  Now, Emily is getting closer to her goal weight by the day and canapost wait to see what the future brings. I would love to get to a size  - that would be my ideal dress size and I would be so happy with that. The surgery does limit me a lot - I canapost eat huge portions of food and I have to be really careful with my sugar intake but I wouldnapost change it. I have so much more energy, I can do everyday things and most importantly I can finally play with my children and go out for walks with them which is the best feeling.

Fuming Theresa Webber made the discovery when she stripped off the cover before she left the hotel in Bristol because she wanted to leave less work for housekeeping staff.But the -year-old retiree says her skin was “crawling” when she saw a huge brown mark on the duvet she had been sleeping under for two nights, Bristol Live reports.The chain said the stain was caused by coffee. Ms Webber had travelled from her home in France to visit her son in Bristol at the weekend, staying in the Travelodge during that time. She said: “When I was checking out, I thought that to save them the trouble I would strip the duvet cover off. “When I saw that disgusting stain, I felt really angry to be honest. I felt sick and my skin was crawling. “It didn’t seem to smell but I wouldn’t say it had been through the wash at all.

Asked how it knew this, the spokesman replied: “Just by looking at it and smelling it. It was given to the cleaning team.” Ms Webber was unhappy with the hotel’s initial response to her complaint. She said: “As soon as I spoke to the manager at the front desk, she didn’t want to see my pictures. “The manager told me they couldn’t go in to check it because of Covid, as there’s a certain amount of time they had to wait. “I said, ‘I’m sorry but I’m not happy – this is unacceptable.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"mums mystery three day sickness","story":"NewsMums mystery three-day sickness is finally cured when spider crawls out of earEXCLUSIVE: Ros Wynne-Jones describes what happened when a water spider made its home in her ear in full gory details - its not for the squeamishShareCommentsByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnist:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsRos Wynne-Jones enjoying her Devon holiday - before the horrendous spider incident\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The ordeal ended abruptly three days later when a live spider casually crawled out of her ear.That led to a vomit-inducing hunt for aposeggs and legsapos the spider may have left behind inside her ear. Here Ros describes what happened in full gory detail but be warned - itaposs not for the squeamish, I’ve had the misfortune to go to casualty a few times in my le, but this week was the first time I’ve ever heard an AE triage nurse scream. I was wearing a facemask, having to shout through a Perspex . “I’ve got a bad ear-ache, and I feel really sick,” I said. So far, so good. “And a spider came out of my ear…” “OH GOD!” the nurse shouted. It was the first of many such reactions that I’ve heard since letting the world know about the experience. I’d been sent to AE by the  service to “check for eggs and legs” a sentence nobody wants to hear with regard to their ears. Luckily, neither were present, but the doctor didn’t look too keen as he gathered up his otoscope to peer inside. He diagnosed an ear infection, and labyrinthitis, the source of my nausea. My tweet on the subject went viral – setting off chains of horror stories of similar incidents involving spiders, eggs and sometimes moths, all over the globe. “Was that why Van Gogh cut his ear off ” one tweeter asked. This all started when I went wild swimming in a pond on my birthday last Monday while on holiday in Devon. It didn’t seem like a very dangerous activity – I’ve swum in Rwanda, survived the Sudanese and Kosovo wars, camped in the Australian bush and worked and travelled all over Africa and South America.  Afterwards, my ear was a bit clogged with water. The next day I felt really sick, which I put down to staying up late around the birthday campfire drinking rum. But three days later I still had nausea and my ear ached. On the Thursday, we went on a hilly car trip into Dartmoor, which altered the pressure in my ears. The result was almost indescribable. My ear started banging, cracking, whistling, and a feeling I can only describe as rustling. I stopped being able to communicate with anyone, let alone continue giving map directions. The nausea was horrendous. I got out of the car spinning, grabbing at my ear. At this point I felt something emerging from it... I assumed at first it was wax. But no. It was moving, and its legs were still kicking. It was a spider. Not a small spider but a thick-bodied spider.

So it’s understandable to have mixed feelings about the new normal, and be excited to see friends and family again but nervous too. According to a survey conducted with Very, worries about going back are outweighed by parents not wanting their children to fall behind on schoolwork. The Very Big Family Le Survey showed their biggest concern was how missing timetabled lessons has affected their progress.  This was particularly an issue for children preparing for secondary school –  per cent of parents with  and -year-olds said they were worried they’d fallen behind during lockdown. Not surprisingly, protecting their children and the rest of the family from the virus was also a factor. More than half of parents with kids and younger teens had concerns that social distancing wouldn’t be enforced, and two in three were anxious about them bringing it home. Despite that, with the added pressure of home schooling, the vast majority are relieved to be handing full-time teaching back to professionals. They’re also looking forward to everyone getting along better – more than  per cent thought kids being back at school would be good for their relationship. And they can take reassurance from parents who’ve already been through it. Those whose children have already gone back feel far more positive about it, with over three quarters saying their children are happier. Ian Young, principal of Rainford High School in Merseyside, says students and parents can feel confident schooling will remain unchanged. I think the main concerns are about school being safe and how lessons will be dferent because of new safety measures. Schools will let parents know what will be in place, and most will have a way for parents and students to ask questions beforehand. The benefits of ing should, he says, outweigh fears: Students will have the support and guidance of their teachers and become part of a community again. It’s also a chance to reconnect with friends and classmates, and consider some of the massive social changes we are in the midst of.For unorms, coats, shoes, bags and other back to school essentials go to Very."},{"url":null,"title":"one ten brits cant bothered","story":"NewsOne in ten Brits cant be bothered to make hair and beauty routine more sustainableA survey found Brits go through a lot of plastic from hair care and beauty products but not enough either want or know how to make it less harmful to the environmentShareCommentsByAstrid Hall:,  AUG NewsBrits are using too many plastic items for their hair care \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

A poll of , Brits revealed just how much plastic the average family is throwing out from their haircare regime - including shampoo, conditioner, hairspray and gel. A typical household will also go through  bottles of shower gel,  tubes of toothpaste,  bottles of moisturiser and  loo rolls each year. However, they only recycle an estimated  per cent of this plastic waste - leaving the rest to go to landfill - with a third of Brits admitting they donapost even consider the environmental impact of their haircare and beauty regime.

It also emerged that the average adult will shampoo their hair four times a week, and use conditioner three times - with men using more product to care for their hair than women.

The head of the school has also warned parents they should send their kids to Hogwarts - Harry Potteraposs school -they are not taking the coronavirus pandemic seriously. Only children in reception class will not be forced to cover their faces, according to the edict sent out by Warren Harrison, chief executive officer of the Premier Academyaposs Eaton Mill Primary School.In a newsletter sent to parents on Monday, Mr Harrison slammed the government for doing everything on the hoof and said the Premier Academy was acting with common sense, logic and reason in the face of coronavirus.All children in year one upwards whoto the school, in Bletchley, near Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, on September  will have to wear masks or visors. But the plan goes against government guidelines which state children under the age of  do not have to wear masks. The newsletter - which was signed off with Stay safe, mask up and stay classy, states: All staff, children, parents, carers and visitors must don a mask when on site or they will not be allowed access. Face coverings are not acceptable. We recommend the N or surgical masks. Once in their bubbles, children and those members of staff in close contact with children will change from a mask to a named shield which will be supplied by the school. Anyone may however stay in a maskthey prefer. Reception aged children will not be mandated to wear a mask or face shield, however we would encourage you to encourage them to do so at the current time. When moving around the school, masks or shields must be worn - e.g visiting the toilets. When not in the classroom, masks may be removed for eating purposes and when outside the building during the bubbleaposs daily walks. All cross bubble contact between children and staff and staff and staff will need all parties to don a mask. At dismissal time all shields should be left on desks with water bottles so that they can be cleaned efficiently. Children will be dismissed in masks to adults wearing masks. It went on to ask everyone to try and maintain a m distance and said face shields would be named and provided by the school. It went on: Make sure that your child understands why they are wearing a mask.  Teach them how to apply it and remove it and slip their arm through it up to their bicep for when they go to the dining hall or their daily walks. It would also be usefulthey could practise wearing a shield over their face for a while at home to get them used to this too. Please note that the following steps are precautionary measures designed to protect everyone from C- and especially the more vulnerable members of staff. These measures will be reviewed monthly however we expect more schools to follow suit. The school is also cancelling breakfast and after school clubs. And Mr Harrison went on to criticise the way the government had handled its response to the pandemic. He said: If it goes well, you never know, it may catch on. From what we have witnessed so far, doing everything on the hoof doesnapost really pay idends. Especially given the fact that government is now scapegoating Public Health England which will be disbanded by Hancock who actually has direct control of PHE and is the same man who told NHS workers back in April that wearing masks made no dference. If this sounds too far fetched then please avoid talking to -year-olds about their exam results. Yesterday students protesting in London were demanding that the Prime Minister came out of hiding. Today a national newspaper has reported that he has gone on another holiday.  Maybe he is thinking thatthings donapost improve, he can replace Dion Dublin on A Place In The Sun. Who knows  The WHO has said from the outset that we need to test, test, test and this would seem like the obvious way forward which would solve many of the issues and help reduce anxiety. If we could we would like to randomly test children and staff on a weekly basis and we do not understand why this is such a dficult strategy for the government to deliver on unless of course it knows something that we donapost. Just like a vesper martini it would shake things up without stirring things up especially today which is so far the day when the highest number of C- cases have been confirmed globally. Mr Harrisonaposs letter is titled aposThe World Has Changed And So Have Weapos and also makes puns about Bond movies. It states: Although this may sound like the title of the next Bond Movie, it is not. I do appreciate that it could have felt like the sky was falling in recently but tomorrow never dies and we have to look to the future. The quantum of solace that we have all faced recently seemed to be coming to an end until today when MK Council leader Pete Marland said that MK may soon need to go into lockdown! As it stands we are still planning to open on  September and to have all children back on site by the end of that week. There is no way of working Moonraker into this paragraph, howeverthe next Bond movie is set in SW, I expect the title to be From Punch And Judy With Love!

With cancer, you really can’t afford to neglect your body - your very own vessel to take you through this one and only le. We read things all the time about what to be aware of and sometimes it might become monotonous, to the point that you might stop taking notice. But it is so important. In all honesty, I wasn’t very good at checking before my diagnosis. I just always thought aposnahhh I’m only youngapos. In fact cancer very rarely crossed my mind. It probably doesn’t for a lot of you either, or perhaps you’re scared to think the worst  Do you talk to your children about cancer  About signs and symptoms  My six year old Ivy is pretty relaxed mentioning the C word at home and cancer is no longer a ‘whispered word’ in our house. Our children should be aware of changes and comfortable enough to talk about them with someone. I think we also really need to be taking more notice of changes in our inidual selves. What is your normal  So many people think that checking for a lump is enough - but there are sooooo many other symptoms of cancer and with Covid- plunging the world of cancer into turmoil, now is the time you should be more in control of yourself than ever before. The most important thing I will always say to people is to ‘be your own advocate’. Don’t rely on someone to make all the decisions and hope for the best. If something doesn’t feel right, go to your GP, pester them time and againyou have to. I always think, they won’t lose any sleep over you being OTT, but you will. Obviously, use your common sense - we know the NHS is snowed under but this is your le and really, it’s in your hands, no-one aposs. So check yourself, your boobs and your balls for lumps and bumps and your poo for traces of blood. Accept that screening letter, don’t miss your smear. Received a poo sample in the post  Get it done. With the massive plummet in cancer referrals due to Covid-, Cancer Research UK reported that urgent referrals dropped to around  percent of usual levels in England at the start of the pandemic but have since started to rebound, with figures at around % of usual levels in recent weeks. But for each week referrals stay below  percent, the number of cancer cases that are going undiagnosed will continue to stack up.  We really need to get the message out there that the NHS is still there for you when you need them…please don’t assume that you will be fineyou just ‘hang on a little longer until Covid goes away’. The message is loud and clear ‘early detection can give protection’. If found early, most cancers are curable.

A photograph of the supposed ghostly apparition at the Birmingham building site has left many scratching their heads over whether it is genuine or a hoax. The eerie image baffled security bosses at the site on Sherborne Street after the aposmovementapos triggered motion cameras in the early hours of Tuesday, August . The vision is claimed to have been picked up by CCTV in the dead of night - but when security performed a full patrol of the area just minutes later they found it all clear. The security boss at the site said he struggled to go back to sleep as he was so creeped out by the apparition of the woman, who appears to be wearing a dress and carrying an object as she walks through the site in the cityaposs centre.Security staff were alerted after a motion sensor camera picked up movement and snapped the sinister image, reports Birmingham Live. Adam Lees, managing director of Limitless Security, said: We provide security for the building site on Sherborne Street, in Birmingham city centre. In the early hours of Tuesday we had an alert to say a motion-sensored camera had picked up movement on the site. The images come through to my laptop, so I checked and saw that picture. I notied security on site straightaway who did a full patrol but found nothing. Itaposs incredibly strange. I have no idea what it could have been but I didnapost sleep the rest of the night. The alert was raised at .am on August . Three minutes later, on-site security responded and carried out a full patrol, finding the site all-clear. Mr Lees said: They went out straightaway, it was within minutes and there was no sign of anybody there or of anybody ever being there - it was really bizarre. I have no idea what it could have been but I didnapost sleep the rest of the night and it gave me the shivers thataposs for sure. Iaposve never believed in ghosts but I canapost explain this. People have been saying its take but I can assure them it is  per cent genuine. I wish it wasnapost, as it has properly given me the creeps. Iaposve never seen anything like it before. Sheaposs leaning forward and seems to be floating, and is holding something in her hands. To me it looks like sheaposs wearing a wedding dress like sheaposs waiting to get married. She looks like a ghostly bride. Itaposs the strangest thing Iaposve seen in five years of looking after hundreds of sites like this. Imagine looking at this image when youaposve been woken up at two in the morning and are half asleep. It took my a while to drop off again after that. I did a bit of research to seethere had been any churches on the street. All I found was that itaposs a really old street thataposs been there hundreds of years.The image has been shared thousands of times since it was posted by _Meglittle on Twitter.She wrote: So my dadaposs building site in Birmingham has a CCTV camera alert that flashes when thereaposs movement and this morning it took this photo. Ten minutes later security went to check and found NOTHING. Some Twitter users were astonished by the picture. One user commented: If this is real that is proper creepy. Ghosts just walking around... makes you wonder. And another added: What the hell, wish I never saw this.

The list of exempt nations where Brits donapost have to self-isolate after visiting is under weekly review, with an announcement expected tonight. Following the spike in cases across ious popular destinations, holidaymakers should keep a close eye on their travel plans. Thousands of travellers have already ed this year to find that they have to self-isolate for  days.

It was naivety and the wrong decision at that time to leave.”Championship-winning defender Dave Rogers says departing Dundee in  for Ayr United was one of his biggest regrets of his career.The bubbly Scouser arrived at Dens Park ahead of the   season and played  times as the Dark Blues won promotion back to the big time and lted the First Division trophy.He would leave the following year, however, after an injury-hit campaign in the top flight.And the former centre-back revealed to the Walking Down The Provie Road podcast that the decision to join the Honest Men was a poor one.Rogers said: “I was offered a new contract by Dundee but I was misinformed and badly advised to go back and sign for Ayr United. I take a lot of blame myself as well.“But when I look back, it was the biggest mistake because I loved the city, loved the fans. It was naivety and the wrong decision at that time to leave.“Ayr wanted to make me captain, be their leader and get promoted, like Dundee just got promoted.“There was talk of a new stadium so there was a three-year contract with this leadership role and ambitions to get up but I was very naïve.“I listened to the wrong information and in hindsight it turned out to be the wrong decision. I don’t blame anybody, I take responsibility.”Now head coach at an ambitious American side FC Arizona, Rogers would only play  times for Ayr in Division One before a spell on loan at Partick Thistle in Division Two followed.The former Everton kid would go on to have a successful time in Ireland, winning three league titles with Shelbourne.But it’s his time at Dens Park as a -year-old he looks back on with most fondness.He said: “You’d be driving and stop at traffic lights and hear a horn go. It would be Dundee fans, showing their tattoos and everything. I love that. That’s passion. Genuine fans.“It was so rewarding to win the First Division that season and I’ll never forget the following we had at Raith Rovers that day. That’s why Dundee is still in my heart and always will be.“I look back on it and it was the best decision I made . What a squad of players and what a club to come and play for.”Described as a Dundee cult hero in some quarters, Rogers rejects that tag, saying there are more deserving ‘heroes’ for fans at Dens Park.“I’m a modest guy, I’m no cult hero for Dundee,” he added.“Bobby Cox was a legend and a hero. I remember when I signed the great man came along to training one day. Bobby came over to shake my hand and it sticks with me.“He said ‘Scouse! Welcome to the club, mate, great to have you!’ then he added ‘but you’ll never have a left foot as good as mine!’“To hear that from an actual legend, to make me feel welcome the way he did and the way everyone did, it’ll live with me forever.”And seeing the fans flock to Stark’s Park on April , , where Dundee only needed a point to clinch the First Division title with four games to spare, was one of Rogers’ best recollections in a memorable time at Dens Park.“We knew we had a squad of players capable of winning the league,” he added.“We knew the expectations, the fans and the club needed to be back in the Premier League. We knew we had what it took but we never let ourselves get carried away.“We got to Raith Rovers and only needed a point – I think the celebrations went on for four days after that! It was phenomenal and great memories.“We saw the support that day and were thinking to ourselves ‘let’s put it to bed, do it today’ after seeing the support behind the goal.“We got the point and sent everybody back over the Tay Bridge celebrating. It was an unbelievable experience.”Rogers found the net just once in his time in dark blue but he admits the penalty to win against Airdrie in October proved costly – and not just because he did his hamstring.“There was a little bit of rivalry between Airdrie and ourselves.“We got the penalty in the rd minute, I slotted it in and went running round the dog track towards all the fans and my hamstring went!“To kill a bit of time, Cowboytook me off. Walking past their bench, there was a bit of mouthing and me, being a Scouser, mouthed back at them.“In the altercation, I tripped over by accident and after the game I naively said Big Doddystuck his leg out and tried to trip me up.“It was tongue-in-cheek but the next day I’m all over the back of the newspapers! Alex McDonald was brilliant, he accepted my apology.“It was a lesson learned – keep the mouth shut next time and you won’t be fined four weeks wages!”Despite a change of manager from McCormack to Jocky Scott, the camaraderie among the players that season drove the club on.Rogers said: “The team spirit was phenomenal. It’s the best club, the best team spirit and the best squad of players I’ve ever been involved with.“I’ll never forget when big Rab Douglas signed – I thought we’d signed Ivan Drago from Rocky!“Rab was a phenomenal goalkeeper, his shot-stopping was amazing and to have a presence like that behind you as a defender is a relief at times.“You knowyou are under the cosh, the big fella was there.“You had Barry Smith, a great leader, and Brian Irvine at the back, Maddygetting up and down the left and not to forget the Cobra, the mad fellaAdamczuk would catch pigeons up and down the right-hand side.“Then there was Iain Anderson, a game-changer, Darren Magee in midfield with Jimmy McInally and Eddie Annand. We had a quality squad.”Now a highly-qualied coach, Rogers has travelled the globe since his playing days ended in , having coached in the Liverpool International Football Academy in Europe, India and South Korea as well as being assistant manager to the Indian national side.Now in Arizona, the -year-old is keen to continue learning his trade and has ambitions to manage back in the UK.Asked whether that might be at Dundee, Rogers replied: “Never say never! The manager James McPake is doing a great job and I hope the fans get behind him.“It’s tough times and like what happened with Barry Smith, I know the fans will get behind him.“One day I do have aspirations of being manager at highest level.“Would I love to come back to Scotland or the UK as a manager  Absolutely, but only for the right club.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

In his first season as manager at Dens Park, James McPake had absolutely no qualms about throwing in talented youngsters.It helped he’d coached the U s previously and knew just how good these players were before he stepped up to the big job.AndFin Robertson isn’t a poster boy for how good a young Dundonian footballer can be, I don’t know who is.Robertson was joined last season by Lyall Cameron, Callum Moore and Josh Mulligan in getting some first-team action.With budgets tightened for bringing in new experienced faces, the opportunity is sitting there for these boys to seize a regular spot in the starting XI.The quality coming through also shows why academy chiefs at Dens are working so hard right now to maintain as much of the existing structure as they can, despite the financial hit caused by the shutdown.Across the road, too, we’ve seen Micky Mellon utilise the young players at Dundee United – Logan Chalmers, Lewis Neilson and Kieran Freeman have all had decent game time. And, in his own words, the Tannadice gaffer plans to unleash even more.I expected the Tangerines to be flexing their muscles in the transfer market this summer on theirto the top flight.Obviously, the pandemic and the drop in finances has seen them change that plan.And who benefits  The players that fans want to see more than anything – one of their own getting a chance.I really hope out of this disaster of a year, for just about everybody in the world, we can see young players in this city benefit from greater opportunity.We’ll have to wait and see for Dundee when they get going again in seven weeks but there are a few additional names we might see get a go next term – Sam Fisher, Luke Strachan and possibly Calum Ferrie.Who knows, this season could make Dundee the City of Discovery for the next generation of young players.I don’t expect this weekend’s clash with champions Celtic to teach us much we don’t already know about this Dundee United side.The Hoops are the big favourites to retain their title again and I can’t see anyone getting near them.For Micky Mellon and his Tangerines, though, they’ll no doubt see it as a chance to teach the likes of me something new – that they can go and mix it with the best in this country.That’s the overall aim after all.Neil Lennon’s men will be well rested after their enforced break but there might be some cobwebs having grown thanks to Boli Bolingoli’s wee holiday to Spain.And United are full of confidence right now, they’ll be eager to put on a good display.A promoted team against the reigning champions, though, it’s a free hit for United – especially after the start they’ve made.Meanwhile, QPR’s reported £ million bid for Lyndon Dykes should be music to the ears of United –he’s worth that, Lawrence Shankland is worth double at least.I’ve still not recovered from the shock of seeing QPR willing to shell out that amount of money to sign Dykes from Livingston.I can’t believe it’s the same player I, and every other Doonhamer at Palmerston, used to moan and groan about every week.To be fair, we have missed him and Stephen Dobbie has toiled without him up top at Queen of the South.Good luck to him down south but, for me, it’s a massive gamble for QPR.Man United’s Europa League demise was tough to watch. Not only because they were the better team but because the goals lost were dreadful. Much of the team were out on their feet but there were no subs to change the game.#That#s the size of the club# Dundee United manager Micky Mellon expects his team to pick up wins on the road despite having only just ed to the Premiership\" title\"##That#s the size of the club# Dundee United manager Micky Mellon expects his team to pick up wins on the road despite having only just ed to the Premiership# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-micky-mellon-ross-county embed # secretMjbYGYW\" data-secret\"MjbYGYW\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

So many people are intimidated by other vehicles. The Bikeability scheme gives children and adults the confidence to ride out safely.#The training, over three days, and was a mixture of games, exercises and on road practice, finishing with an assessment. The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe. The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges. P  pupils Ross Potter-Irwin and Henry Small should get their Bikeability badges in term time next year.Through partnership with the Ardrishaig Bothy, Cycling Scotland is offering schools free instructor support, instructor training and resources to deliver Bikeability Scotland training.Bikeability Scotland is the national cycle training programme designed to give children the skills and confidence they need to cycle safely on the roads and to encourage them to carry on cycling into adulthood.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything .

This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Young people across Scotland could be in line for as much as pound free from the Government for starting a new job, thanks to a new benefit.Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:Income-based Jobseekerrsquos AllowanceIncome SupportIncome-related Employment and Support AllowanceUniversal CreditWhat has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

cases that are occurring because pupils are catching the virus in the school setting, they are cases that are arising in the community, and when we have the virus circulating in the community even at low levels we know that children and young people may get it and then thereforethey go into the school they are still carrying it.She added: ldquoI thinkwe wanted to talk about, for example, face

Fraser McAllister hit out at their ldquoillogical recommendation which,approved by councillors at an online meeting next week, would grant permission for a restaurant to be created in the car park of the Tesco store off Olivebank Road.He claimed that the drive-thru, which would operate  hours a day, seven days a week, would be ldquonext to the most congested roundabout in the county.The former SNP councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale. The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles.

To add to the magic, we saw dolphins as we approached the ruins.There is actually little left of the castle itself: small chunks of masonry jutting out like broken teeth are the only obvious evidence to the existence of the clf-top fortress.But itrsquos the location, and the stories attached to it, which tingle the spine.Itrsquos a steep descent to it, and care needs to be taken as you near the castle, for the path veers dangerously close to the edge of the clfs.We took it gradually, with a distant view of the ruins enticing us. A solid cement walkway now links the promontory to the mainland, where once a drawbridge gave access to the castle. The kids crossed it, one by one, with help from me and my we Kate. Itrsquos at this point, as you enter the historic remains, that the power of the location is truly revealed.Itrsquos like walking into lsquothe godsrsquo of a giant natural amphitheatre, with clfs looming on both sides, and sheer drops below. The sound of the open sea and gulls swamp your senses, and I was thankful we had visited when it was calm, for I can imagine a visit on a windy day would give the precipitous edges an almost terrying character. We settled down for our picnic where once the great hall stood, with breathtaking views.Whenever I visit such places, itrsquos not just what is seen that inspires me itrsquos the stories of the place. Here the ghosts of the past wait to tell you their tale,you have an ear to listen. And what tales are sewn onto this rocky top!The castle gets its first mention in the early s, but for sure human habitation predates that. In , the English captured it and it remained in English hands for the rest of that century a stone in the shoe of south-east Scotland. It was finally retaken in  by the forces of Patrick Dunbar but later it became a rebuilt stronghold of the Home family.History records that they hosted the young princess Margaret Tudor here in  as she headed north to become Scotlandrsquos queen, with her marriage to James IV and thus change the destiny of both countries.She will have shared the views we had while we ate our picnic, although I suspect her banquet may have been a little more indulgent. Who can say what impressions this wild view gave her of her new homeland.Her granddaughter, Mary Queen of Scots, would visit the castle  years later in , in what for her was a very turbulent time.How I wished the few stones of the castle that still stood could tell a story of these remarkable women, who had to navigate their royal privilege through misogynist contempt.After being abandoned, the castlersquos windswept ruins were the haunt of smugglers and wreckers, who would set a light amongst the old stones, making it look like a welcoming port.But it was the story of Madge Gordon that was foremost in my mind as I sat amongst the ruins of the castle that, according to the tale, she helped liberate from the English.The story is called the lsquoGuid We of Coldinghamrsquo and it is to be found in Wilsonrsquos Tales of the Borders. These were a fantastic collection of stories written by John Mackay Wilson in the early th century. Today, the Wilsonrsquos Tales Project promotes his work, which was prodigious.It is a tale set in the grim times of the Rough Wooing in the s, when English forces were using force and terror to persuade the Scots to agree to the marriage of the young Mary Queen of Scots to Edward Tudor.Madge was a widow with an abiding hatred of the English occupiers, who had killed her husband. Her daughter Janet was in love with a young man called Florence, but Madge would only agree to their marriagethe young man showed his loyalty and mettle by helping her to take Fast Castle, which had been occupied by English forces.This he agreed to do, and raised a force of over a hundred local people. Madge hatched a plan to attack the castle, but both she and Florence kept it secret from Janet. She feared for her loversquos le, and felt strongly that war was pointless for it mattered not who occupied the castle as the poor folk would be oppressed either way.Madge led the attack, entering the castle in the guise of being a seller of local produce, then plunging her husbandrsquos sword into a guard. The ensuing fight was short and brutal. The young Florence fought bravely and the castle was won.After this, Madge proudly agreed that the brave Florence was worthy of her daughterrsquos hand in marriage. Janet, who had heard the commotion of the fight and rushed to the scene, desperately looked for her Florence.When she saw he was alive, she rushed joyfully to him and held him in a tight embrace. He held her likewise, saying her name ldquoJanet.But this was to be his last word spoken, for his hold on her began to weaken and his legs gave way. He had been mortally wounded in the fight. Janet screamed for help and he was carried into a room in the castle, where frantic attempts to revive him were made but he was gone.Janet plunged into inconsolable grief. She blamed her mother, and the unbearable loss sent her to the grave only two years later. Her mother followed the year after, and all three rest in Coldingham kirkyard.ldquoWhat a sad story, my we said after I had finished telling it. ldquoIs it true ldquoMaybe not in the sense you mean, I said, ldquobut it is a story with real truth: how war spawns hatred and loss, and as Janet said, the poor folk lose out whoever rules the castle.On such a sunny day, it was dficult to leave this beautul place, but the kids wanted a swim and the sun was already lowering in the sky.The walk back is a hard slog up the brae, but it gives moments to rest and catch your breath while turning to view the ruins.Here, surrounded by millions of years of geology, with the view of the tumbled remains of a castle in which lives now long forgotten were lived, a whisper is heard in the wind.ldquoWhatever your woes, whatever your joys, yours is a tiny speck in time, so use it wisely and with gratitude.On that day, I think we did just that."},{"url":null,"title":"ormiston-couple-jenny-harry-runciman-toast-70th-wedding-anniversary","story":"Jenny and Harry Runciman celebrated their th wedding anniversary at their home on George Crescent.The couple married in Pencaitland Parish Church on August , .

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit, literally. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:What has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

In addition, discussions are ongoing with local bike shop businesses as to how they can support the public hire scheme.Public Bike Shareschemes have been introduced across the world, with many using docks which lock the bicycles in and release them for a small fee or with use of a card to users however, their success in the UK has been limited, with vandalism a major concern.In London, Santander Cycles operates a successful scheme which has spread to Swansea and Milton Keynes, with users issued a key to access the bicycles, which cost pound and allow free use for the first  minutes and then charge pound for every additional  minutes.East Lothian Council said that as well as Musselburgh, there were plans to have public hire stations for e-bikes in Haddington town centre and at Prestonpans Railway Station, Longniddry Railway Station, Memorial Square in Prestonpans, Civic Square in Tranent and Memorial Park in Cockenzie, each of which would have capacity for eight bikes.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskill described the changes as ldquoreclaiming the streets.He said: ldquoThis is a challenge but equally an opportunity, offering other public health improvements, as well as the required social distancing. Reducing air pollution and promoting walking and cycling will have benefits for us all. Providing adequate car parking remains essential, with vehicular access understandably restricted. Itrsquos not easy but it can be done. As communities on the continent have discovered, people reclaiming their streets has benefits for all.Iain Gray, East Lothian MSP, said: ldquoThe substantial increase in the number of people walking and cycling, both locally and across the UK, was one of the positive unintended consequences of lockdown.ldquoThis clearly brings benefits for both the health of the iniduals doing more walking and cycling, and for the environmentit means fewer vehicles on our roads.ldquoTherefore, I welcome measures to encourage and support the continuation of this growth in walking and cycling as we move out of lockdown.ldquoHowever, changes must be designed and implemented with ongoing consultation with the local communities affected.In a report to councillors, Peter Forsyth, the councilrsquos assets manager, revealed ambitions to make the most of the side effects of lockdown.He said: ldquoThe Covid- shutdown has resulted in less air pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions primarily due to extensive travel restrictions. Other positive impacts have included reduced energy consumption, and increased walking and cycling. Accordingly, there are opportunities for a lsquoGreen Recoveryrsquo, adapting to new ways of working with increased changes to travel behaviour all in support to the transition to a low carbon economy and low carbon lestyles for the longer term that will enable us to continue to tackle the climate emergency.A council spokesperson said: ldquoAs part of Spaces for People, we are proposing the installation of e-bikes in suitable locations. E-bikes are becoming increasingly popular as an active travel option which could be potentially attractive as an alternative form of clean, green transportation. We are still at the early stages and look forward to pursuing this further and will provide further information in due course."},{"url":null,"title":"petition-museum-flight-plans-signed-nearly-6-500","story":"The new visitor centre for the National Museum of Flight at East Fortune was refused planning permission by East Lothian Council after it involved cutting down the trees in an ancient woodland to allow planes to be moved into it.National Museums Scotland has lodged an appeal over the rejection of its plans with Scottish Ministers.It said the tree removal was required to ldquodecant large fixed-wing aircraft from their current home to the new indoor exhibition centre, and saplings would be planted to replace the lost woodland.However, objectors argued that an alternative site could still be found and the need to protect the woodland far outweighed the need for the new centre.More than  written objections have been lodged with the Scottish Government Reporter as part of the appeal however, an online petition was rejected initially because it was said to be the wrong format.That decision has now been overruled by the Reporter, who has allowed the petition, which has , names on it, to be included in evidence.Alerting National Museums Scotland and East Lothian Council to the decision, case officer Laura Walker said: ldquoAn external link webpage was sent to myself back in June.

Question : who said: ldquoI am not a postcode ndash was it a pupils in Scotland or b pupils in England  Question : who said ldquoI should not be punished because I live in a deprived area ndash was it a pupils in Scotland or b pupils in England And finally, our third bonus round is about apologies. Question : who said: ldquoI am sorry  Was it a Gavin Williamson or b John Swinney  Question : who said: ldquoI would like to apologise to all those young people whorsquove been affected by this. Was it a Gavin Williamson or b John Swinney You get where Irsquom going with this, donrsquot you  The answer to all the questions is: it doesnrsquot matter because they are interchangeable. On the question of the initial results, both Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson defended them at first. Ms Sturgeon said they were ldquocredible Mr Johnson said they were ldquorobust.This was then followed by remarkably similar protests from pupils. In Scotland, they held up placards that said ldquoI am not a postcode. In England they held up placards that said ldquoI am not a postcode.Then came the apologies. Mr Swinney said: ldquoWe now accept that the risk of undermining the value of qualications is outweighed by a concern that young people, particularly from working class backgrounds, may lose faith in education. Mr Williamson said: ldquoIt became increasingly apparent that there were too many young people that quite simply hadnt got the grade they truly deserved.\"Some people say the two situations are dferent they say the UK Government should have seen what was coming because of the fiasco in Scotland and I understand that to an extent. But to suggest that the Scottish Government handled the situation well and the UK Governmentrsquos approach was chaos is misleading. Look at the trajectories Irsquove outlined above: theyrsquore the same.The dference is our reaction. When the fiasco first hit in England and the Tories stood by the exam results, I was texted by a colleague of mine who insisted on voting Yes in  despite me telling him not to. His text contrasted the responses of the Tories and the SNP. The SNP, he said, admitted they screwed up, whereas the Tories dug their heels in. There was similar reaction on Twitter: ldquoat least the SNP had the grace to accept they were wrong and apologise.So when the Tories also apologised I texted my colleague back. Presumably, I asked him pompously, you now have the same respect for the Tory U-turn as you had for the SNP one  ldquoBetter late than never, he replied. ldquoBut they dragged their feet for days hellip and its yet another U-turn. They are very good at them, arent they I know a lot of you will agree with my colleague, but itrsquos me whorsquos writing this column, not him, so I get the last word and itrsquos this: the Tory apology in England reveals how biased we are in Scotland. If we trust someone ndash and a lot of people in Scotland trust the SNP ndashwersquore willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and accept their apology. Equally,we do not like someone ndash and a lot of people in Scotland do not like the Tories ndash wersquore more likely to judge them and dismiss their apology as too little too late.The word for all of this is bias and thatrsquos fine in a way because wersquore all guilty of it ndash we are all more likely to react to people rather than facts. But bias operates even when the facts are the same: I refer you the facts outlined above ndash they are the same. Some people may say the bias towards the SNP is well founded: theyrsquove governed Scotland well. They may also say the bias against the Tories is well-founded: look at their record. But perhaps it would helpwe all accepted that our reaction to political events is rarely objective. Itrsquos skewed. Itrsquos biased.

Once children are born, cohabiting parents are almost four times more likely to separate before a child is five than married parents. The health and educational attainment of children with broken family backgrounds are worse, and their likelihood of having a criminal conviction by the age of  doublestheir parents separated before they were five.These statistics certainly cast matrimony in a starkly black and white light.

Butmarriage truly is the key factor in this downward trajectory,a set of vows and a certicate and a wedding video is the glue that holds the middle classes together, then that is a whole other issue. Suddenly a custom that previously was prevalent across the classes is in danger of becoming a status symbol. Marriage, by this calculation, is synonymous with money.I grew up in the wake of the Beatles and the moon landing, when walking down the aisle was no longer essential, evenyou hoped to have children. Nevertheless the stigma of cohabiting, or becoming parents before you wore a wedding ring, took a long time to fade.

Cohabiting was no more a byword for casual than marrying was for happy. Yet now, it is deemed a red flag for social disadvantage.The direct correlation between marriage and class suggests that money is at least part of the explanation.

And the more it is perceived to be for the better off, the less it will appeal to people further down the social spectrum.You canrsquot help wonderingthe wedding industry, as opposed to marriage itself, has created expectations that the hard-up simply cannot meet. With the average Scottish wedding now costing over a staggering pound,, this comes as no surprise. Increasingly the concept of marrying is bound up with the wedding.

Not to mention stag and hen weekends and parties beforehand.It takes at least a year, and usually a lot longer, to book, plan and save for the big day. Ultimately, though, what matters is not the trappings, but making the vows, whether in a religious setting, or a registry office.

Perhaps it is time to separate the legal procedure from the carnival that follows, to consciously uncouple the act of union from this crippling cost.Yet the nub of the problem identied by CSJ is not marriage itself, but hardship. Those living on the bread line do not have the resources, and possibly donrsquot have the inclination, to get officially tied. Given the serious disadvantages suffered when they separate, the answer, surely, is not to coax iniduals into wedlock, asit were the panacea for all their ails, but to digny cohabiting couples and their offspring with the same legal safeguards and tax breaks as those who marry. Protecting the rights of children and parents ndash especially mothers, who commonly look after the kids once a relationship ends ndash would give them a financial safety-net. Many of the outcomes for youngsters described in this report ndash gang membership, criminality, mental and physical health issues ndash are as much the result of penury as the lack of a piece of paper supposedly binding their parents forever.If it is to retain its meaning, marriage has to be a personal choice, not a virtuous act that deserves a reward. It can be done cheaply and quietly, as I can testy, or with terric fanfare, or it can be avoided altogether. Either way, in an enlightened world those in long-term relationships, and couples with children, should be treated by government in exactly the same way as the married. Until that day ndash far off, I fear ndash the gulf between the haves and the have nots will steadily deepen, eroded by a judgemental, moralising and, as wersquove too often seen, hypocritical state.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Given the serious disadvantages suffered when they separate, the answer, surely, is not to coax iniduals into wedlock, asit were the panacea for all their ails, but to digny cohabiting couples and their offspring with the same legal safeguards and tax breaks as those who marry. Protecting the rights of children and parents ndash especially mothers, who commonly look after the kids once a relationship ends ndash would give them a financial safety-net. Many of the outcomes for youngsters described in this report ndash gang membership, criminality, mental and physical health issues ndash are as much the result of penury as the lack of a piece of paper supposedly binding their parents forever.If it is to retain its meaning, marriage has to be a personal choice, not a virtuous act that deserves a reward. It can be done cheaply and quietly, as I can testy, or with terric fanfare, or it can be avoided altogether. Either way, in an enlightened world those in long-term relationships, and couples with children, should be treated by government in exactly the same way as the married. Until that day ndash far off, I fear ndash the gulf between the haves and the have nots will steadily deepen, eroded by a judgemental, moralising and, as wersquove too often seen, hypocritical state.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The problem was that the script got messed up in the middle of the project. The pesky jury, which had a majority of women, had undermined their plan by daring to find Mr Salmond not guilty. Never mind, get the script back on track and show that he was really guilty anyway and how terribly the poor complainants have been treated. Ignore the women who appeared for the defence, ignore the women on the jury. They are the wrong kind of women and, of course, men are never allowed to be victims. One set of crude stereotypes has been replaced by another set of crude stereotypes.The complainants are all mature professional women used to the rough trade of politics. That is in the public domain from information presented in the courtroom. They are not vulnerable girls. Anonymity is fine in the courtroom but when you have been found not to be credible yet continue to make claims outside of court, is it natural justice still to have that privilege  The former accused who has been found not guilty does not have any protection.For the BBC and the production company to try to cover their back by claiming that Mr Salmond was given the opportunity to be interviewed is cheap and dishonest. He is due shortly to appear before a parliamentary committee under oath and will present a substantial report. Is the BBC really suggesting that submitting to a few hostile questions in a loaded documentary is a fitting balance I can speak as someone who has over many years agreed and disagreed with Mr Salmond. He never quite fitted into \"establishment\" Scotland. They sensed that he was a potential disrupter. Sometimes he would play ball with them but he lacked true deference. They really hoped that the trial would nail down the coffin but he escaped, and several dferent cliques are trying to get him back into the cemetery. I dont know how much they should bet on it.Isobel Lindsay, Biggar.I AM a firm believer in independence for Scotland.I do not put great storage in personalities but nevertheless think the SNP has enjoyed excellent leadership over the last  years.It was from this basis I watched the Kirsty Wark programme on the Alex Salmond trial.To say I was shocked by this programme is an understatement. Not only did Ms Wark seek, in my view, to undermine the verdict of the trial, but in doing so she also chose to put a bomb under the whole system of justice. Why the BBC allowed this to happen is astounding.The basis of justice is that anyone is innocent until proven guilty. A jury did not accept any proof of guilt in this case and therefore Mr Salmond is innocent. This programme set about to destroy the conclusion reached by the jury. There was no attempt at fairness in the programme. The scenes of hands being wrung, the tones of the actors speaking for the women, the omission of most of the defence, the summing up by Ms Wark, these were all played out to condemn as guilty a man already found innocent.I am left asking myself why was this programme ever made. Was it to destroy a man  Was it to hurt the cause of the SNP and independence  Was the public interest being served I am unsure what the consequences of the programme will be. I do, however, contemplate the terrying prospect for those on trial is that it in future it may not be sufficient for a jury to find you innocent but that Kirsty Wark and the BBC come to the same verdict.George Kay, Burntisland.MUCH of the Kirsty Wark programme about the Alex Salmond trial was taken up with material which was already in the public domain and was therefore fairly unremarkable. However, there is one part that cannot go uncommented upon.Kenny MacAskill made unambiguous accusations that a conspiracy had taken place involving the women witnesses and senior members of their own party, the SNP. Mr MacAskills statement was especially noteworthy as he is both a sitting SNP MP and more importantly, a former Scottish Government Justice Secretary. As such he is fully aware of the gravity of the allegations that he is making: that the witnesses and the SNP leadership conspired to incriminate Mr Salmond on charges which would have deprived him of his liberty, and that the women perjured themselves to bring about that same aim. Mr MacAskill assured Ms Wark that he had evidence of these allegations from a number of sources.It is essential that these allegations are investigated as a matter of urgency by the Crown authorities, andthey are found to be of substance, the alleged perpetrators must be charged and put on trial accordingly. Conversely,Mr MacAskill is found to have made serious allegations for which there are no grounds, then it is he who should face the consequences.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.HAVING watched the BBC programme fronted by Kirsty Wark, The Trial of Alex Salmond, there can be little doubt that the judgment of the jury in finding him not guilty of  charges of attempted rape, sexual assault and indecent assault, with one charge of sexual assault with intent to rape not proven, was indeed the correct one.Of course, as the law stands at the moment, there was no criminality. However what Mr Salmond is guilty of, surely, not least as a married man, is that by his drunken behaviour on occasion, and his disgraceful and dishonourable manner toward a number of female colleagues in places such as Bute House, he brought the very privileged position and high office of First Minister into disrepute, and for that alone, he should now apologise unreservedly to the people of Scotland.Neil McKinnon, Perth.SOME time back in the immediate aftermath of the failed independence referendum I decided to join the SNP, so went to a meeting of the local branch. Metaphorically speaking I had the piano-wire looked out and identied handy lampposts, I was ready to rock. After sitting through an hour of a badly-chaired meeting where dfering cliques argued about who should go to national meetings and other trivia I gave up I made a few pointed remarks and left so angry and disappointed that I left my good woolly hat behind as I stormed out in a huff. I had hoped for better but assumed the behaviour at the meeting was not representative of the SNP as an organisation.However, yet again Irsquom informed by your reportage that Government ministers as well as civil servants continue to refuse to ulge potentially germane information to the relevant body in an inquiry related to what appears to the outsider to contain an element of internal power struggles within the SNP . I find this behaviour impossible to reconcile with democratic governance.The SNP USP is that Westminster is alien to us Scots, itrsquos ldquotheir government and Holyrood is ldquoour government. As long as ministers and civil servants deliberately withhold information from the general public they are not ldquomy government as I canrsquot trust them as it makes them look just like Westminster. Again, to the outsider it appears that the SNP establishment is risking prejudicing the cause for Scottish independence in order to save the reputation of just who, and why David J Crawford, Glasgow G.AT the Scottish Parliamentrsquos inquiry into the conduct of the Alex Salmond case, three committee members wished the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, to answer a question about whether a protocol existed concerning whether female civil servants should be left alone with Alex Salmond ndash as was alleged at Mr Salmondrsquos trial. Ms Evans had said \"I canrsquot comment\", and the three wished to press her on it. The committee chair, the SNPrsquos Linda Fabiani, refused to allow the question to be asked and said that the committee could discuss the matter in private session.This committee was supposed to be open and transparent. Is anyone surprised that that has turned out not to be the case  This inquiry has fallen at the first fence.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.ONE good thing about devolution is that three dferent political parties exercise responsibility in three dferent UK jurisdictions. So,the Tories want an end to government secrecy , then they could do so at Westminster immediately, and shame Holyrood into doing the same.Similarly with care homes. Inquiries could be set up in England and Wales tomorrow to see why excess deaths were so high, andnew residents may not have been isolated for the requisite period, orstaff were being moved from site to site. And it would save us in Scotland having to listen to the endless whinging of opposition politicians who could so easily do, what they say, is the ldquoright thing.GR Weir, Ochiltree.Read more: The Trial of Alex Salmond, BBC, review"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-test-trace-evade","story":"ON holiday in Spain, Ron Cowley spotted an article in a regional newspaper.

What would be reckless and unfair is keeping people trapped in jobs that they may never be able to go back, a reality that the SNP so far have failed to grasp.ldquoWe will continue to support businesses bringing back staff through the pound, job retention bonus, while our Plan for Jobs will drive our economic recovery by creating new roles for young people with the Kickstart scheme, and providing new incentives for training and apprenticeships."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11717020.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-scotland-face-coverings-become-law-schools-workplaces","story":"Nicola Sturgeon told her coronavirus briefing yesterday that it was ldquounder review, as the Scottish Government attempt to strike the right balance between ldquobeing as normal as possible and the learning experience for young people.It comes after a number of confirmed COVID- cases were reported in pupils across the country ndash with classes and even whole schools having to self-isolate.Face coverings could become mandatory in secondary schoolsA public health expert has since said that the mandatory wearing of masks in workplaces and secondary schools should be considered to keep them open.Coverings are compulsory in many indoor settings including shops, on public transport and in places such as cinemas, galleries, museums, libraries and banks.Professor Linda Bauld said they could be considered in other settingslevels of coronavirus go up.What did she say Asked in an interview on BBC Radio Scotland whether introducing face coverings in workplaces should be considered to allow more people to get back to work, she said: ldquoI donrsquot think we should rule it out.\"I thinkcases go up and we need particular settings to reopen that canrsquot, for whatever reason, face coverings indoors absolutely, but at the moment those sectors that can work from home ndash thatrsquos the message that I agree with ndash should continue to do that.Prof Bauld, who is professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, said the virus is at a ldquovery low level in terms of where we are in Scotland and that while it is circulating it is localised in terms of the rise in cases.Face coverings are already mandatory in some situationsShe said the best way to protect schools is to keep virus levels low, but that face coverings could be considered for secondary school pupils to avoid having to pause education.Prof Bauld said: ldquoIn terms of the cases that wersquore hearing about in school pupils, these are not cases that are occurring because pupils are catching the virus in the school setting, they are cases that are arising in the community, and when we have the virus circulating in the community even at low levels we know that children and young people may get it and then thereforethey go into the school they are still carrying it.She added: ldquoI thinkwe wanted to talk about, for example, face coverings for secondary school pupils rather than closing a school, thatrsquos another step we might want to discuss, thatrsquos being discussed in other places, but we donrsquot need it at the moment.\"We just have to think about what are the alternatives to having to pause education again because wersquore all trying to avoid that.Itrsquos now mandatory to wear a face covering in more indoor public places in Scotland.This video explains where you must wear one #Detailed guidance #

For as long as Nicola Sturgeon refuses to accept that Covid is here to stay and refuses to have an adult conversation about the level of infection and death that should be deemed acceptable, then not only will furlough be needed indefinitely, but our economy will never recover.The politicians have designed a Catch- situation with the  dichotomy of saving lives or genuinely restarting the economy. Politicians need to be honest and accept that Covid is a fact of le like cancer, heart disease, stroke and the many other illnesses that kill hundreds of Scots each week ndash for these we take proportionate measures to tackle them, but not measures that cause far more long-term harm than good.The continued refusal of Ms Sturgeon to have a truly adult,not dficult, conversation about our future shows she is not fit to lead us forward ndash that she is by design consigning tens of thousands of people to the unemployment scrap heap  her partys call to extend furlough is a thinly veiled acceptance of that. By definition, every action by Ms Sturgeon to introduce local lockdown or worse directly harms our economy and the future of every person reading this, be that the letime earnings of a young person, the chances of ever being re-employed for someone older or the worth of a pension for someone retired.Our politicians are causing more harm than good by refusing to make genuinely tough decisions.

I have tried to establish the viewing figures for what has now become an ongoing, daily SNP political broadcast, but BBC Scotland has remained tight-lipped regarding my information requests, pointing me instead to a third party body to whom it supplies viewing figures.Moreover, my initial e-mail to the Head of BBC Scotland outlining my information request, sent to an email address for the inidual in question found on the BBC website, resulted in an automated reply saying this email address does not accept incoming mail.For a public body, the BBC is far too secretive with non-commercial information, I suspect because it is only too aware ndash and maybe somewhere in the organisation somewhat embarrassed ndash that the cost per viewer for this daily bore is wholly unjustied.Paul McPhail, Glasgow G.IT is wrong to allow obvious infectious disease spreaders such as foreign travel, pubs, schools, funfairs, and amusement arcades to resume. Pubs and schools are already regenerating Covid infection. Meanwhile, easily controlled essential medical contact ndash such as in opticians ndash is denied. Proof positive that the entire process is being managed on a crowd-pleaser basis.Malcolm Parkin, Kinross.OVER recent weeks I have noticed a marked increase in the number of iniduals in supermarkets and shopping malls not wearing masks, some quite nonchalantly. Whilst I do not wish to impose unnecessary authoritarianism, the numbers failing to comply with the law is now getting out of hand, and pleas to use common sense are falling on deaf ears. Steps need to be taken to prevent people without good and veriable cause for not wearing a mask from entering shops and malls.I accept that this may be harder for small shops to apply, but at least supermarkets and shopping malls with security staff need to implement a no mask, no entry rule. To make things easier, free masks or masks at nominal cost could be available upon entry.It only takes one inidual to unwittingly cause a catastrophe. As far as claims this will impinge on inidual rights are concerned, sorry, for the present we are living in times when inidual rights must take second place to the overall common good. To deliberately believe otherwise is nothing short of selfish.Tom Garrett, Bishopton.IS it possible that retailers who allow non-exempt persons to enter their premises and make purchases without wearing personal protective equipment as required, currently, by the Scottish Governments edict, are also in breach of a mandatory order unless said retailers take action by refusing to serve said persons Patrick Garthwaite, Blairgowrie.Read more: OK, boomers, would you want to be a young one today "},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : pmOrkney MSP, Liam McArthur has demanded clarity from the Scottish Government on when Road Equivalent Tarfwill be delivered on Pentland Firth routes.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

With another  cases confirmed yesterday, that is  in just four days.On Saturday the Republic#s health authorities announced  cases there.The UK and Irish Republic have already begun to impose localised lockdowns in areas with high cases of the virus. Yesterday Stormont#s chief scientic adviser said the same approach could be taken here.Suddenly the outlook is a lot less optimistic than it had appeared.In May the Executive introduced its five-stage plan for exiting the lockdown. While many restrictions have been lted, some - including the reopening of wet pubs - have still to be acted on, amid lingering concerns of a second wave.The road map:On May  the Executive published its five-stage recovery strategy.Included in the first step of the plan were proposals for groups of four to six people to meet outside, churches to be permitted to open for private prayer, outdoor sports including golf and tennis to resume and more people encouraged toto work. Garden centres and large outdoor retailers were also permitted to reopen.In step two, up to  people could meet outdoors, while two to four people could meet indoors for short periods. Sports training would be allowed to resume and non-food retailers would be allowed to reopen.Step three would enable up to  people to meet outdoors along with the reopening of museums and galleries, with theatre rehearsals allowed to resume. Large indoor gatherings would be authorised, while the phasedof office working would be encouraged. Children were also set toto school on a part-time basis.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBishop of Down and Connor, Noel Treanor celebrates Mass under strict social distancing in St Peter’s Cathedral, west Belfast this morning.

Masks are also mandatory on public transport - although again enforcement is largely non-existent - and will be strongly encouraged for activities involving large numbers of staff or pupils in an enclosed space.Expert#s views:Queen#s University Belfastvirologist Dr Connor Bamford said that he believed Northern Ireland#s coronavirus lockdown had been successful.He said that the virus had been slowed down with cases being reported in single and double digits most days.However, while lockdown had worked well, he believes the virus was always present in Northern Ireland.We were always detecting cases and we were always seeing small clusters that would pop up in dferent parts of the country, he said.Dr Bamford said it was anticipated that, as restrictions were relaxed, cases would rise because the virus was present and most people remained susceptible. He said contact tracing had played a key role in identying new cases and clusters in Northern Ireland.The virologist, who emerged as one of Northern Ireland#s experts on the virus, said a dynamic approach was needed to deal with the virus going forward.We#re not out of the woods yet, certainly we would like to be able to reduce restrictions safely, but then we might have to bring in more restrictions as has been seen in other parts of the UK, Dr Bamford said.I would imagine nothing is off the table, we could be looking at lockdowns by city, or county or even given the size of Northern Ireland they may just decide to lockdown the entire country, it will depend purely on the circumstances surrounding the outbreak.Dr Bamford said the virus seemed to now be affecting more younger people as they were taking more risks as lockdown eased.We just can#t go back completely to normal until we have a very good vaccine, he said.We have to think of it as the #new normal#, it isn#t going to be forever, there will be a time when we won#t worry about Covid, but until then this is what the new normal has to be.However the virologist said he didn#t believe we were seeing the beginning of a second wave of the virus.I wouldn#t say that at this stage, but you#ll see with things like schools going back or large changes to lockdown, they all might sort of come together and you might see something that looks like the beginning of a second wave or a large outbreak, he said.Read More New lockdown restrictions comingCovid- cases continue to rise in Northern Ireland - Swann NI close to needing localised Covid restrictions, warns Prof Ian YoungDr Bamford praised the Executive#s fluid approach to managing the pandemic. However, he believes a policy of eradicating the virus should be pursued.I think more could be done to get rid of the virus in Northern Ireland and then it might be safer to reopen schools, he said.At the minute we#re all sort of responding to outbreaks, what happenswe really went after the virus and eradicated the virus from the country I think there#s a lot to be said about that because then you might not have to make the choice between opening schools or pubs.You need to find where that virus is and really go after it with more testing, community testing, but we#re not really doing that and we#re more managing the outbreaks. That could be a risky strategy.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Connor Bamford FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Connor BamfordUlster Bank economist Richard Ramsey said that even before the lockdown was introduced businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector, saw a downturn in custom and demand.He said when businesses were told to close, those who didn#t have cash reserves found themselves left exposed.However, Mr Ramsey said the scale of the support provided to businesses during lockdown was huge.If you thought beforehand that they would introduce things like a furlough scheme or eat out to help out, it wouldn#t have been thought possible, the economist said.While he accepted that some people may think not enough support has been provided, Mr Ramsey said that he believed further measures would be forthcoming.The chancellor isn#t done providing stimulus yet, we expect to see more in the autumn, it will be more targeted and dferent from what we#ve seen, it#s not the end of it, he said.Mr Ramsey said he believed businesses had come through the worst of the pandemic.We#ve seen huge falls in lockdown, it stopped dead, but you#ve then seen recovery, the corner had been turned in terms of activity, he said.He cautioned that the jobs market was one area that was set to get worse in the months to come.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseUlster Bank economist Richard Ramsey FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappUlster Bank economist Richard RamseyMy view:If the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise, then the Executive will have some very dficult decisions to make.Despite spending much of the past few years engaging in petty public squabbles, the parties came together when the outbreak began, just months after Stormont#s institutions were restored.Now as cases look to be on the rise once again, our politicians will have to decide what steps are necessary to halt the spread of the virus.Rolling back on any lockdown easements could be met with widespread public resistance.One only has to look at the debate created by the mandatory wearing - and, in some cases defiance - of masks to see the public has become weary of widespread government intervention in their lives.However, the Executive must do what it deems necessary to protect public health.If we continue to see Covid clusters developing in certain areas then we are more likely to see localised lockdowns, but the question remains how effective would this be in a country the size of Northern Ireland.Just a few short weeks ago cases were in the single figures, businesses and public facilities were reopening, people were ing to work and beginning to foresee ato some normality.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Doses of the Oxford vaccine PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDoses of the Oxford vaccine Now it feels like we are beginning to go backwards rather than forward.It is still unknown what effect reopening schools could have on the spread of the virus.If cases continues to rise then it is likely an increased number of deaths will follow.Should we see ato daily reports of multiple Covid- deaths, the Executive will be forced to take action, no matter how unpopular it may be.The virus remains unpredictable and until we have a widely available vaccine, any hopes of ato pre-Covid times seem distant.

The employees affected were back-of-house and had no contact with guests, it said.The resort just outside Cullybackey said management was in communication with the staff who tested positive to provide them with support Both will be tested again prior to ato work.The company said it had already tested almost  staff and would continue to conduct random testing.The Northern Ireland Open will also be played at Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort from September  to , with the Irish Open happening just over two weeks later.Originally scheduled for Mount Juliet in Kilkenny in May, the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open was postponed because of the pandemic.The requirement by the Irish government that all visitors from the US restrict their movements for  days would have decimated the field.But six days ago, it was announced that it would be held behind closed doors at Galgorm Castle near Ballymena. The European Tour praised Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort for stepping up as hosts.By heading to Northern Ireland, players would be able to travel directly to a UK airport and tee up in one of the European Tour#s flagship events.It would also mean those participating in the previous week#s US Open would be able to play.However, Co Down#s Rory McIlroy on Wednesday ruled himself out of playing.I#m planning to stay in the States. I don#t see myself travelling internationally for a while, he said.The  year old added: It might be dferentthere could be fans there and stuff, but it#s behind closed doors and it#s not an Irish Open like we#re used to it being the last few years with obviously big prize funds and everything. But not even that,just the fact that I just want to spend time at home and not travel too much the next few months. Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort became one of the UK#s first hospitality businesses to secure the new AA Covid Confident Mark ahead of reopening in late July.Galgorm Collection managing director Colin Johnston said: We share the concerns around the recent increase in the number of Covid- cases and, like many employers in the area, we have been monitoring this extremely closely. In response, we have already put additional measures in place. Last week, we moved to the next phase of our agreed comprehensive hygiene commitment plan, which includes increased random testing of team members who continue to operate within team bubbles.In addition, we are also the first company in Northern Ireland to introduce a Mistpal Cleansing Tunnel for team members and guests entering the resort for further safety reassurance. This is in addition to already established measures including a nightly full deep-clean of all areas with hospital-grade sanitiser protectant and decontamination equipment, thermal temperature monitoring, provision of hand sanitisers in all areas and adherence to recommended social distancing guidelines.Mr Johnston said the health and safety of staff and guests was paramount and we are grateful for their continued support and also to those guests who have rescheduled their stay as a result of the robust pre-entry testing measures we have in place.

He said concerns are growing in light of changes in the reproductive rate of Covid- in recent weeks and the potential for new restrictions, due to be discussed by the Executive today. We#ve been trying to stay positive about how excited we are in terms getting students back in the classroom for the first time since March next week and give our support to the Stormont ministers to get this right, Dr Gault told the Belfast . But sadly the truth is the guidance is appalling and its sparsity has left an unacceptable additional workload on the shoulders of principals. It#s totally insufficient, contradictory, confusing and nothing more than a series of open-ended recommendations with a #do what you can and let#s hope for the best#-type attitude .There is a genuine fear in the profession that this guidance may not be achievable in some schools and it#s a level of angst that I#ve never seen before. Even the most experienced and robust principals say they are on their knees, he added. Read More Peter Weir under fire from all sides at Stormont after A-Levels furore Guidance for reopening NI schools branded #unrealistic and unfair# by union Dr Gault, who is also the vice-president of the National Association of Head Teachers , is preparing for theof  pupils and  staff at his own school, Maghaberry Primary. The new school term begins next Monday for P, Year  and Year  pupils and for vulnerable children across all year groups.All other pupils willto school the following week. Theto school will be on a full-time basis of five days a week for all pupils, including those who attend special schools.Revised from previous proposals set out in June, Mr Weir#s new guidance has used advice from Northern Ireland#s chief medical and scientic officers and the UK government#s advisory body Sage.There are deliberate ambiguities in the guidance which have been left for principals to deal with such as how does a teacher with a full-time classroom commitment provide learning for a child who is unable to attend school, Dr Gault added. The guidance says this learning should be provided with a blended approach but this can#t happenthat teacher is in the classroom from - every day.We all understand that this has been a very dficult call for Minister Weir to make but with the guidance as it stands, parents are expecting principals to have all the answers.We have had a lot of support from our parents as they understand the plight that schools like ours find themselves in but there is anxiety too especially among those with vulnerable family members that this restart is carried out safely.An additional few weeks to help schools digest this guidance and go back to ministers and health chiefs to seek clarity on ious matters would have made a dference, he said. Dr Gault will raise his concerns directly with officials when he appears before the Education Committee tomorrow. He has expressed concern over the availability of substitute teachersstaff are required to self-isolate should they develop Covid- symptoms. This is a huge issue that will potentially close schools, particularly in terms of the cost implications and the fact is that we#re already going into this year with schools in financial crisis.Some schools have said that their bill for substitute teachers could be £, a month or in some cases £, for the year - funds that they don#t have. Dr Gault has called on Stormont ministers to offer reassurance and show leadership. What is their plan to support me as a principal in delivering this restart because in my view there isn#t one. Unlike our colleagues in the Republic, we haven#t had an Executive that has really got behind our profession to support us in terms of the restart so every principal is just going to have to do their best.I don#t have a helpline or someone I can phone with questions so I#m just going to be left with this guidance and to be honest I#m frightened.Mr Weir told his Stormont scrutiny committee earlier this week that bringing children back to school full time is a priority across the Executive table. He has said that the guidance will continue to reflect public health advice and that he will keep all medical and scientic developments under review.I understand the need for schools to reopen for the economy and wider society tobut we also need to see more being done to ensure the safety of staff and pupils.Being content with this guidance isn#t good enough when we are talking about thousands of people in very small rooms and teachers feeling scared, Dr Gault said.

North Antrim DUP MP Ian Paisley said he was concerned about the impact of the closure on the agri-food industry. He said the company had behaved responsibly but added: “We cannot have a situation where Covid prevents factory production that ultimately damages the NI agri-food sector.

Asda said: Whilst we are disappointed that the application has been deferred we will continue to work with all concerned to successfully progress our plans for a new store in Newtownabbey.Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, said it was strongly opposed to the plan.Speaking at the weekend, he said: Retail NI is of the view that this out-of-town superstore application is in clear breach of the current Town Centre First retail planning policy and we are concerned it may be granted for short-term reasons to bring Asda to Newtownabbey.Planning policy must be the only criteria.He claimed out-of-town stores displaced existing town centre roles.

A body which represents the industry, Hospitality Ulster, has told the Executive that non-food or ‘wet pubs’ have been left ‘without any hope’. A financial package from the Executive is now ‘urgently needed’ to save many businesses employing dozens of people in Derry despite hotels, restaurants, and pubs serving food operating safely since July , says Hospitality Ulster Chief Executive Colin Neill. Pubs were set to reopen on August  but a decision has now been pushed back for a number of weeks. googletag.cmd.push However, further easing of the lockdown - including the reopening of pubs - depends on the rate at which the virus is spreading in the community. Mr Neill said the Executive needs to support pubs: “Although we have an indicative date of  September, that is an eternity away and there is no guarantee that this date will even be met. “I have pressed the case for non-food pubs to be open as soon as possible, andnot, then a bespoke financial package must be delivered immediately. “The consequences of no support will mean that many jobs will be at risk, on top of those who have already been made redundant. googletag.cmd.push “We now need to take a pragmatic approach and raised with the Executive Office Ministers, a number of ways in which we can get non-food pubs open in a safe way, just like the rest of the hospitality sector.” As preparations were made to come out of lockdown in May ideas were floated such as making use of Guildhall Square and outdoor spaces in the city centre, however, those plans for the most part have not come to fruition. Derry City and Strabane District Council said it continues to meet with representatives from ious government departments and key stakeholders to proactively bring forward a number of positive initiatives aimed at assisting with the ‘safe recovery and reopening’ of the city centre. SAFE SPACES A council spokesperson said stakeholders have looked at a number of new creative and innovative ways at providing more space and a safe environment that will enhance the city centre visitor experience. She continued: “Council is very supportive of Department for Infrastructure’s desire to put measures into place within the Walled City to reduce traffic and to improve conditions for pedestrians. “We believe that this will provide assurance to the public and will assist our businesses in planning for social distancing as part of their recovery plans.” They say work is ongoing to assist with this process and to also look at how such pilot schemes could possibly be extended to Strabane and other parts of the district over time. In terms of street trading and licensing, the council is looking at ways of resolving the challenges that exist and ensuring that government guidelines and health advice are being adhered to. A temporary Pavement Cafeacute Licencing scheme has been introduced to assist hospitality retail businesses and agreed to temporarily waiver all fees associated with granting a temporary licence for a period of six months. Although pavement cafes may not be suitable for all businesses or streets, it is believed that pavement cafes may help some hospitality retail premises during the recovery phase and assist with adhering to current social distancing guidelines when they reopen. The council is currently processing  pavement cafeacute licence applications. A spokesperson added: “The council will continue to work in partnership with the department in the coming weeks to engage with businesses and the public to ensure that whatever measures are put in place are reflective of the needs of all our local stakeholders.” The council added that any changes in relation to the pedestrianisation of streets would have to be agreed by the relevant government departments and key stakeholders and in consultation with the local businesses. NEW SCHEMES The Department for Infrastructure said the minister is committed to working towards reimagining and reshaping spaces as part of an ambitious Executive recovery plan. As part of this recovery phase, there is a need to provide additional temporary pedestrian space in urban centres to accommodate social distancing. The department is working to identy where measures to re-allocate road space may be appropriate to facilitate local footway widening and social distancing. A spokesperson commented: “The department has been working closely with Derry City and Strabane District Council to devise projects in order to adapt to a new way of living, driven in part by the ongoing Covid- emergency. “Together we have already initiated a project to provide widened and pop-up cycle lanes on the Foyle Riverside in the city centre. “The department is also a member of the City Centre Economic Stakeholder Group, which is chaired by Derry City  Strabane District Council, and is focused on co-ordinating the phased and safe recovery of Derry’s city centre. “The group is exploring schemes such as footway widening, timed traffic exclusions, temporary traffic management measures and streetspace repurposing. “Further details will be announced in due course.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a speech made in the Northern Ireland Assembly today, Sinead McLaughlin MLA, the SDLPs economy spokesperson, spoke of the need to lt the cap on student numbers at Northern Ireland universities. She said: Northern Ireland has a unique educational disadvantage across the four UK nations – theMaSNcap. The Maximum Student Numbers. This holds back our economy by deprivingusof the skills we need.Thissituation damagesour productivity as well as our decision-making. But it also addsmomentumto the Northern Irish diaspora, breaking up families as children leave home to study in Great Britain, typically to never . googletag.cmd.push As a mother I have seen my daughters leave Northern Ireland to study. And that is finewhen that is whatstudents want to do. But we are forcing our students away because our universities do not have enough places. Thatsplitsup families and is heartbreaking. And – as a report from the OECD concluded just a few days ago – it is not providing the next generation of graduate talent that our economy needs for the future.Nor are we doing enough for those students who do not go to university, who need high quality apprenticeships and a future in well paid, emotionally rewarding work. googletag.cmd.push But today theongoing failure around theMaSNcap has become a crisis. That is because the farce around A level grades has forced our two universities to breach theMaSNcap imposed on them by the Department for the Economy. Last week they offered places – which they are bound tohonour– to students with the required minimum grades. But this week they are also bound tohonourprevious conditionaloffers to students who with the revised grades now meet those conditions.This mess is not of the universities’ making. Yet it potentially creates a very serious financial situation for the universities. And it is not aone yearproblem. The universities will be breaching theMaSNcap this year, and each of the next three years – four years for some courses – because that is theof undergraduate study. Are we really expecting the universities to pick up the financial cost of the A level fiasco  Yesterday the British media reported that the education secretary for England, Gavin Williamson,had promised that all UK universities would be released from their student number cap to allow all students with sufficient A level grades to be accepted. That is no doubt a misreport because the British media doesn’t understand the dference between theUK and GB. But it does allow us to consider an important point. This mess is not entirely of the making of Peter Weir, our Department of Education and CCEA. It is also a mess of the making of Gavin Williamson and the British government. Sothe answer is clear. We must lt theMaSNcap for Northern Ireland, allowing students with sufficient grades to study at university in Northern Ireland. We must not expect the two universities here to pick up the bill for that. And given the role of theUK government, we expect the education, economyand finance ministers here to very robustly make the case to the UK government that it should pick up the bill for this.

A song and video was created by sisters Sadie , Pennyand Darcyduring the Covid- lockdown with the help of local musician Roy Arbuckle. Like many grandchildren, they have been unable to visit their grandparents since the start of the pandemic and have missed them dearly. The girls normally travel to Derry every month to visit their grandparents but sadly despite the easing of restrictions they’ve been unable to make the trip across the Irish Sea. googletag.cmd.push However, working on the song ‘My Granny was a Factory Girl’ brought them closer together while they’ve had to be apart. Their song, was written in honour of The Factory Girls from the famous shirt factory era, of which their granny Sadie Harkin was one. Along with their granny, the girls have been supporting the ongoing campaign to install a permanent tribute which celebrates the contribution factory girls made to local le. In ode to those workers the song was created and acts as a poignant tribute at this time. The project was developed and produced virtually, using only iPhone recordings, Zoom sessions and FaceTime. googletag.cmd.push A red brick wall provided the ideal backdrop for the video. Speaking to the Derry News about the making of the video, Sadie said: “It was quite fun because originally it was out the back of the house but then we moved to a bigger brick wall outside a pub. “The first time I had my hair down and the wind was blowing my hair about my face. But over the next few days it was raining and raining and we had to time it right. “Then we got a good day and it was perfect.” A target of pound had been set but the girls have now far exceeded that total with over pound raised as of Friday. It’s ‘amazing’, Sadie said excitedly: “I thought we’d be luckywe got pound, then the next day I logged on it was pound and I thought, ‘oh my gosh’, and today it was pound, I couldn’t believe it.” She said that her granny is ‘very proud’ and cried when she first saw the music video. Singing is Sadie’s ‘passion’ and she has ambitions to write more songs.  FOYLE HOSPICE When making the song the sisters sent recordings and videos from Stockport, to Derry, to Rochdale to Casablanca and back again, many times over for tweaking and finalising. The collaboration would not have been possible without the involvement and encouragement of local legend, Roy Arbuckle. Roy believed in the songs message and the little singers performing it from the beginning, inspiring the girls and sharing his time and knowledge generously. After becoming aware of the Foyle Hospice’s Emergency Appeal the sisters and their granny wanted to use the song to fundraise for the ‘wonderful charity’. The song was further developed during Sadie’s music lessons, which managed to continue remotely, with her music amazing tutor, Phil Reynolds. Phil helped immensely by coaching and bringing all the layers together, even working with Sadie to develop harmonies and write the piano music to accompany it. The final push and motivation came from the creative genius that is Darren Norris, who whilst on lockdown in Casablanca supported the project by offering assistance with the video. Bernadette Walsh at The Tower Museum, and some of the Factory Girls, supported a request for photos to use in the video. Sadie said: “The response was fantastic with the bonus of them sharing their own memories of stories from the factory floor. “We couldn’t be happier with the response it’s had.” Coincidentally, the girls all attend the same Stockport school that released the hit song, ‘There’s no one quite like Grandma’ in , also about a granny, by St. Winred’s School Choir.

It comes after this week’s A-level results changes that mean many students will be awarded higher teacher assessed grades. As a result universities will have to offer additional places with Queens University Belfastsaying it may need up to , extra. That will necessitate the lting of the maximum student numberscap. However, at yesterdays Economy Committee meeting at Stormont, Derry MLAs Gary Middleton and Sinead McLaughlin raised concerns thatthe correct decisions arent made it could lead to further regional imbalance with more students enrolling in Belfast courses. googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA Gary Middleton said there are several hundred unfilled places at Magee. While, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said thatUlster University wants to see growth at Magee it has to be engineered through the relocation of courses and the university has to invest in the marketing of the campus. The Department for the Economycontrols the number of undergraduate places available at QUB and Ulster Universityfor students from NI and those from outside the UK. Both institutions are allowed to accept between ,-, new undergraduates from Northern Ireland every year The cap exists in Northern Ireland in order to keep tuition fee costs down but results in huge competition for places. googletag.cmd.push It also means that on some courses NI students are expected to get higher grades than their counterparts applying from Great Britain. Derry politicians have called for the MaSN cap to be lted to allow universities to accommodate more students. They’ve insisted that the Magee campus should be prioritised, citing long-promised expansion to , students. However, it is courses that will determine demand and in turn additional places. A UU spokesperson said that it envisages increased demand for Magee courses such as Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence and Personalised Medicine. She commented: “At Ulster University, students are our absolute priority and we will be as flexible as possible in order to accommodate the maximum number of students possible within our existing funding and the additional flexibility already provided by Department for the Economy. “We are actively preparing for the anticipated additional demand by building in additional places for some of our most popular courses including Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence, Engineering, Law, Accounting, and Personalised Medicine. “To avail of these additional places, we urge students to contact us as soon as possible on    to discuss your options with an advisor.” The DfE pointed out that responsibility for MaSN allocation lies with Higher Education institutions. A spokesperson for the DfE said: “Until the local universities have received access to the full range of revised grades for all applicant students, they will not be able to confirm places for students or otherwise. “As such, until this process has been completed, there is no way of assessing the number of any additional HE places there may be, nor what the impact might be for each HE institution with regards to their respective MaSNs.” She added: “With regards to the MaSN cap, it is allocated on an institutional-level basis and relates to all full-time undergraduate NI and EU domiciled students it is for each institution to decide how to allocate its MaSN across both subject areas and campuses. “The Economy Minister has stated thatshe will be working with Executive colleagues to ensure that additional places and extra resources are put in place to support universities as soon as possible. “Enrolments for previous years are available athttps:www.economy-ni.gov.uk articles higher-education-enrolments”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The colony was one of several built under the terms of the  Irish LandAct to cater for ex-servicemen ing from the First World War. Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for £,-- - £, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around £ per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June . A map showing the location of the cottages at Messines Park. Residents established a local British Legion branch and an accompanying hall was built just outside the development in .

German bombers swarmed the skies. Belfast bore the brunt of a -strong Luftwaffe squadron, with  dead and , injured as a result. Seventy miles up the road, Derry was hit only once. It was not the Germans’ planned target. Thirteen lives were lost when a German bomb overshot its proposed target and hit Messines Park in Shantallow, home to a colony of ex-servicemen who had served in the Great War. Messines Park was named after the  Battle of Messines, in which the thDivision and thDivision had fought side by side. The colony was one of several built under the terms of the  Irish LandAct to cater for ex-servicemen ing from the First World War. googletag.cmd.push Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for pound,-- - pound, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around pound per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June .

German bombers swarmed the skies. Belfast bore the brunt of a -strong Luftwaffe squadron, with  dead and , injured as a result. Seventy miles up the road, Derry was hit only once. It was not the Germans’ planned target. Thirteen lives were lost when a German bomb overshot its proposed target and hit Messines Park in Shantallow, home to a colony of ex-servicemen who had served in the Great War. Messines Park was named after the  Battle of Messines, in which the thDivision and thDivision had fought side by side. The colony was one of several built under the terms of the  Irish LandAct to cater for ex-servicemen ing from the First World War. googletag.cmd.push Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for pound,-- - pound, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around pound per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June . A map showing the location of the cottages at Messines Park. Residents established a local British Legion branch and an accompanying hall was built just outside the development in . A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park. Sixty-year old James was the oldest victim of the bombing and was originally from Eglinton. He was stationed at Finner Camp in County Donegal when he met and married Elizabeth Doherty in  at Glendermott Parish Church. Their daughter Ellen was born in  and was just  when she died. Both were buried in Glendermott Parish Church. William McFarland Born at Fountain Street in Derry City, William Alexander McFarland had been working as a fitter before he enlisted with the Royal Engineers in . He served with Fortress Company at Salonica for over three years and was living at Hawkin Street in the city before he was transferred to Class Z Army Reserve in . William married Elizabeth Reid in  at St Augustine’s Church of Ireland and worked after the war in the Employment Exchange. A member of the Messines Park branch of the British Legion, he was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Force when he died, aged , in the bombing raid. The Murray Family Six members of the Murray family, who lived at  Messines Park, lost their lives in the bombing. William , was born on Donegal Street and married Omagh woman Molly Gormanin  at St Columb’s Catholic Church. William had served with the Guards during World War One and was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Volunteers when he died. Four of their children Ita , Kathleen , Philomenaand Sheiladied during the attack.Sheila was the youngest victim. The Richmond Family The  German bomb claimed the lives of four members of the Richmond family. John Richmond was born in  in the Waterside and had been right at the thick of the war. Stationed in China with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, he landed on Y Beach, Cape Helles, at the start of the Gallipoli land campaign. After being taken prisoner at Bertencourt, he was held in prisoner of war camps in Le Quesnoy Limburg and Dulman, before being discharged as ‘no longer physically fit for war service’ in . Johnand his we Winred , along with their children Owenand Bridgetdied during the Messines Park attack and were buried in Derry City Cemetery.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was the first time Ballinascreen were levelin a game they trailed by nine points coming up to half time. With a superior score dference, a draw wouldve been enough for Lavey, but points for Cleary and Aaron Kelly put them ahead. Fintan Bradley had a late free, but his low effort was saved by goalkeeper Marty Mulgrew and it was Screen that held on for a victory that seemed unlikely for long periods. googletag.cmd.push Their reward is a semi-final rematch with Kevin Lynchs, with Slaughtneil facing parish rivals Swatragh on the other side of the draw.

Lavey had the breeze at their back and with greater urgency in their play went four points ahead before Screen got to grips with the game. The Erins Own men were awarded a penalty but referee Niall Clford adjudged Fintan Bradley to have broken the line when he shot and the penalty was overturned. googletag.cmd.push Bradley was putting over some sweet scores, but missed a simple free before the break. Noel Raffertyand Paul Cleary scored early second half points for Screen, as they came back into the game. The concern at Davitt Park was the falling light and as the game developed, visibility was becoming more of a problem. Midway through the second half, Colm Murphy can feel hard done by to pick up a second yellow card and Lavey were down to  men. Seconds earlier, Noel Rafferty looked to have a certain penalty shout waved on. Without Murphy, Lavey were not able to match Screens hunger around the breaking ball and the game was already slipping away from them. Two Fintan Bradley frees looked to have weathered the storm until McSorleys winning goal.

As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Head Boy and Head Girl at St Patricks College, Maghera, Seamus McKenna and Maireacutead Comer, said the uncertainty of this years system had led to extra levels of stress. After seeing the fallout from the release of results in Scotland, Seamus admitted to a restless night last week. “I didnt get one hour of sleep on Wednesday night. Because mine is so competitive, evenI had got A*AB, or two A*s and a B, I wouldnt have got in,” he said. “That was my biggest fear. After hearing what had happened last week over there, I was preparing myself for the possibility of a B. googletag.cmd.push “Our school doesnt have the greatest history in a lot of the STEM subjects, and when youre up against grammar schools, who do have that bit more experience with those, it puts the pressure on,” he added. “Even with the other subjects, its a dferent class every year and theres not necessarily the same people who are going to get an A*, or a B, or whatever,” said Maireacutead Comer, who will be going on to study Irish at Ulster University in September. “It really puts people on the back foot, because youre thinking the history of the subject isnt great in getting more than one or two A*s and thats why a lot of ours were marked down.” googletag.cmd.push The students felt the original system was unfairly weighted against comprehensive schools. “I think the reality is that schools like ourselves, St Colms in Draperstown and St Conors were hit with a postcode lottery,” said Seamus. “The worst part is, because were a comprehensive school, were immediately given the worst batch of the grades because of the area we come from. “Ive experienced grammar-comprehensive discrimination, especially trying to get into Medicine. Youre immediately picked out from the bunch because youre from a comprehensive school. “When they started doing this with the grades, it was beyond a joke.” “Its not really fair, especially for the people who were expecting to repeat some of their exams to further the chances of getting the grades they wanted,” added Head Girl, Maireacutead Comer. “I was marked down in one of mine, but I wasnt in such a bad position, and I was lucky in that sense, but it really did put on the back foot those people who needed those last few months to push on.” Despite the added stress of battling an algorithim, both are looking ahead in excitement at what is to come. “Its a relief to know that youre actually going on somewhere . We were starting to sort things like Leavers jerseys, while still stuck, but its nice to know were moving on now” said Maireacutead. “Im definitely looking forward to the change of scenery. Im going to miss this place quite a lo. Weve been through so much, , particularly this year,” added Seamus.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Education Minister Peter Weir yesterday announced a u-turn on results, with all pupils now to be given the higher of the grades submitted by their centre or the grade calculated by CCEA Over a third of all AS and A grades given to students by teachers had been originally downgraded by CCEAs standardisation system last week in a move which drew critcisim from schools, parents and pupils. One County Derry school saw  percent of its results downgraded. Their principal, who wished to remain anonymous, said the system is flawed. googletag.cmd.push “The actual child was taken out of the entire process,” they told the County Derry Post. “Education reports always say, the child is at the centre of all that we do. This system took the child out of the equation and everyone became a number and a statistic. “Nobody sat down and worked out our grades. This is an algorithim or some way of putting all the data into a computer and spewing it back out again.“No heed was paid to teachers professional judgement. the child has been taken out of the equation – and it was a mathematical equation.” The way in which schools previous performance was factored into the process had also caused controversy, with many feeling pupils at comprehensive schools are at a further disadvantage. googletag.cmd.push Having seen a dip in one particular subject the previous year, the affected school poured efforts into rectying the situation, only to see their work negated by the standardisation system. “In one subject this time last year we were devastated [with the results]. If I sat with my arms folded, we would have got the same results this year,” said the Principal. “Those who were sitting looking at our estimated grades and our AS Level grades from the bad situation, dont know what we were doing all year to turn it around. “We were moving mountains to change the situation that CCEA used for that particular subject. “Theyve used the history of subjects. Ours is a high achieving school. One year a child came to us in third year, with no English, and achieved ten A* grades. Does that mean thatthat child had been doing those exams the way they were done this year, they wouldnt have got the ten A* grades, because we had no history of that  “Theyve said, we cant give them four As in Maths, because theyve never had four As in Maths. Does that mean that every year, a child doesnt get the opportunity to get an A  “Specically with our school, they had brought our percentage to  percent. We have never, in the history of A-Levels here, got  percent. So how did they come to that conclusion ” There was criticism also of CCEAs handling of the appeal process and its associated advice. The school only received official advice on the appeals process at .pm on the evening the results came out. “I received guidance on how to write an appeal at .pm. I was at home. We walked out of here yesterday with all our appeals all done and we got that at home” said the Principal. “Nobody can explain why these people have been pulled down. They gave us a webinar on Tuesday before the results came out as a background to how theyve reached the conclusion. “You can have all the webinars you like, butyoure going to disadvantage children, Im going to be shouting, and were not the only school. “We had plenty of good results too, but its the fact that they changed so many pupils. CCEA are saying it was a third that were changed. “If they hadchanged a third of ours, I would not be on the phone to you now, but they have taken  percent of our pupils down. “They were utterly devastated. We have children who looked at a screen last week that said they were unsuccessful in their attempt to get into their university choice. “We spent two full weeks in lockdown sorting out these centre-assessed grades. We might as well not have bothered.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s off the chart.” Dara said “would never in a million years have picked the Shakira number, but he put his own twist on it while also being praised for being supportive towards the other contestants. His U teammates from St Colm’s GAC will get another chance to see Dara on the screen as he progresses to the semi-final of the competition next week. Mrs Roisiacuten McKenna, principal of Daras school, St Colms, Draperstown, said the opportunity to showcase his ability was well-deserved. googletag.cmd.push “The teachers, staff and pupils of St Colms High School are delighted with Daras success on The Voice Kids and we wish him good luck for the semi-final on Saturday night,” she told the County Derry Post. “Dara is a very talented young man, very modest and unassuming and he thoroughly deserved this opportunity to showcase his wonderful talent. “Everyone in St Colms will be cheering him on this weekend.” You can watch Dara battle it out with Paloma Faiths other acts for a place in the final when the semi-final stage is aired this Saturday, August , at .pm on ITV.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The vaccination programme officially begins on October , , however it is likely that deliveries of the vaccine will arrive from the end of August enabling the programme to commence in September once GPs have received their initial orders. Health Minister Robin Swann said:Given there is currently no vaccine to combat Covid-, it is extremely important that we take all necessary measures to help reduce the risk of the flu circulating alongside Covid- during autumn and winter. googletag.cmd.push “I have asked my Department to increase the availability of the flu vaccine this year to additional groups of people in an effort to reduce health risks in iniduals and reduce the pressure on our health and social care system.” The Chief Medical Officer, Dr Michael McBride, said:“Flu can present with similar symptoms to Covid- and therefore has the potential to complicate the contact tracing and surveillance programme. There is also emerging evidence that co-infection with Covid- and flu may lead to a more severe illness. Reducing the pressure caused by seasonal flu will help preserve the capacity of the health and social care system to manage any future waves of Covid-.” googletag.cmd.push The current groups eligible for a free flu vaccination are everyone aged  and over, pregnant women, those aged under  years of age in clinical “at risk” groups, all children aged  to , all primary school pupils, and frontline health and social care workers. Additional vaccine has been secured which will allow for the following groups to receive a free flu vaccination during the   flu vaccination programme: Household contacts of those who received shielding letters during the Covid- pandemic can request vaccination via their GPStaff in independent care homes and school children in year  i.e. those who will be in the firstyear of secondary school from September . Subject to vaccine availability, the programme may be extended by December to include those in the - year old age group, starting with the oldest first. This extension will be phased to allow GP practices to prioritise those in a clinical at risk group. Minister Swann added“Everyone who is eligible for a free flu vaccine should take this opportunity and help protect themselves and those around them this winter.” The vaccine will be available through the schools programme, from GPs, and through Trust vaccination schemes for staff.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An accident in stage six of last weekends Rally Liepāja in Latvia, saw him forced out of the race. Devine, the current Motorsport Ireland International Driver of the Year, was out to make amends following an early retirement on the opening round in Italy late last month. Callum missed the pre event shakedown and qualying due to an issue with his Hyundai i R, but the mechanics had ready for the start of the event. He was beginning to grow in confidence on his first loose surface event at this level. Steady driving saw Callum and co-driver Brian Hoy work their way into the top  early on day two and up to fourth place among the ERC Junior crews. googletag.cmd.push It all came to an end on stage six , as Devine recalls. “We were actually just starting to get into it and growing in confidence. As I mentioned before the event, it’s not a place you want to get things wrong as the speeds are so high. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what happened. We carried a bit too much speed into a fast right hander and caught the undergrowth on the outside of the corner, sending us into a roll and out of the event. Myself and Brian are okay, just a little sore and thankfully all the safety equipment stood up to the accident, the Hyundai is a strong car. googletag.cmd.push I’m just so disappointed for all the team who worked so hard over the last month. To have taken just one point from the opening pair of rallies is sickening and doesn’t reflect all the work we’ve put in, hopefully we can put it right before the end of the season.” Devine’s accident casts some doubt over his participation in the next round of the championship, Rallye Azores in mid-September. The PCRS team will assess the damage to the car in the coming days but evenit can be sorted in time to make the boat to travel to the Azores, presently Portugal and its associated territories aren’t on the Irish green list for travel. “If the car can be sorted for Azores, travel restrictions could be an issue. As it stands, not only myself and Brian, but also all the mechanics would have to isolate for two weeks after ing to Ireland after the rally. I work between events so to isolate for two weeks uponwould be a big problem. Obviously government guidelines are changing all the time so we’ll just have to wait and see. It’s worth pointing out this isn’t just a problem for us, it’s a problem for all competitors and teams in the championship.” While Rallye Azores may be in doubt, one thing that isn’t in doubt in Devine’s commitment to the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy. “I realise how lucky I am to have this opportunity and I’m ready to knuckle down and refocus in preparation for our next ERC event,” Devine continued. Following Rallye Azores, the remaining rounds of the  ERC will take place in Cyprus, Hungary and the Canary Islands.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

dficulties getting rid of waste water and it is believed the problem is because their homes are below the level of the sewage treatment plant in Spa.Mr Bicker said Water Service officials are addressing the problem in a bid to come up with a solution and says that until they have completed their work, no new homes should be constructed in the Spa area.He revealed that  new homes are already in the pipeline and fears once they have been constructed, they will exacerbate the sewage problem.Mr Bicker said he has every sympathy for the Water Services engineers currently working to resolve what he described as a ldquoparticularly dficult problem.NEWCASTLE mdash The future of Newcastle Chamber of Commerce is under threat because a shortage of funding may rob the body of its long-serving secretary.Chamber officials believe it will be extremely dficult for the body to continue to exist in any meaningful way without the services of Maria Cunningham, who has worked for the group on a full-time basis for the past seven years.And to further compound the problem, a special Chamber meeting in the town on Monday night was attended by just nine out of its  membership, a

Gardens housing estate in Killyleagh.The move comes after local community Billy Walker highlighted problems experienced by residents in the area.The entrance to Killyleaghrsquos new Bridge Centre is at the end of the local housing estate and the speed ramps are designed to slow the speed of vehicles in the area.Mr Walker said he is delighted Roads Service officials have agreed to provide the speed ramps and says the move will also be welcomed by residents in the Braeside Gardens area.ldquoThe residents are growing increasingly concerned about the speed of vehicles along a narrow street

around an RAF for over  years, but has, for some time, suffered a rapid decline in amenities.Three hundred people have moved to the area over the past four years and another housing development is on the cards leaving members of the local community association fearful the infrastructure will be unable to cope.The steady degeneration in local services from the area means residents are now forced to travel to Ardglass or Downpatrick for basic provisions, as well as collecting benefits, banking and medical needs.With a limited number of bus services running through the area, many are finding it hard to fit the journey in with their routine, forcing many, including young mothers with children, to pay for taxis or even walk to Ardglass for something as simple as a pint of milk.BALLYNAHINCH

Not only does dance allow kids to get their energy out, itrsquos also a great way for children to express themselves. Itrsquos never too early to encourage a love of physical activity in children.Briacuted is passionate about the benefits of dance for young children. ldquoDance is wonderful for coordination. It develops strength and endurance. Through dancing, a toddler will learn from the early age about what their bodies are capable of, she says.ldquo At the same time, it will build their curiosity as naturally they will experiment with certain movements. If toddlers have been introduced to dancing since early age, the chance of them developing good kinesthetic memory is increased.ldquoDuring class we work on key skills such as counting and sequencing thus subtlety engaging with numeracy and literacy. We incorporate sensory props such as ribbons, scarfs, feathers, bubbles and each dancer brings their own favourite toy to dance with. We introduce the foundations of Irish dance and enjoy watching a potential le long journey of dance begin.Following the Tapping Tots class, some  dancers attended the studio for an Irish dance camp with a dference. The week was jam-packed with lots of dancing, fitness, teamwork, arts, crafts and fun.Dance teacher Christopher Owens said: ldquoWe are delighted with the success of our summer dance camp. has posed signicant disappointments for our dancers on a competitive front with event after event being cancelled.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose. To their credit, Downpatrick did not throw in the towel.Caolan Mooney burst through on the Downpatrick goal not long before half-time and a penalty was awardedwhen he was up-ended by goalkeeper Deeny. Shaun Parr stepped up and netted Rostrevorrsquos third goal.Downpatrick were given a glimmer of hope just before the interval when Parr and then Sean Cooper were black-carded.However at half-time, and the score at - to -, Downpatrickrsquos task looked onerous.The RGU came out with the right attitude to mount a revival in the second half and Doylersquos early minor reduced the gap.Chris Magee helped lead the Downpatrick forward linersquos continuing assaults on the Rostrevor goal with a couple of scores. And there emerged a real feeling of optimism amongst the massed Downpatrick ranks when Conor McGradyrsquos point left just two in it.However Rostrevor refused to hit the panic button. Guided by the experience of Mooney, they stretched their lead before the next water break.Downpatrick were awarded a penalty with the scoreboard reading - to -. However when Rostrevor needed a big moment at just the right time, goalkeeper Gareth Clarke provided it, plunging to push Tim Prenterrsquos effort to safety.That was the moment which really deflated Downpatrickrsquos resolve. You sensed that Rostrevor knew they had weathered the best that Downpatrick could summon in response to their deficit.Jordan Fegan then broke away in the closing minutes, before splitting the posts and taking Rostrevorrsquos score to -.Kane applied a classy coup de grace with the final score of the evening for the victors when he spun the Downpatrick defence and, bearing down on goal, took the safe option of landing the point.In the end it looked plain sailing on paper for Rostrevor. Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
