They diagnosed ten cases each versus typically two and four cases respectively for April and May combined.However, rates in the other three units were similar to previous years. Of the 30 children, 21 were tested for Covid-19 if they had symptoms including fever or cough. Two tested positive. Some children were tested using antibody kits, which have not been widely available to the public.Of the 16 other children given an antibody test, three were positive, suggesting they had previously had the coronavirus.In total, five children tested positive, either for active Covid-19 infection or previous exposure to the virus. A lack of antibody tests meant the other children were not tested for Covid-19, therefore it is not clear whether the true rates of Covid-19 in the children would have been lower or higher than discovered.Rebecca Unsworth, joint first author of the study, said: \u0027During the peak of the pandemic widespread access to testing wasn\u0027t available so we may have missed further cases of Covid-19 in these children who have new-onset type 1 diabetes.\u0027Children are believed to be just as likely as adults to catch the coronavirus. But they may be diagnosed less often because their symptoms are so mild. Testing for Covid-19 in the UK was limited only to adults until mid-May, several weeks after the peak of the pandemic. Children under five years old can now get a test but they would only come forward if they had symptoms. The study, published in Diabetes Care, also found that children in the study had high levels of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a serious condition that can happen to diabetics if their body starts to run out of insulin. When this happens, harmful substances called ketones accumulate in the body. It can be life-threatening if it\u0027s not found and treated quickly. Seventy per cent of children had DKA and 52 per cent had severe DKA. Four children were treated in intensive care. The authors cautioned this was a much higher rate than they would normally expect to see, and many children were very unwell.This supports anecdotal stories from doctors in England, according to Julian Hamilton-Shield, a professor of diabetes and metabolic endocrinology at the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the research. The researchers theorised that the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus may be able to attack and destroy insulin-making cells in the pancreas.The spike protein of the virus binds to ACE-2 receptors which coat some cells in the body. Therefore, the receptors are seen as the \u0027gateway\u0027 for the virus.ACE-2 is strongly expressed in pancreatic endocrine cells, the researchers said.  Scientists who were not involved in the study said the link warrants further investigation. Professor Paul Zimmet, at Monash University, and Francesco Rubino, King’s College London, recently expressed their concerns about a potential diabetogenic effect of Covid-19 in the New England Journal of Medicine. They commented today: \u0027The findings add to our concerns on a potential link between Covid-19 and diabetes.\u0027Early in the course of the pandemic we had become aware of similar reports of new cases of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes as well as other atypical diabetes manifestations in people with SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) infection. \u0027This has a biological rationale since the new coronavirus can bind to receptors that are highly prevalent in cells of crucial metabolic organs such as the pancreas, the adipose tissue, the liver and the intestine, which may explain also the fact that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes have been reported in association with Covid-19.\u0027 But Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the rise in paediatric type 1 diabetes could just be random.He said: \u0027It is often tempting but can be wrong to assume that whatever infection is common in the community is the cause of an increase in diagnoses that could have arisen just by chance. \u0027During any epidemic like the current one, people will be looking out for any change in the incidence of disease in their own practice that could be related to the epidemic pathogen.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Home Office books 4 000 hotel rooms asylum seekers","story":"Share this articleHome Office uses 4,000 hotel rooms to cope with migrants | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Stretched universities face overwhelmed level U turn","story":"Share this articleUniversities admissions chaos predicted as Oxbridge faces having to let down over 1,500 studentsUniversities left with no idea how to honour offers after A-level reversal | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/012b6b6880cc7974df5822df7559fa021bffce20/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ec23219e5295951bc102e3c3158f4c7","title":"the big picture shadow play in 1930s germany","story":"Paul Wolff’s 1930s images of a tennis match in silhouette have a graceful life of their ownIn 1930, Dr Paul Wolff took a series of pictures of tennis players’ shadows for the German magazine Die Dame. The pictures captured a whole tennis match in silhouette – serve, return, volley, forehand, backhand – so that the shadows advancing on the court took on a graceful life of their own, tethered to the ankles and feet of young men and women in ankle socks and white plimsolls. The relation of player and shadow – high summer’s constant doubles partners – has become a familiar theme for sports photographers, but Wolff was among the first to celebrate it.In the decade that followed, the German photographer and his assistant-cum-stage manager Alfred Tritschler became famous as “the masters of the Leica”, extending the range and scope of the pioneering hand-held camera, with work showcased in every major magazine and newspaper. The Leica company, which had given the former medical doctor one of its prototype 35mm cameras to experiment with in 1926, subsequently delivered all of its new lenses to Wolff in advance of release for him to create advertising images. A travelling slideshow of some of the results was watched by hundreds of thousands of people across the world.All of Wolff’s technical mastery coincided, of course, with the darkest days in his country’s history. Almost accidentally, he documented in his pin-sharp, perfectly lit way the end of the Weimar republic, the rise of nazism and the devastation of war. Wolff’s house in Frankfurt and his extensive personal archive were destroyed by bombing in 1944. A selection of the prints and negatives that remain has been collected into a book that includes not only his photographs of tennis players, but also early images of Hitler Youth, the launch of the Hindenburg zeppelin and the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Not for nothing is the book called Light and Shadow. Dr Paul Wolff \u0026amp Tritschler: Light and Shadow – Photographs 1920 to 1950, edited by Hans-Michael Koetzle (Kehrer Verlag), has been nominated for the Kraszna-Krausz 2020 Photography Book award.

Voices jostle with one another, Galway colloquialisms woven in with text speak and emojis, as a run-down hospital ward serves as a microcosm for contemporary Ireland.The narrator, Sinéad Hynes, a mother of three in her late 30s, has been admitted after collapsing. It’s eight months since she was diagnosed with terminal cancer, but she has put off telling her husband (and sons): “I thought it was a dreadfully selfish thing to do to another person, fill him up with worry and uncertainty, to try and make him figure out death.” Instead, she obsessively Googles drugs and cures and outcomes alongside the mundane business of daily life.But Sinéad is a master at hiding pain. There’s the stillborn daughter whose loss she can’t discuss with her husband, and the rural childhood with a bullying father whose voice breaks into her present in cruel, stream-of-consciousness monologues. From her bed she observes her ward mates deal with their own buried secrets. There’s Margaret Rose, the working-class matriarch recovering from a stroke but still organising her youngest daughter’s trip to England for an abortion (“Manchester would deal with the bother in the uterus. Like it had helped so many times before, with Irish women, rollie cases, taxis, coffees, airport toilets, sobbing, solitude, trauma, travel, Solpadeines, secrets”). There’s Hegs, the local politician who protests too much that he was never involved in backhanders and Jane, whose dementia has left her living half in the past with an abusive husband and memories of a tragic, forbidden love.The common denominator is a particularly Irish brand of shame, which still exerts its grip down the generations: “It was the most contagious thing inside and outside Hospital.” There are obvious comparisons with the lyrical writing of Eimear McBride Feeney’s voice is at once fresh and sharp, with an eye for the comedy of existential dread."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66061ac51770f1b45b2267e74f35bf287cfddf16/0_1081_6496_3898/master/6496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b4498246e94f9dd719d3a9659b55d3b","title":"spellbook forms part of exhibition of hebrew works at british library","story":"Show delayed by lockdown set to open at London library in SeptemberLike any good spell book it’s got all the important magical recipes how to escape demons, obviously, as well as safe travel, catching thieves, successful love-making, and the more mundane problems of how to overcome fever, diarrhoea and swallowing a bone.Now the small 16th-century spellbook containing 125 recipes is about to go on public display at the British Library as part of its delayed Hebrew Manuscripts exhibition.The library has a rich and wonderful collection of more than 3,000 Hebrew manuscripts and, before lockdown hit, completed a six-year project to digitise them.“It was an extremely demanding and challenging initiative, but we are so proud to have accomplished it,” said the curator, Ilana Tahan. “We wanted to celebrate that by exhibiting a selection of manuscripts, some of which have never been on public display before.”The plan was to open the show in March. It will open to members this week and to the general public on 1 September.About 40 manuscripts will go on display, dating as far back as the 10th century and ning science, religion, law, music, philosophy, alchemy and Kabbalah. And magic, of which the spellbook is a good example. “It is a charming little manuscript with 125 magic recipes. It is so sweet and has some beautiful decorations.”Among the spells is one “to increase love between bridegroom and bride”, which involves writing their names in honey on to two sage leaves and giving them each other to eat. “I dare anyone to try it,” said Tahan.To catch a thief, simply write the names “Kematin kanit kukairi ve-hikani yazaf” on kosher parchment and hang from the neck of a black rooster. Circle around suspects and the rooster will jump on the head of the thief.To make yourself invisible, burn the skin of a snake in March and sprinkle the ashes in your eyes. People can use those same ashes if you meet a king – simply hold in your hand and they will heed your words.And for a person who has swallowed a bone, the spell reads: “One who swallowed a bone, take a bone of the same kind and place it over his head without his knowledge, then whisper the following: nehash, nehash, har, har, mena’, mena’, tsa, tsa. And it is tested.”Another highlight of the show will be documents shining light on Moses Maimonides, a 12th-century Jewish philosopher who was born in Cordoba, Spain, and went on to become the spiritual leader of the Jewish community in Egypt, where he was physician to the sultan, Saladin. He was the greatest Jewish polymath leader of the middle ages, his name known across Europe.Thousands of Jews wrote to Maimonides asking for advice and legal rulings. The exhibition has a handwritten letter written by him in Arabic, but in Hebrew script, to a teacher who needed specific help.Tahan said the teacher taught two young girls in a remote Jewish community in Egypt. “For some reason, which is not quite clear from the documents – maybe somebody said something derogatory about him – he took an oath to stop teaching the two girls. In those times, when you took an oath, you stuck to it.”But the teacher felt the girls were missing out on an education, so he evidently wrote to Maimonides asking how to go back on the oath. He replied that the teacher needed to get three Israelite witnesses to cancel the oath. “He was always pragmatic. He always thought of how he could help someone and not put them through a very complicated process.”Also on display is the earliest dated (1380) copy of Maimonides’ Guide for the Perplexed, considered to be be his most significant philosophical work.The story of Maimonides also speaks to more harmonious times between Muslim and Jewish communities. “When Maimonides passed away, not only Jewish communities mourned him, but also all the Muslims in the city came to mourn him,” said Tahan. “He was known across Europe and across the three main faiths.”Other highlights include a letter written to Henry VIII by an Italian rabbi in 1530 regarding biblical laws that could support the king’s claim to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon.The opening of the Hebrew Manuscripts exhibition is part of the next phase of the British Library’s gradual reopening after lockdown.Also reopening on 1 September is the Treasures gallery, which includes objects ranging from Leonardo da Vinci’s sketchbooks to Andrea Levy’s working drafts for Small Island and The Long Song.• Hebrew Manuscripts 1 September-11 April 2021 at the British Library."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15921ab56dd29f3b7eb3dcf6c2b27fa2fa874afd/0_106_5003_3002/master/5003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cad6e01beeab55feebd639264962da2","title":"a level grades universities exams","story":"Exams are not a good measure of ability. But they certainly make life easier for higher education institutionsThe stories were heartbreaking the sense of injustice utterly profound. The government had little choice but to U-turn on its decision to use an algorithm to dish out A-level “results” to thousands of young people that had bafflingly little connection to their ability or the quality of their work. But in announcing this without setting out a plan for what it means for university admissions – some institutions will now be massively oversubscribed in terms of places, others undersubscribed – it has simply pushed the problem elsewhere.Step back, and this whole fiasco exposes some uncomfortable truths about how fair the system is normally, and the true extent of and limits to meritocracy. We take it as given that dropping a couple of grades in a one-off exam should amount to the be-all and end-all in determining which university you go to. Have a good exam day, and you could be attending the university of your dreams have a bad day and the anxious cycle of clearing starts. All this is predicated on the crazy idea that we need to avoid AAA students studying with ABB students, BBC students studying with BCD students at all costs or … what?Rankings allow illusions of meritocracy and simple choices to prevail – obviously we should go for the AAA student over the ABB one – when the reality is they may be covering up a choice that is more random and arbitrary than we may like to think.A-levels may be great at ranking the ability of students to take a particular exam on a given day. But how useful is that for predicting how well they will do at university, sometimes in an entirely unrelated subject? Or in any given job? There will be some link, but is it strong enough to justify a university system in which dropping a single grade can close off entry to your first choice?If exams aren’t perfect, perhaps there are other ways of assessing students. But the other options all come with their own problems. Teacher-based assessment tends to be biased against young people from disadvantaged backgrounds coursework can be a more accurate assessment of a teacher’s willingness to coach the work out rather than a student’s true ability. There simply is no such thing as a perfectly accurate method for ranking young people’s abilities that works for everything from university entry to job recruitment.That’s only bad news if we consider a failsafe assessment of a young person’s future abilities at the end of school as the alpha and omega of the education system. But why should it be? Why do universities and employers even need this in the first place?It’s only important for universities if we believe that it is paramount that the young person who gets BBC in their A-levels should not study alongside the young person who gets BCC: that they must to be sorted into different institutions. To see how bizarre this is look at the school system, where experts have shunned the use of academic selection in light of evidence that creaming off the most able children into separate schools does barely anything for their learning and simply worsens outcomes for everyone else.Yet for some reason, when it comes to post-18 education, we turn this on its head and go for extreme levels of academic stratification – which, because children from more affluent backgrounds are much more likely to attend good-quality schools, also produces a highly socially stratified university system. You get tutors worrying about whether a student has the ability to complete a course at their university if they’ve dropped a couple of grades, without ever wondering whether this says a whole lot more about the quality of teaching at their institution than the student in question. (It absolutely does.)This system works brilliantly for the most selective universities, who get to select the highest A-level performers who hail disproportionately from affluent backgrounds, then claim the kudos when – surprise, surprise! – those students go on to do well. But it also fuels unjustified elitism. Because universities essentially mark their own homework – a first from one university is not equivalent to a first from another – employers tend to use the university someone attended as a shorthand for their labour market potential, rather than the skills they actually developed there. The prophecy becomes self-fulfilling. We couldn’t design a better way to entrench privilege if we tried.Employers also deserve more scrutiny. Traditional recruitment includes screening CVs – with A-levels and degrees a key filter for entry-level jobs – followed by an interview. Not only is this method ineffective at selecting the best people for the job, it can be downright counterproductive. Experimental studies have shown that interviewers are notoriously unreliable at predicting someone’s capabilities. And interviews are a reliable way to smuggle bias into the process: interviewers tend to go for candidates that look and think like them, leading to less erse, more groupthink-dominated – and less successful – workplaces.One real-world example comes from Texas in the late 1970s, where a doctor shortage pushed politicians to instruct the state medical school to increase its admissions after it had already selected 150 applicants after interview. It took another 50 candidates who had been rejected at interview – after much of that pool had already been snapped up by other universities. Those 50 went on to perform just as well clinically and academically as the original crop: their success at interview made no difference at all they might as well have been picked from the shortlist at random.We don’t need A-level results to provide a high-stakes ranking. If we were more honest about the limits of meritocracy, we would move to a more comprehensive-style university system – where, like at school, young people of different abilities learn alongside each other, with real academic benefit. More large employers would disregard A-level grades and degrees, running aptitude tests and assessment centres to assess the skills relevant to their workplaces, randomly selecting from those candidates who make a cut-off to ensure a more erse intake than interviewing could ever allow. If this sounds pie-in-the-sky radical, the head of one Oxford College told me over the weekend she was interested in experimenting with ditching interviews and allocating places by lottery to students who get top A-level grades: a good start.We have extensively debated the fairness of an algorithm, but let’s not fail to ask why we even needed one in the first place. The real reason is that the system as it stands shores up elitism and maintains the grip that the upper middle class – for no good reason – has on influential jobs. But this weak attempt to fake meritocracy is a harmful pretence that denies too many young people a chance in the first place.• Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer and a  and Observer columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f26ab671f2627930e5577d56bcc8bb12e9aa597/0_418_4229_2537/master/4229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=869e0024b3e1dc6c1ab652d69ec46e88","title":"belarus alexander lukashenko election","story":"More than a week after a sham election, public rage has not died down“And what is it, what is it that they want  Centuries despised: those deaf, blind ones?  To be called people.” These words by Janka Kupala, Belarus’s national poet, published in the early 1900s, have come to mind in recent days as protests have rippled through the nation. Twenty-six years after Alexander Lukashenko came to power in the Republic of Belarus’ first and last democratic elections – almost immediately stripping the country of any ambitions to recover its national language, democratic process or historic myths and symbols after more than 70 years under the Soviet yoke – Belarus and Belarusians are seeing for the first time a fighting chance at meaningful politics and civic rights. Make no mistake, a people once described as the “dark, despised ones” (ciomny, pahardžany narod) have crossed a point of no return.I asked Olga about the protesters’ goals: “Everyone is united for the first time ever: left-leaning Belarusians and the more traditionalist-oriented opposition of the past. They are fighting for basic human rights, rule of law and the constitution.” Indeed, the aims of the current protests are both modest and all-encompassing: end violence, topple dictatorship, demand real election statistics and have the true president-elect, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, call for new, fair elections.Like Olga, many Belarusians have organised into neighbourhood-based groups on the basis of inidual polling stations (uchastki). Local observers demanded the posting of the non-falsified election results (international missions such as the ODIHR were not invited to monitor the election, supposedly due to the Covid-19 pandemic). In many cases, polling station workers could be spotted fleeing the scene. In at least one instance, they even pre-emptively locked the station, forcing Belarusians who had just voted to climb over closed gates.Still, a significant number of stations in Minsk and smaller areas posted the true results, suggesting a convincing victory for Tikhanovskaya. This moment of no longer perpetuating the totalitarian lie – to carry out the surprisingly radical act of telling the truth – is clear in one widely shared video of a polling station that captures the staffers posting the true election results. A middle-age woman tapes the results to the door of the uchastok building and smiles nervously through her mask, seemingly holding back tears and fear. She proceeds to hug the other workers to the cries of a crowd of Belarusians: “Job well done! Thank you!” Shaken, they can hardly comprehend what they have done.The digital component of the revolution mirrors the local protest cells that Olga and others describe. Groups and channels on the messaging app Telegram, run in part by central European news resources as well as popular bloggers, securely spread information, agitational posters and crucial protest guidelines, all while Lukashenko and his political machine have blocked off internet access across swathes of the country after the first nights of protests. Larger Telegram channels splintered off into local ones for grassroots organising, reminiscent of the wide net cast by Tikhanovskaya, Maria Kolesnikova and Veronika Tsepkalo during their campaign tour in the weeks leading up to last Sunday’s election.A number of sceptics in the west and countries in the region have been wondering whether Russia might simply come to Lukashenko’s aid if “little green men” portending annexation might soon appear as they did in the aftermath of Viktor Yanukovych’s ousting in Ukraine’s 2014 Maidan revolution. But the Maidan parallel is shaky at best. Belarus does not see a west-east split like its neighbouring Ukraine or even Poland. This is likely a good sign, because it means the vast majority of Belarusians – Russian and Belarusian speakers, conservatives and liberals alike – are united in their immediate anti-dictatorial goals. A powerful rallying cry has been accusations of “genocide against the Belarusian people”. Many evoke Belarus’s proud history of defiant partisans, likening the inhumane actions of the riot police to the Nazi occupation. If the Maidan revolution started as a movement envisioning Ukraine as a part of Europe, the Belarusian revolution-in-progress strives for the Belarusian people, having little to do (for now) with intended geopolitical allegiances.Speaking in a simple accessible language and limiting existing political and cultural ides, the new Belarusian opposition – with a female face – has been able to foment protests with a clear, palatable anti-state-violence and anti-police message. Growing from small night-time protests to general strikes and the gathering of several hundred thousand peaceful protesters during the day, they are already making Lukashenko squirm. Most telling was a message of solidarity with protesters made on Saturday by Belarus’s ambassador to Slovakia, Igor Leshchenya: “According to the constitution, the people of Belarus are the only source of power in the country.” With more representatives of Lukashenko’s regime – including state TV propagandists, police officers and politicians – choosing truth instead, the dictator’s end is almost certainly nigh.Belarus, perhaps for the first time ever, has a chance to become a “normal” European nation-state. Even under dictatorship, Belarusians have always placed themselves at the centre of Europe. This time, they finally stand a chance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9badd696cf7250b942409a58df622affc1797640/0_252_4335_2601/master/4335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abdc825d5e8a42f32c7f08197fa4b617","title":"children covid 19 english schools virus safe reopening","story":"New research suggests that children are at minimal risk, yet their education has suffered greatlyThis makes one thing clear: reopening schools after the summer break does not represent a significant Covid-19 risk to children and teenagers themselves. What is also clear is that, as the recent difficulties around A-level results have highlighted, the near complete shutdown of school in March, during the early stages of the pandemic, meant that children and young people have been disproportionately affected by the lockdown relative to their risk of disease.However, the more challenging question – and one that has been causing a headache for the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the government – is whether the full reopening of schools is a risk to the UK’s control of the pandemic.Here the science is less certain, but emerging evidence does suggest the risk is manageable, and of much less harm than keeping schools closed. Findings from the recent PHE study are an encouraging start – during the pandemic first wave children with flu-like symptoms (who of course should not be attending school anyway) are much less likely to be shedding the Covid-19 virus than adults. Also, even if young people infect their classmates, their classmates are unlikely to become unwell.But the greater concern is whether children and teenagers with no symptoms could be shedding it, unknowingly creating a pool of virus circulation responsible for infecting adult staff members and spreading it into new households. It is certainly true that many (probably most) childhood infections with the Covid-19 virus cause no symptoms. In an ongoing antibody study we have shown that up until the end of July, approximately one in 25 healthy 0- to 19-year-olds had experienced a Covid-19 virus infection, but under a third of these had any respiratory or flu-like symptoms. So, yes, there is a chance that students will attend school while being unknowingly infected with the virus.Just how likely this is has been the study of speculation this week based on unpublished data from a school-based, PHE swabbing study, with reports suggesting that very few children attending reopened primary schools at the end of the last academic year had detectable virus. Given the very limited reopening of secondary schools before the summer holidays the situation in teenagers is less certain. However reports from the Office for National Statistics have consistently shown that, even with schools closed, approximately one in 300 children and teenagers with no symptoms had the Covid-19 virus detectable on nasal swabs from April to July, similar to rates in those aged 50 and above.But having detectable virus is not the same as being infective to others. Here the experience of Sweden is useful: it has kept schools open for under 16-year-olds during the pandemic, and found that infection rates in teachers were no higher, and were often lower, than other occupational groups. Clearly many other variables could be at play here (teachers may, for example, be younger or healthier than the other occupational groups), but this does provide some reassurance that students are not efficient spreaders of coronavirus. The need for continuing surveillance and vigilance is highlighted by recent outbreaks such as the one at an overnight youth camp during June in the US state of Georgia (in which at least 260 of 597 attendees tested positive for Covid-19), however it is to be hoped that risk management within schools will avoid the “daily vigorous singing and cheering” that may well have contributed to this.As with many aspects of the pandemic, there is no perfect answer, but the opening of schools must be a priority for the coming academic year. Moving into autumn, as the effects of other lockdown-easing measures are felt, it is inevitable that the plan will coincide with an increase in Covid-19 cases. Equally inevitably this will be accompanied by calls to revert to a school shutdown. Fortunately the evidence base on which to make any such decisions is building by the day, and it is to be hoped that any further restrictions would only be used as a last resort, and only if there is clear evidence that they are of benefit.Children and teenagers have already had to sacrifice a significant amount of their education for an illness they rarely suffer from we now all need to remember our obligation to make their continued wellbeing and development our priority.• Matthew Snape is associate professor in paediatrics and vaccinology at Oxford Vaccine Group, University of Oxford Department of Paediatrics, and the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre he is chief investigator on the What’s the STORY (Serum testing of Representative Youngsters) study, evaluating the proportion of children and teenagers with antibodies against the Covid-19 virus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b0da356ed1c3942dae5fbd3a742c0ba332a35d6/0_167_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff0b719259a6663c74f267ea9fe6af82","title":"results u turn education","story":"The government’s A-level U-turn is welcome. But the roots of the scandal are in a two-tiered approach to schoolsAhead of GCSE results on Thursday, the government has announced all A-level and GCSE marks will be based on teacher assessments rather than the controversial algorithm. It is a welcome U-turn, although it does little to address the underlying issue. This was always a clear-cut matter of class: private schools uniquely benefited from the statistical model used to replace A-levels last week, increasing the proportion of students achieving top grades – A* and A – twice as much as pupils at comprehensives.You only have to see the heartbroken teenagers posting on social media to understand the pain of these past few days: working-class young people who had their dream future in front of them only to lose it because they live in the wrong postcode. These pupils deserved justice, the government is right to fix the system in England just as the devolved nations have pledged to.But it would be a mistake to treat this debacle as a one-off mistake that can be solved with a better grade calculator. The scandal is simply a blown-up version of the reality we’ve long known: working-class kids work hard and too often get tossed away, while private-school families buy their way in.Far from being wrong, the infamous algorithm in many ways succeeded in replicating the socio-economic bias that has plagued the education system for centuries. Or to put it another way: the educational inequality laid bare by the government’s incompetence is not a shock. It is business as usual.Just look at how the exam crisis is being discussed. The focus in much of the media has been on A* students missing out on a place at Oxbridge (perhaps in part because much of the media followed this route themselves) with barely any attention on working-class teenagers who hoped to go straight into employment or on the fact that the proportion of people awarded grade C and above fell most in deprived areas. Even the supposedly comforting claim that “exams don’t matter” is steeped in privilege. It is easy to say grades are irrelevant if you have parents with connections and a flat in London, but considerably harder if you’re at your local comp in a low-income town.During the pandemic, we have seen the class ide in education play out in new ways. Nearly two-thirds of private schools already had platforms for online learning in place before lockdown, compared with just a quarter of the most poorly funded state schools. While the wealthy have had laptops and reliable broadband to keep learning, the poorest children haven’t even had breakfast.Inequality does not typically come with fanfare. It isn’t usually a headline-grabbing scandal or a resignation matter. It is constant, accepted, hardwired into society. The exam fiasco is a shameful mess for which the government must make amends. But next year’s working-class pupils will deserve a fairer system too. Let the outrage last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5da49ac587c55fd293cfb2db66bc76e514190926/0_133_4084_2451/master/4084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a866445b726044c8d099c6712d55d1eb","title":"how have you been affected by the exam results u turn in england","story":"We would like to hear from young people, parents and teachers on how they feel about the scrapping of the standardisation modelThousands of students, parents and teachers are celebrating after the government made a spectacular U-turn on this year’s A-Level results, reverting to teacher-assessed grades.We want to hear from students who missed out on their first choice university due to the results they received last Thursday, but because of the U-turn have now met their offer.

And it makes sense for their employers, tooKyle Lawrence, 22, from Essex, is an apprentice at a logistics company, working to move clothes around the world. “We bring things in from east Asia and get everything booked into containers or on a plane,” he says. With the office closed and some ports shut, it’s perhaps a job you’d most expect to have been strongly affected by coronavirus. But he’s able to work from home and continue his learning via virtual workshops and webcam chats.Other apprentices are having similar experiences. Sophie Bettelley is an apprentice nurse with Northamptonshire health and care partnership. She’s glad to be able to continue doing phone consultations during the pandemic. Bettelley has been ringing people who are at high risk to check if they have access to food. “There’s a lot of pressure but it’s a privilege to be able to help,” she explains.Doing an apprenticeship can be a good way to weather the coronavirus downturn. Apprentices are recruited throughout the year, so if you’re not sure about university, there’s no harm taking your time and waiting to see what comes up. A lot of employers have furloughed their HR departments and as they start to come back on board, more jobs are likely to be advertised.But not all industries are secure and apprentices are employees, so they are subject to the same issues as other working people. Currently, those employed in the motor, retail and hospitality sectors are most at risk – though this doesn’t necessarily mean that they’ve been made redundant.According to David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, many companies will not be recruiting as many apprentices as normal. “We expect young people seeking apprenticeships to find it much more difficult this year, but are working hard to secure opportunities with employers,” says Hughes.With more than 100 universities now offering degree apprenticeships, Mark Dawe, CEO of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers thinks this could be the safe option. “A lot of these degree-level apprenticeship programmes are in the core of the business where they will still want to be recruiting,” he says.“Getting an apprentice is much better value to the business than someone coming in cold with a degree.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82e3c564aad2d1d0a50954fcd5f40ec210d79eda/0_245_4794_2876/master/4794.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f696528d1941b42607eecd278403697","title":"starting secondary school during a pandemic what parents need to know","story":"New year 7s will have missed out on rites of passage and been unable to visit their new school. But there are silver liningsThe good news – and more than good, in some ways it feels miraculous – is that 11-year-old Phoebe South is genuinely looking forward to starting secondary school in September. “I feel quite excited about it now,” she tells me, from a beach in Devon where she’s on holiday with her family. “I know one of my best friends is going to be in the same bubble as me, and I know quite a lot about what to expect.”That she feels this way is tribute to all the work of her new school, Wykham Park academy in Banbury, Oxfordshire, to prepare for the influx of year 7 students in a few weeks’ time. Transition to secondary school can be difficult in the best of years – and 2020 is far from that.“By this stage in a normal year the new year 7s would have been into school to look round for a couple of days,” says Justine Williams, senior assistant principal at Wykham, who leads on transition. “They’d have met their teachers, and they’d have met the other pupils in their groups. They’d have tried the food and found out where the toilets are, and their parents would have been in for a meeting and to hear about what to expect.”As much as possible of this has gone ahead – but online. “We had a virtual parents’ evening, we’ve made videos about the different departments, and we’ve even managed to film a student’s eye view of what to expect, all of which is on our website. We’ve set fun transition projects for the pupils to do in subjects like art and science, and we’ve tried to answer as many questions as possible ahead of term starting,” Williams says.In some ways, the new protocols in place for the pandemic may make life less stressful than usual for the new intake. “Our strategy this year is that pupils will stay in one area of the school, except for PE and sharp-tool subjects – so that may make it easier than usual as it means rather than pupils moving around 10 different areas in the school, they remain in one place and the teachers come to them,” says Williams.Looking for the silver linings, and remembering there is still lots to celebrate about starting at a new school, is key to making it work, says Deirdre Kehoe of Young Minds, the mental health charity, which has produced a guide to secondary transition.“Whether you’re a teacher or a parent, focus on what’s good about the current situation,” she advises. “Of course you’ve got to think about very practical things that are going to be different from usual – but this is such an important stage in a child’s life, and it makes a difference if we look forward to it and celebrate the rite of passage it represents.”Her advice is to concentrate on what is going to be the same as usual, rather than on what will be different. “They’ll still be travelling to school, still eating their packed lunches, still getting homework, still going to lessons.”In any classroom, two pupils on average have a diagnosed mental health condition – and on top of this there are children with other mental health challenges. Added to which, the pandemic has meant that many of them will have found it more difficult than usual to access help.This is why, says Kehoe, schools’ focus must be on wellbeing, especially for the first term. “They need to concentrate on getting used to their new school, and to making friends, without the level of pressure there might normally be on academic attainment.”Given that the new year 7 cohort didn’t get the chance to take their Sats, tests for academic ability will be more important than usual this year – but it seems most schools are taking a “softly, softly” approach. At Wykham Park, the usual reading comprehension tests will take place, “but not immediately – everybody needs to settle in first”, Williams says.Keziah Featherstone, head of a large Midlands comprehensive school, says she expects most schools will do some kind of assessment for year 7s – some formalised tests, others more discreet checks. “We’ll be doing both, and lots of settling in and feeling happy,” she says. “I think there’s a growing sense that we’ll be kind and nurturing but get back to learning routines as soon as possible.”Lynne Hipkin, a clinical psychologist working with school-age children, says the pandemic has underlined the role of teachers as key figures of stability and support. So getting back to normal in the classroom will be important for the wider society as well as inside schools, she says.She emphasises how important it is to keep children at the centre of what is happening. “Communication and curiosity are key: be guided by your child, be curious,” she says. “Keep an open mind – let them tell you what’s going on rather than anticipating how they feel.”Another crucial element, as pupils prepare to go back to school, is for teachers to remember that everyone’s experience of Covid-19 will have been different.“We’ve all been travelling through the same storm, but in very different boats,” says Hipkin. “How children feel about the new measures will vary very widely. Some will feel a much greater responsibility for safety and hygiene measures and be much more preoccupied with them, than others. Some will think things are basically OK, some will think they are far from OK.“What matters most is being conscious of what’s going on inside children’s heads as we go into the new term. Because this year, change is doubled: there’s the transition to secondary school, but also the transition back into school.”Dr Rina Bajaj, of the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, says experiences of the pandemic can be put to positive use. “Teachers in schools can talk to pupils about how they adapted to the lockdown, what helped them to get through. If they’re encouraged to reflect and build on their strengths and what they found out about themselves, they’ll learn things about resilience.”The Anna Freud centre has produced a guide, Managing the Transition Back to School, packed with tips. “Traditionally, the focus in schools has been on academic attainment – but growing up is also about how to engage with relationships and life,” says Bajaj. In this vein, it’s a good time for teachers and parents to make sure they’re role-modelling self-care, she says. “Young people watch us – they see us more than they hear us. We need to practice good stress management: we need to exercise, to take breaks, to eat well, to relax. And if we’re anxious we need to name that – because anxiety in some circumstances is normal.”On top of which, this year’s cohort will have missed out on so many of the rites of passage that should mark this stage of their lives: end-of-term parties, leavers’ assemblies, saying goodbye to primary school teachers. “All that didn’t happen for Phoebe, and she was really upset and confused by it,” says Naomi South, her mother. “So it was lovely when her new school started to do all the virtual preparation. It’s not been ideal, of course – but it has made her feel a whole lot better about what’s ahead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c53840a3d44fcb1766161a2f372574dbb730ed85/0_147_5475_3285/master/5475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27c847ef98e0643ad28549a461f17dcd","title":"from farm to factory the unstoppable rise of american chicken","story":"How industrial chicken farming transformed an ‘alternative’ meat to the most consumed meat in the USA century ago, Americans would not recognise our modern hunger for chicken. The year-long market for tender but relatively bland chicken meat is a newish phenomenon, and without it the idea of chicken cutlets, $5 rotisseries, or the McNugget would be a fantasy.How did America go from thinking of chicken as an “alternative” meat to consuming it more than any other meat?The story starts with corn.At the turn of the 20th century, chicken was almost always eaten in the spring. The priority for chicken raisers at the time was egg production, so after the eggs hatched, all the male birds would be fed up and then quickly harvested as “spring chickens” – young, tender birds that were sold whole for roasting or broiling (hence the term “broilers”). Outside the spring rush, you might be buying a bigger, fatter fryer or an old hen for stewing.“Farmers were sending chickens of all sorts of ages, different feather colours, and tremendous variety to the marketplace in the early 20th century,” says Roger Horowitz, food historian and author of Putting Meat on the American Table. But almost all chickens in the market were simply surplus to egg production, making them relatively uncommon – even rare. Tender spring chickens in particular could fetch a good price. But it is worth noting, Horowitz says, that the higher price wasn’t necessarily coming from pent-up demand.“It’s not as if consumers were clamoring for broilers,” he says. Though there was some consumer demand for chickens, the relatively high price for broilers likely had more to do with the limited, seasonal supply than a passion for poultry.During the second world war, however, red meat was rationed, and a national campaign encouraged the consumption of poultry and fish to save “meat” (beef, pork and lamb) for “the army and our allies”. Eating chicken became more common, but the preference for young broilers, and white breast meat, persisted. As the war drew to a close, feed millers, which buy and grind corn and other grains to feed livestock, saw a big opportunity to spur that demand for meat chickens, which consume large amounts of corn. When traditional banks refused to finance new-fangled “chicken farms”, the feed companies themselves offered farmers loans to buy feed and equipment, putting the pieces of the modern contract poultry system in place.Consumer acceptance of broilers out of season was not automatic. In the 1930s, the average American ate 10lbs (4.5kg) or less of chicken annually by 2017 that had risen to 64lbs (29kg), according to the Economic Research Service at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). For decades chicken battled to be seen as a “meat”, and did not surpass its most expensive competitor, beef, in terms of overall consumption until 2010. A strong USDA-funded marketing campaign helped out.“In the 50s and 60s, you see where these agricultural extension operations start pushing out recipes very aggressively about broilers,” Horowitz says, and as feed companies and hatcheries (most of which would eventually become so-called “integrators”, which own several of the businesses involved in chicken production) continued to consolidate the industry, they were able to more carefully calibrate the chicken itself to what would sell most profitably, focusing on lowering costs and raising proportions of the highest-demand cuts, namely breast meat.Don Tyson, the late president of Tyson Foods, famously said: “If breast meat is worth two dollars a pound and dark meat is worth one dollar, which would I rather have?” But for generations, the idea of buying just the most coveted cuts of chicken was foreign to most consumers. It wasn’t until the 1980s that preferences began to switch to cuts of meat over the whole bird.These companies owned and understood their chickens from egg to table and were able to exert unprecedented control over the biology of their flocks. Now, not only are they able to fine tune the birds’ characteristics with incredible accuracy, they can also map interactions with feed, environment, and processing to maximise profits.For integrators and corn farmers alike, the investment paid off. In 2019, 9.2 billion 6lb (2.7kg) broiler chickens were harvested in the US, consuming about 1.8lbs (820g) of grain for every pound of chicken.But the impact on chickens from the changes in production is troubling.Over the past 70 years, the poultry industry has measured its success in terms of how many pounds of meat a chicken can produce for a given amount of feed. Modern chickens are more efficient than ever, with producers able to calculate to the ounce how much “input” of food, water, air and time are required to get a set amount of white and dark meat.The modern chicken is fully industrialised.With more than 500 chicken breeds existing on Earth, it might surprise you to learn that every nugget, breast, and cup of chicken noodle soup you’ve ever eaten likely came from one breed, a specialised cross between a Cornish and a white  rock.The genetic lineages of chickens grown by the world’s biggest poultry companies are a closely guarded secret. But one common commercial line, the Cobb 500, originated from a contest held by the USDA’s Agricultural Extension Service in the 1940s, aptly titled the “chicken of tomorrow” competition. The winner, the Vantress chicken, would become the standard meat chicken by the 1950s. This chicken and its many descendants were optimised for a few key factors: large breasts, white feathers, fast and efficient growth, consistent sizes and gentle dispositions.The average size of a grocery store chicken in the 1920s was about 2.5lbs (1.13kg). Today it hovers around 6lbs (2.7 kg), which a broiler chicken can reach in about 47 days, according to the National Chicken Council (even younger, smaller birds are used for fast food restaurants).The use of naturally double-breasted breeds and millions of dollars in research has produced birds with massive breasts, but gaining that muscle mass quickly requires near constant food consumption, and leads the birds to have much lower activity levels. Growing pains lead to sedentary birds.White feathers are key for marketing, because pin feathers and follicles of birds with coloured feathers can hang on to pigmentation, and coloured bird carcasses don’t appear as “clean” or sell as well to picky consumers.Consistent sizing is required to ensure that slaughterhouse line speeds can stay high. Processing chickens is one of the biggest bottlenecks in getting chickens from farms to grocery stores, and consistently sized birds keep the machines running smoothly.Gentle dispositions are also a must as chickens are naturally aggressive and even cannibalistic, especially in confined spaces and large numbers. Poultry houses are more profitable the more birds are inside, so reducing the chickens’ natural disposition to fight and eat one another is key to facilitating modern poultry rearing. Faster-maturing birds also tend to be gentler, because aggressive behavior is more common among sexually mature chickens, a milestone most broilers never reach.With limited diets, these industrial birds can live semi-normal lifes, but if allowed to eat continuously, as they are genetically designed to, they tend to have extremely high mortality rates beyond the ideal harvest date. Counterintuitively perhaps, the industrialisation of chicken led to far fewer choices when buying poultry.“If you look at cookbooks in the 20s and 30s – for a certain kind of dish you get a fat chicken, for another you get a fryer or broiler. And the marketplace distinguished between those kinds of chickens,” Horowitz says. The industry’s obsession with perfecting the broiler machine came at the cost of the consumer’s ability to choose other varieties of chicken.As chickens became more commonplace in grocery stores, brands started to reintroduce variety by offering inidual cuts, skinless and boneless meats, and processed products (which also allowed them to improve the flavour, which had become decidedly bland over time). But as consumers’ interests trend away from more highly processed foods in search of story and connection to place, a niche may be opening for birds other than the Cornish cross.Growing food movements around the world are already spurring conversations about the possibility of making slower-growing chickens of different breeds, harvested at a larger variety of ages, more widely available. Even the company that grows Cobb 500 chicks is offering a new “rustic” variety with golden plumage, rather than the standard white. The conventional poultry industry may actually be poised to lead this trend, as it currently makes chickens of various sizes and ages available to institutional customers (fast food fried chicken, for example, is usually made from smaller, younger birds than are available in the grocery store).In the meantime, breeders and geneticists at the world’s largest poultry companies will continue refining their lines of Cornish cross broilers, in particular to grow quickly in harsh environments or on lower-quality feeds, conditions that might be more common in the developing world.“Instead of just selecting birds for maximum growth and size,” says Clauer, “now the genetic companies can look at 20, 30, 40 parameters and look very closely at the bird’s anatomy, health, structure, all the things that go into a modern bird that makes it much more efficient and have better liveability.”Though competition will likely come as technologies around lab-cultured and cell-based meats continue to progress and gain consumer acceptance, the sheer efficiency and short growth time of chickens is insulating the industry for now.Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a round-up of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

The quality seems variable, but we won’t know what we’re looking at until it is all in.”Good growing conditions over the summer, when about half the wheat harvest was brought in across the country, ended for many regions in the past week with severe thunderstorms following the mini-heatwave, which saw the longest period of temperatures over 34C (93.2F) since comparable records began in 1961.But the problems with the harvest started at the beginning of the year. While this spring was the sunniest since comparable measurements began in 1929, and substantially drier than usual, it followed the wettest February ever recorded. Storms Ciara and Dennis battered many regions of the UK in the early and middle of the month, causing widespread flooding, followed by Storm Jorge at the end.The ground was already wet in many areas, after a sodden winter, and the further downpours seen in February left many farmers unable to plant seeds and a poor start to the growing season for many. All of that was followed by a dry spring that meant germination was difficult and in many places delayed, Bradshaw told the .While there are unlikely to be any problems importing grain, as harvests have held up in other parts of the world, for many farmers it means a difficult end to the year after the disruptions of lockdown.Some grain farmers face an additional pressure: if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of the year, a tariff regime would spell disaster for farm exports. For that reason, many will want to sell their barley crop before the end of December, which may mean having to accept lower prices.“We have a known export market now, but there are then unknowns beyond January,” said Bradshaw.The lockdown affected some sectors far more than others. Dairy farmers were forced to throw away fresh milk that could not be collected, as the catering trade came to an abrupt halt and supply chains could not be immediately remodelled to redirect the production to retailers.People eating all their meals at home ate differently than they would normally: the milky cappuccinos and lattes demanded from coffee shops were out, and the steaks ordered in restaurants gave way to thrifty ways with mince at home. The latter caused particular headaches for meat producers, as normally they strive to “balance” the carcass between expensive and cheap cuts.Potato farmers saw farmgate prices halve, as the chip shop and catering trade disappeared overnight. Many farmers sought out innovative ways to market, from veg boxes to vending machines.Meanwhile, farmers who had ersified into offering accommodation and tourism, with children’s play areas or farm visits – as successive governments had encouraged them to do – have had a seesaw year. That side of their business broke down completely as lockdown prevented travel, but they are enjoying a late resurgence with staycations favoured over foreign trips.While the lockdown was a temporary measure, in the longer term farmers were being forced to grapple with the impact of the climate crisis, said Bradshaw. “What we are seeing is more extremes of weather,” he said. “Dry and wet weather seem to get stuck in patterns.”He pointed to the long drought of 2018, which made growing conditions difficult and left many farmers with a severe shortage of fodder for livestock. Last year, a wet autumn drenched the soil and caused flooding in many areas, destroying or delaying crops across the country.Aidan McGivern, a meteorologist at the Met Office, confirmed that the UK was experiencing a changing climate, with warmer and wetter winters, and rainfall coming in heavier bursts during summers. He said the season of summer thunderstorms – like those currently seen in the southern half of the country - was likely to extend in future from spring to autumn, and heatwaves would become more common.“When we experience a summer heatwave, it is more extreme than in the past,” added Mark McCarthy, the head of the National Climate Information Centre at the Met Office. “Climate change also increases the intensity of rain fall during the summer months, and heatwaves are followed by convective downpours. The challenge is knowing how to manage that.”In future, farmers might have to look at growing different crops, said Bradshaw. Maize and even soya beans might become an option, where previously they were rarely seen in the UK.Farmers were also looking to improve their own land management to account for a more variable climate, he added. “There has been more focus on soils, how they can store more water to be more resilient,” he said. “And we are looking at more spring crops to spread the risk across the year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/240a9cc5f1e099078699ba90f8cd3f54f44275c1/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d9bd6e1d8132d134cf17ee61f5e84cb","title":"ronald koeman to be appointed new barcelona manager","story":"Barcelona are set to announce Ronald Koeman as their new manager after Quique Setién was sacked on Monday evening, having lasted just six months in the job.“The board of directors have agreed that Quique Setién is no longer the first-team coach,” an official statement said. “This is the first decision within a wider restructuring of the first team which will be agreed between the current technical secretary and the new coach, who will be announced in the coming days.”That coach is set to be Koeman, who is expected to leave his role as Netherlands coach and take over as Barcelona manager later this week.

Koeman is understood to have been offered a two-year contract but there will be presidential elections in March after the cloub announced they had been brought forward. His continuity would be in the hands of whoever succeeds Josep Maria Bartomeu as president and the leading opposition figure and the favourite to win, Víctor Font, has made it clear that if he is elected his manager would be Xavi Hernández.Bartomeu’s preference has been the former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino and he had been backed by Ramón Planes and Eric Abidal, in charge of the technical secretariat. But it is likely that Abidal, the fourth sporting director that Bartomeu has had, may also be sacked in the coming days and other board members urged the president to rethink owing to Pochettino’s identification with city rivals Eyol.Pochettino had previously said he would prefer to go and work on his farm in Argentina than manage Barcelona, although he distanced himself from that remark in an interview with El País last week, insisting: “you never know.”Faced by pressure from his directors, some of whom have called for him to walk away amidst the crisis and pave the way for new elections immediately, Bartomeu called Koeman to take over. On Sunday night, he departed the Camp Nou and admitted that Setién was “out” and a 14-person board meeting – eight of them at the Camp Nou, six joining online – ratified that decision the following morning although there was still no announcement by mid-afternoon.The board also discussed the post of sporting director, the restructuring of the squad, with mass departures necessary before any signings can be made, and the possibility of bringing forward presidential elections – with early 2021 among the options. Bartomeu does not plan to face the media but a statement is expected shortly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31b51417ea869ca6fdaa09d180d68a0c5113c432/1_0_2416_1451/master/2416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cec489095df58c6a5bbcdb7c44d04e0","title":"dayot upamecano rb leipzig psg potent strike force champions league","story":"Young French defender is also an astute force in launching attacks as RB Leipzig hope for Champions League upsetWhat a scrumptious irony it would be if, after years of domination in Ligue 1, Paris Saint-Germain were to be thwarted in Europe by a French opponent. Lyon could sicken them in the Champions League final but that is unlikely, not least because it depends on Lyon getting past Bayern Munich in Wednesday’s semi-final. A more plausible scenario, however, is PSG being frustrated in the other semi-final by Dayot Upamecano, the Frenchman who leads RB Leipzig’s defence.Upamecano was born and raised in Évreux, Normandy, where his childhood playmates included Ousmane Dembélé, now of Barcelona. Unlike Dembélé, Upamecano, who is 21, has yet to be capped by France even though he has long been identified as a top talent.Manchester United may not be where they are today if they had managed to convince him to sign when he was 16: after being shown around Old Trafford in 2015 the defender was on the verge of moving to England but changed his mind at the last minute, when his parents decided he would be better off at Red Bull Salzburg, from where he joined Leipzig 18 months later.Although Upamecano was much bigger than his peers in his early teens and could bulldoze his way past opponents if he pleased, what really made him stand out was his finesse and intelligence. Those are the virtues that help make him such a commanding performer.In the quarter-final victory over Atlético Madrid he subdued his rivals while perpetrating only one foul – no mean feat when confronted by Diego Costa – but he also did much more than that. At Leipzig, to a greater extent than at most clubs, leading the defence also means launching attacks. Upamecano’s astuteness and his ability to open up opponents with dribbles and passing make him far more than a powerful stopper: he is an influential conductor.This is where the PSG-Leipzig match becomes so fascinating. There is little chance of Julian Nagelsmann doing a Pep Guardiola and suddenly sticking a straitjacket on his attack-minded team. So Upamecano and his fellow defenders will be encouraged to dash and probe as much as ever. Which will either hurt PSG or play right into their hands.With their own 21-year-old sensation, Kylian Mbappé, close to full fitness after an ankle injury, Ángel Di María back from suspension and Neymar in refulgent form and no doubt eager to shine even brighter in the wake of another wan surrender by Lionel Messi and Barcelona, PSG can start with awesome firepower.Mbappé’s speed will prove a particularly destructive weapon if PSG can beat Leipzig’s dynamic and clever press-swarm. Di María and, especially, Neymar can provide the ammunition from almost anywhere, as well as striking themselves. On the counterattack PSG could wreak havoc.The hardest part for PSG will be getting the ball to their attackers. Although Mbappé and Di María will return to the frontline, injuries have weakened them further elsewhere. The excellent schemer Marco Verratti resumed training on Sunday after calf trouble but casting him back into the action against opponents as vibrant as Leipzig is a risk Thomas Tuchel is unlikely to take.Same story for Idrissa Gueye, who is valued by the manager for his ball-winning prowess but suffered a muscle strain in training over the weekend. The most likely replacement for Gueye is Leandro Paredes, who is not as good at winning the ball as the Senegalese but, on the plus side, tends to use it better.PSG have a bigger worry at the back, since their goalkeeper Keylor Navas has been ruled out by the thigh injury that forced him off in the 79th minute of the quarter-final win over Atalanta. That win would not have been possible if Navas had not made a couple of excellent saves to keep the score down before PSG’s late comeback.The experienced Costa Rican will be replaced by Sergio Rico, who hardly imagined starting in a Champions League semi-final when he left Fulham after emphatic relegation from the Premier League 15 months ago.Rico is on loan at PSG from his hometown club of Sevilla, where he was once considered to be a future great and played in the triumphant 2015 Europa League final. But Sevilla lost faith in him after several costly mistakes, which is why he wound up at Fulham. PSG believe his class remains and, when he makes what will be his sixth start since joining last year, the goalkeeper is likely to be given plenty of opportunities by Leipzig to prove his worth.The first Champions League semi-final is not going to be boring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c1ce18e5de4c668fa6daf7b97459bcd97b59e62/0_143_4282_2569/master/4282.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2bbd8e8241a87d2c2e570a07c78a09c","title":"womens champions league last eight team guides no 3 barcelona","story":"The Catalans had a superb season under Lluís Cortés and have kept the squad together, including star forward Jenni Hermoso When the Spanish league was interrupted by the coronavirus crisis in mid-March, Barcelona were having their best ever season. The team had won 19 out of 21 matches, as well as the Supercopa and had qualified for the Copa de la Reina semi-finals and WCL quarter-finals. Once the season was officially cancelled, Barcelona were awarded the league title, their first since 2015.So what made Barcelona finally click this year? Well, the coach Lluís Cortés has managed to unify the team, creating a cohesion that had been missing in previous years. This version of Barcelona still likes to control the game and to keep possession, but its dominance comes from the group’s togetherness and hard work. Under Cortés, the team has kept their signature 4-3-3 formation but has added an extra layer of freedom to allow players to express themselves.This summer, the club has focused on maintaining the current group of players that had achieved such great results during the season. “The team is in very good shape, physically, technically and tactically. It’s an advantage that we’ve kept the core of the team and we are very prepared to work hard and give it our all during the pre-season so that in a month we’ll be in the best possible condition,” Cortés said before pre-season started last month.Barcelona’s main concern right now is whether Marta Torrejón, the team’s first choice at right-back, and Ana Maria Crnogorcevic, her natural substitute, will have recovered from the injuries they sustained during pre-season come Friday’s all-Spanish showdown with Atlético Madrid. If not, Barcelona B player Jana Fernández, 18, will be asked to step in to what would be her European debut.There has not been a huge upheaval at Barcelona this summer, which perhaps is not that surprising considering their successful 2019-20 season. The club has focused on maintaining the squad by extending contracts as well as giving promising Barcelona B players Jana Fernández and Bruna Vilamala their first professional deals.The main new face this summer is Giovana Queiroz, a 17-year-old Brazilian attacker from Madrid CFF with impressive speed and technical abilities. Barcelona also have the goalkeeper Cata Coll available after a loan spell with Sevilla last year.Lluís Cortés had a wealth of experience in women’s football before joining Barcelona. He became the team’s head coach in 2019, following the departure of Fran Sánchez, and has since won 46 out of the 53 games the team has played. Cortés’s main focus is to get the best out of every player so they can fit into the overall tactical plan, a code he has finally cracked this season and hopes to maintain throughout next season. “From the first day, the goal has been to maintain the core that has worked so hard for us. It’s an incredible group of people,” Cortés said during the pre-season.Jenni Hermoso is the league’s top scorer with 23 goals and the standout player. Usually a false nine or attacking midfielder, Hermoso plays her best when given the freedom to rove around and create chances in between oppposition lines. She won her first title with Rayo Vallecano, and played at Tyresö FC in Sweden for a year before signing with Barcelona in 2013. She left Catalonia in 2017, but returned in 2019, after two one-year spells at PSG and Atlético Madrid.Spanish defender Mapi León is well known for her many tattoos but she’s also a talented artist. She has designed many of her own tattoos and is often asked to design for others too. Mapi loves drawing and has plans to turn her passion for tattoos into a career as a tattoo artist when she retires.A few months ago, Jana Fernández making her debut in the Champions League this summer seemed unlikely, but recent injuries to Marta Torrejón and Ana Maria Crnogorcevic’s could force Cortés to look at the B team to find a replacement at right-back. Fernández is a World Cup winner with Spain’s Under-17 team has come through the Barcelona youth system. If Torrejón and Crnogorcevic are not available against Atlético on Friday, all eyes will be on her.The team may be better prepared than ever, but Barcelona’s lack of changes in personnel this summer can be a weakness as well as a strength. On Friday, they’ll face a revamped Atlético team that know Barcelona well, but who have been forced to cancel training because of five positive Covid-19 tests. If they win, the matchup against an experienced Wolfsburg side will be a real test for the Blaugranas, but one that they are better prepared for this year. With some luck, Barcelona should aim to repeat last year’s feat and make it to the final.Barcelona have been taking part in the WCL since its debut in 2012-13, qualifying for the quarter-finals for the fifth consecutive year. Their best result came last year when they made it to the final after beating Bayern Munich in the semis. They lost the final 4-1 to Lyon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/097db7a1b73ea2bdcb6b46ca1fbadeb355ba589b/394_511_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1159b109439f3e57d5019496b86571d5","title":"microsoft flight simulator review asobo","story":"PC (version tested)Xbox One (coming soon) MicrosoftAsoboThe perfect lockdown antidote: get in a plane and see New York, or the Amalfi coast, or the Himalayas, in eye-searing detail When the original Microsoft Flight simulator was released almost 40 years ago, it was very much for enthusiasts only. Early home computers could barely cope with drawing cockpit instrument panels, let alone scenery – so what you saw as you fought with the controls was a lot of dials and numbers, usually followed by an on-screen message politely informing you that you had crashed during take-off.This is not the experience you will have with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Developed by French studio Asobo using accurate geographic data culled from Bing Maps, a global cloud computing network, and real-time weather information, this is as much a visual spectacle as it is a simulator. And you will want to see as much as you can, because at 10,000 feet, the world looks spectacular (especially on the Ultra graphical settings, where it’s almost photorealistic). From craggy snow-topped mountain ranges to swooping desert valleys to bustling cities, the landscape is alive with detail.Without a moment’s airborne experience, you can access the world map on the introduction screen, pick a position and be dropped into a plane flying far above it. With all the many helpful assist options switched on, you can pilot your craft via joypad alone, your only concerns being altitude and air speed. Beneath you, a re-creation of the entire planet rolls by, so large that it would take 14 years of continuous play to see it all. One day, you may catch early morning sun beams rising along the Alps like searchlights, on another, you’ll see New York transform into a constellation of pin-prick stars as dusk drops and office lights take over every flight, a kind of holiday.But this is not a superficial flight sim. Far from it. Start switching off the automatic help, take control back from your AI co-pilot, and you have a rigorous, uncompromising simulation. Every flight is proceeded by lengthy engine and equipment checks and a 10-minute taxi to the runway take-off and landing are precise and demanding logistical exercises and flight paths are rigorously planned and adhered to. Eight tutorial flights provide a sense of the complexity to come, introducing the physics of flight and every instrument you’ll need to maintain it. You will learn how to use the yoke, trim and throttle, how to manoeuvre around an airfield, and how to get from one place to another using VFR navigation.And although you may start out crazily barrel-rolling a tiny Savage Cub propeller plane over Seattle, you will progress to piloting a Boeing 747-8, cruising at 35,000 feet, conversing with air traffic control, keeping a close eye on the beautifully replicated control panels, checking for warning lights. As fans of driving games such as Euro Truck Simulator have discovered, there is a sort of zen in simulated long-haul travel, a joy in mastering your role as driver or pilot so that it feels like you’re doing almost nothing – especially when you can pick out real-life scenic details en route.There are moments when the simulation falters. I’ve encountered areas of scenery where trees give way to acres of flat, low-resolution textures, which look ugly and out of place and although around 400 world cities have been accurately replicated using photogrammetry, others have been constructed using Bing Maps and AI, so that they resemble Lego-like model villages. Disappointingly, London is one of these, and its landmarks are blockily represented as a result. No doubt Asobo will be adding further to its list of fully replicated cities it is also allowing third-party modelling and simulation specialists to create and distribute their own city models using an in-game marketplace, so users will be able to populate their worlds with favourite locations (at extra cost, of course). But still, Flight Simulator is a true marvel and an astonishing use of Microsoft’s technological resources.In his wonderful book Skyfaring: A Journey with a Pilot, Mark Vanhoenacker writes, “Aeroplanes raise us above the patterns of streets, forests, suburbs, schools and rivers. The ordinary things we thought we knew become new or more beautiful, and the visible relationships between them on the land, particularly at night, hint at the circuitry of more or less everything.” This is what Flight Simulator aspires to. During an early session in a Cessna 152, your instructor tells you that she wants to teach you the mindset of a pilot: you will certainly develop a fresh understanding of space, time and motion.There are specific flight challenges and missions to try out, and even a global scoreboard where you can match yourself against other pilots, but you never have to do any of this. You can merely pick a departure point and a destination, and fly along the Amalfi coast, or up over the Ural mountains you can cross the Atlantic, the Irish Sea or Lake Wakatipu. Wherever you go, this game captures the wonder of flight, and the spiritual and emotional rush of seeing the world in a different way.• Microsoft Flight Simulator is available now, free with Xbox Game Pass for PC or £60 (standard edition)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df1f6cae4aa30ad66dae5f17aa41a79fccca8945/0_187_1368_821/master/1368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24da72c75293e2b5ba43b34aa824b61f","title":"how we met he just grabbed me and gave me a big snog","story":"Lynn and Kim Davies, 53 and 54, found love on stage after their characters shared a kiss. They live together in a small Worcestershire villageLynn Davies moved to Worcestershire from Bristol in October 1999, trading in city life for a country village. “I was working as a freelance television writer. I wanted the chance to explore a rural lifestyle and find a real community,” he says. He had only been there for a few days, when a shopkeeper suggested he go to the village hall for a drama club meeting. He didn’t realise until he got there that it was an audition for a play.When he arrived, he spotted Kim Cresswell, who worked as a housekeeper at a country estate and had joined the group to meet new people. “I thought she was striking. But I couldn’t start chatting someone up the minute I’d arrived.” He submitted a form to join the group, and Kim noticed that he had trained at Lamda, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. “I thought: ‘Right, we’re having him. We won’t see anything like that in this village again.’”Before they knew it, they had both been cast in the play. “I’m not sure we’d even exchanged names before we had to rehearse this scene together,” Lynn recalls. It was a romantic scene, where the characters kissed. “He just grabbed me and gave me a big snog,” laughs Kim. “The characters clearly liked each other so I figured we should probably do it properly,” Lynn adds.Later that evening, there was a party and the pair got chatting. They snuck into the village hall kitchen to share a bottle of wine. “I knew by the end of the evening that I was going to marry him,” says Kim. “I told my best friend and she said I was utterly mad. I had to take him to see her so she could make sure he was good enough.” Luckily, Lynn aced the interview.The couple took things slowly over Christmas and began dating properly in the new year. By March 2000, Lynn had moved into Kim’s house, where she lived with her five-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. “They adored each other from the start. On one of the first nights he put her to bed, I remember them getting out her drum kit. I had to laugh,” Kim says.They married in September that year on Iona, a remote island in Scotland. “Lynn suggested it and I thought: ‘Why not?’ It was organised over the phone.” They didn’t tell anyone about the wedding, but persuaded the local vicar and his daughter to travel up to perform the ceremony. “We asked the landlady and landlord of the bed and breakfast we stayed at to be our witnesses. It was just us, them and a tourist who was visiting the church at the time,” says Lynn.They took pictures on the beach before heading out for a meal together. “We wanted a small private wedding and Iona is an incredibly spiritual place,” says Lynn. Kim trusted his judgment. “I’d never been on any adventures before we met and now we’ve had so many.”The couple say they complement each other well. “I’m a country mouse and he’s a town mouse,” Kim says. “I’ve introduced him to all the community activities he came looking for, and he holds my hand when we go to the city.”Over the years, they have been involved in many small productions, from village plays to special events like the local asparagus festival. Although they don’t perform together as much now, they still share a love for drama. “We go out to different historical sites and always end up raiding the dressing-up box,” says Kim. “We just enjoy taking silly pictures and having fun together.” They also try to travel to Iona every year for their anniversary.Lynn supported her recent career change, and Kim now works for a mental health crisis line. “He makes me laugh all the time,” says Kim. “And I’ve learnt more from him than I ever did at school. He’s pushed me to be better and I owe him a lot.” Lynn describes his wife as the most thoughtful person he has ever met. “She’s the only thing that keeps me sane. We don’t have to do anything to be happy together.”• Want to share your story?

It’s been a sanctuary to return to from countless trips around the region, a place where the rigours, and sometimes dangers, of Iraq, Syria, Libya and elsewhere could be set aside for a while.In Lebanon, I could get things done. For all its faults, it’s a can-do place, where resourcefulness has got its people through. And it’s needed to be. Almost nothing works as it’s supposed to here: just getting by requires the spirit of an entrepreneur and a handyman.Few of the things we would take for granted elsewhere – electricity, clean water, waste disposal, the internet – are a given here. I’ve become proficient at each, just as I have in overlooking the country’s profound flaws. The dysfunction that underwrites Lebanon is part of the pact of living here. But no one could have guessed that it would end up destroying Beirut – literally.The explosion that thundered through the city on 4 August was clearly not normal. Since the end of the civil war, there had only been a few explosions here – car bombs that assassinated people. But this cataclysmic event was of a different magnitude. Whole streets of buildings were wrecked the closer to the port, the greater the chaos. I’d experienced explosions in Baghdad, Aleppo, Gaza, Mosul and southern Lebanon, but always during war and never on this scale. What on earth had just happened?As the dust cleared that fateful night, as the cascading of glass from high-rise towers slowed, the panicked aftermath of the blast turned to cold anger this had probably been very preventable. It wasn’t a hostile act, but a disaster borne of staggering incompetence and indifference to the welfare of the city’s residents.Nearly 3,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, one of the more lethal explosive compounds, had been stored in a shed at the entrance to town for six years. Within days of the blast, we learned that fireworks had been kept in the same shed, and a welder may have started a fire that ignited it all.The chain of events was unfathomable, as was the sheer scale of the damage. All the places where my formative memories of Beirut took shape were destroyed. Many of the people who helped shape them were wounded, some of them badly. I’ve made a career in the Middle East trying to keep a dispassionate distance from the events I’ve covered and people I’ve met. But that nominal barrier didn’t apply this time. This was personal.Everything that had blighted Lebanon – the corruption and incompetence of its leaders, the indifference of officials, nepotism, non-state actors, the widespread abuse of power – had come together in an apocalyptic storm that had shocked the world. How on earth could it have been allowed to happen?More than a week later, a broken city is still wrestling with the aftermath, as it is with the truly existential question of whether a functioning country can emerge from the ruins. Paying for the damage is beyond the capability of a bankrupt state already brought to its knees by three decades of industrial-scale corruption.International aid will help with the first stages of recovery. Life will go on for the Lebanese who decide to stay, or can’t leave. But what sort of an existence will it be here? If this isn’t the impetus to put the state on a more credible and sovereign footing, could anything succeed in turning things around?My house is repaired (I was 1.2 miles from the centre of the explosion), as are those of friends and colleagues who were closer to the port. If there is a “normal” left in Lebanon, I’m somewhere near it. But life here is unsettling now, more so than at any point in Lebanese history this is the moment of reckoning.I moved to Istanbul from Beirut 18 months ago, and I’ve been back a few times since. Every trip it’s been obvious how quickly Lebanon is sinking into intense poverty because of the financial crisis. It’s been sad to watch it unfold from afar. I was actually supposed to be travelling to Beirut for the first time since Covid-19 lockdowns lifted the week of the explosion anyway, and had already braced myself to see a much changed country. I didn’t expect to be frantically making phone calls and sending messages to check on the whereabouts of friends in the aftermath of one of the most powerful explosions ever recorded.When you’re flying into Beirut, one of the easiest landmarks to spot from the plane is the port, with its giant grain silos towering over the eastern, Christian side of the city. I used to use it as a marker to figure out where my old apartment was from the air. The night after the explosion, the whole docks area was ablaze with rescue teams’ floodlights, and the hipster-ish neighbourhood of Mar Mikhaël behind it – my old home – lay in total darkness. It was surreal.It truly is difficult to comprehend the scale of this disaster. A friend showed me the remains of his flat and I couldn’t understand how he was still alive. The first apartment I lived in in Beirut, 900 metres from the port, was blown to smithereens. Luckily, my elderly neighbours were not home at the time.The speed with which teams of volunteers from all over the country mobilised to help those whose homes were affected is a true testament to the kindness and generosity of ordinary Lebanese people. Their dedication to helping out neighbours and strangers alike stands in stark contrast to the non-existent clean-up effort from the state. More than once I saw groups of police and soldiers standing by, looking on as citizens did all the work.One thing that will probably stick with me – and all Beirutis – forever is the sound of broken glass, absolutely everywhere, all the time: falling from tower blocks and skyscrapers being swept or bulldozed out of half a city crunching under your shoes like fresh snow.It’s one thing to report in war zones and dangerous places when you’ve made careful calculations about risk and you know what to expect when you arrive. Scenes of devastation akin to Syria or Iraq in a place you considered as home, and as safe, is heartbreaking in a different way. The people of Lebanon deserve so much better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2cb4e5c5b17394e4b3319872121a2950a617fad/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc28e4147c8f4baa8e33313281966f3d","title":"dr martens for life pledge has left me worn out","story":"I spent £145 on a pair because they agreed to repair or replace them – but I can’t claimIn 2016 I purchased a pair of Dr Martens shoes under its “for life” scheme, whereby it agreed to repair or replace worn-out DM shoes.

They are now considering applying to court for legal papers to be released and could invoke a clause in the Scotland Act 1998 which allows Holyrood to compel the disclosure of government documents and to compel witnesses to appear.The committee inquiry will start hearing oral evidence on Tuesday by calling Leslie Evans, the Scottish government’s permanent secretary, who oversaw a botched internal inquiry into two historic sexual harassment complaints against Salmond launched in early 2018. Salmond denied the allegations.Salmond sued the government in August 2018, accusing it of breaching natural justice by failing to allow him a proper chance to defend himself. He won the case after government lawyers admitted in court in January 2019 the inquiry had been mishandled, and called for Evans to resign.Evans will give evidence under oath, and has insisted on bringing with her the Scottish government’s most senior solicitor. Salmond, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon, and her husband, Peter Murrell, the chief executive of the Scottish National party, are due to appear before the committee later this year.The committee will also investigate Salmond’s allegations that Sturgeon’s close aides and civil servants orchestrated a witch-hunt against him – a charge Sturgeon has rejected.Those allegations intensified during Salmond’s subsequent court appearance on 14 charges of alleged sexual misconduct, including an attempted rape, although the Holyrood inquiry will avoid any discussion of those allegations or the evidence heard during the trial.Salmond was acquitted on all charges by a high court jury after his lawyer alleged there had been a conspiracy involving some of the 10 women involved in the case, senior figures in the Scottish government and the SNP.In a letter published on the eve of the Evans hearing on Tuesday, Swinney rejected the committee’s repeated demands for release of legal papers and internal reports on the original harassment inquiry, claiming the documents were legally privileged.Swinney added that ministers could not release reports or notes from civil servants who investigated the first two complaints against Salmond. Ministers would, however, support an application to the court to release its submissions to the judicial review taken by Salmond in 2018.Swinney and Evans also insist civil servants cannot be expected or compelled to offer opinions on what happened, claiming that would breach the civil service code. MSPs on the committee believe that is an attempt to muzzle officials, and have warned Evans and Swinney they will use their parliamentary powers to ensure transparency.Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, and a committee member, said: “It is so disappointing that the Scottish government, having promised cooperation and transparency at the start of this process, now appears to be turning its back on that pledge.”Alex Cole-Hamilton, for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, added: “This committee must get to the bottom of a series of events that has cost Scottish taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds and left the Scottish government deeply embarrassed.“The committee has already faced challenges over securing documents and statements from persons of interest. That evasiveness does not serve the people of Scotland well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da9ee63afc093ae28b02f36078feab2359dce443/0_128_5501_3303/master/5501.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811650b473e982c2626c7ee5c1616f1a","title":"covid 19 behind the app the ethics of digital contract tracing part 1 podcast","story":"As a trial of the revised English coronavirus app gets under way, many of us will be watching closely to see what it can and cannot do, and whether it could help to contain Covid-19.

Harding, an ex-chief executive of the TalkTalk mobile phone company, is already the chair of the regulator NHS Improvement as well as the contact-tracing programme that is under fire for tracking down too few people who have tested positive for the virus.“Given Dido Harding’s track record overseeing the set-up of England’s sub-par test-and-trace system, many people will be worried to hear that she may be given a pivotal new role in the NHS,” said the Liberal Democrat MP Munira Wilson, the party’s health, wellbeing and social care spokesperson.“We need to have total transparency in how appointments of this kind are made, to ensure we get the best people for the job.“Rather than focus on promoting yet another Tory insider, the government would do well to reflect on their handling of this pandemic and launch an independent inquiry to ensure we don’t repeat past mistakes.” Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic\u0026nbsplike the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbspsays it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country.Harding will be named as the interim chair of the new institute – a merger between PHE and test and trace – and will steer it through its first few months as it seeks to improve the testing and tracing of people who may have coronavirus. Speaking in central London on Tuesday, Hancock will laud it as a combination of PHE’s expertise and test and trace’s capacity to track down large numbers of carriers and their contacts.“It must be able to operate with full transparency in order to advise the government, inform the public and do its work, which is so vital to the health of the nation.”Another Tory peer, Lord Prior – a former MP and ex-deputy chair of the Tory party – has been the chair of NHS England, which runs the health service, since 2018.Meanwhile, the  also understands that Duncan Selbie – PHE’s chief executive – will become an adviser to the Department of Health and Social Care after losing his job in a shake-up that has been heavily criticised by doctors and public health experts.The Royal Society for Public Health has voiced its concern about the axing of PHE. “We question the timing of an announcement to scrap our national public health agency, in the midst of a global pandemic and before any public inquiry has started, let alone reported,” said Christina Marriott, its chief executive.“We recognise that there have been some serious challenges in terms of our response to Covid-19, including the timing of the lockdown, the ongoing ineffectiveness of tier 2 track and trace and postcode-level data previously not being available to directors of public health,” she added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67273fa54fb4dd16633c4ce1f167ba1c1998a841/141_196_4243_2546/master/4243.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ae0135caac995f53cb83419dd902507","title":"so much heat about so little light frustrating test to a close england pakistan","story":"Questions remain over whether umpires, players and even groundstaff are doing enough, but bad light is an easier problem to shout about than it is to solveTick tock. Umpire Richard Kettleborough glanced at his watch. It was 3.19 in the afternoon. In front of him, Zak Crawley had marked his guard and, behind him, Mohammad Abbas was standing at the end of his run. The field was spread out all around and everybody was ready and waiting while the second hand rolled around for one more lost minute. At last, at twenty-past, Kettleborough said what everybody had been waiting to hear since he and his colleague, Michael Gough, led everyone off on Sunday morning. “Gents, let’s play.” So the players set about the last rites of this dismal game.It has been a long and frustrating five days at the Ageas Bowl. At Old Trafford the previous week we saw the best of Test cricket, here we got the worst of it, five perfectly absurd days, little snippets of cricket in between rain delays and breaks in play caused by bad light, hours spent watching groundstaff run the covers on and off and umpires humming and hawing about the damp patches of the outfield. The game is always a hostage to conditions, but it is fair to say there has been some debatable decision-making about when and whether they were fit for play in the past few days.Maybe the umpires were a little too finickity the first time they stopped play for bad light. The reading they took then was the benchmark for the rest of the game, which meant they were not able to play for long stretches of Friday and Sunday. They could have waited longer before abandoning play on Sunday, given that the sun came out late in the day. Perhaps the groundstaff were maybe a little backwards mopping up, too, but then, they have had a long few weeks and the listlessness that settles over a game like this becomes infectious.This kind of carry-on is always irritating, but it is especially so this summer, when the ECB, PCB, Cricket West Indies and all the players and support staff have gone to such lengths to get these series on. But it is worth remembering, too, the umpires are part of that staff and must be as tired, and stressed, as everyone else. Besides, add it all up and you come to maybe 30 or so lost overs. The backlash against them has been a little bit over the top because there have been a lot of fed-up people around the ground with nothing else to talk about.After all, there have been two drawn Test matches in England in the past five years. It feels a little stiff to start nailing people because there has been a third. It may be the reason the game still has an issue with bad light is because it is not so very pressing a problem the administrators have felt absolutely compelled to find a way to fix it. Because they have certainly spent a lot of time talking about it before, in worse circumstances than this.Remember the Ashes Test at the Oval in 2013? It was the last time there was so much heat about so little light. The fourth day of that game was washed out and on the fifth Australia declared to set England 227 to win. They needed 21 from the last 24 balls when the umpires decided it was too dark to play. There was a full house and the game was on the line. It was all a lot more frustrating than the situation we have just seen. In the aftermath of that match, the ECB called for the ICC to change the light regulations.It happened to England again in Dubai three years later, when they were 25 runs short against Pakistan. Dave Richardson explained then the board still had “not really found a solution”. The problem was not the administrators. “We have attempted in the past to say to the players, if you have floodlights and they’re good enough to use for Test cricket, we should just bite the bullet, and even if conditions are not as good as they might be normally, we should just play on.” he said. “However, that approach wasn’t accepted by any of the teams. They felt that would be unfair and would lead to unjust finishes.”You still sense the players are not willing to make major changes. Joe Root scotched the idea of using a pink ball, like they do in day-night games. He suggested starting earlier the next day, but that would punish the spectators who have paid for tickets. Either way, someone has something to get angry about. Truth is, it is an easier problem to shout about than it is to solve. You may as well be mad at the clouds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dd563f6082c200c692a673f3b0aeb1c435e4ca3/183_118_4706_2824/master/4706.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=917cd32c6399249ab96e2d257b9d6165","title":"ronnie o sullivan darkness doubt snooker perfection compelling","story":"Six-times world champion is happier than he has ever been and perhaps the least we owe him is to accept him on his own termsPerhaps it was fitting that it should end on a miscue. Maybe this is just the imagination playing trick shots but for a snooker player widely acclaimed as the greatest of all time, Ronnie O’Sullivan does seem to miscue quite a lot? Certainly more than you’d expect from your average preternatural, life-affirming, once-in-a-generation talent.There was one against Mark Williams at the 2016 Masters that cost him the frame. One against Ali Carter at the Crucible in 2018 that cost him the match. In fact, there are compilations on YouTube: the horrible scrape of the cue, the ball skewing through the air, the horrified gasps of shock from the crowd.And so it was again, against Kyren Wilson on Sunday night: a poor one-sided final about to be crowned with a glorious century break, if only O’Sullivan could pot a tricky last black. “Clunk.” An audience groan. For O’Sullivan, simply a scowl of grim, placid acceptance. As if this had been coming all along. As if he knew it would end like this. “If I must die, I will encounter darkness as a bride, and hug it in mine arms! Now, to collect my sixth world championship and a cheque for £500,000.”Maybe you found this quite a dissonant ending. To me, it was perfect. It was pure Ronnie: beauty tarnished by ugliness, ugliness uplifted by triumph, triumph pursued by fatalism and inevitable talk of retirement. This is why the frequent comparisons with Lionel Messi or Roger Federer, with Picasso or Mozart, have never quite seemed to capture the essence of him. Or why, if he is indeed such an unimpeachable talent, it has taken him seven years to regain the world title.It’s not just about the beauty, or the perfection. It’s not just those irresistible passages of play when he makes the game look so easy he may as well have downloaded it. It’s also the darkness and the doubt, the wandering thoughts, the duelling contradictions, the quiet madness bubbling beneath the surface, the sheer fragility of what you’re seeing. Or, put more simply: you can’t truly appreciate an O’Sullivan break without simultaneously confronting the possibility that at any moment, and for no reason at all, he might miss.Often you will find these contradictions rather glibly expressed as O’Sullivan’s “demons”, a term that only really serves to underline the inadequacy of sport’s mental health vocabulary. As O’Sullivan explains so well in his book Running, the relationship between his profession and his state of mind is frequently far less operatic and far more complex.Sometimes it manifests itself in an overactive imagination, other times in a lapse of concentration. Sometimes it leads him into addiction, other times into ennui, other times – as when he disdainfully tried to smash his way out of a snooker against Mark Selby in the semi-final – into a sort of wilful self-sabotage.“Am I prepared to give blood, sweat and tears?” he said in an interview before the tournament. “No. Would everybody else like to see me give blood, sweat and tears? Probably yes.”For us as onlookers, there is a faintly problematic ring to all this. After all, the greatest part of sport is the part you don’t understand, and O’Sullivan’s thrilling inconsistency and caprice are part of what makes him so compelling to watch. But to what extent is it legitimate to enjoy the spectacle of someone teetering on the precipice? To what extent does O’Sullivan owe us his talent? To what extent is he required to keep practising for hours in dimly lit rooms for our entertainment?There isn’t a right or a wrong answer to this, by the way: it’s simply an acknowledgement that with certain athletes – Nick Kyrgios and Tyson Fury also spring to mind – what is in their best interests and what is in ours are not always in perfect alignment.This is a problem for snooker too, which has long been bracing itself for the day when O’Sullivan finally takes his leave. In a way, snooker has been a victim of its own inexorable rise in standards. A sport in which any of the top 16 can now punish the slightest safety error is one that will inevitably tend to reward the steady percentage players: your Selbys, your Wilsons, your Anthony McGills. Even Judd Trump has to become a wiser, less interesting player to reach the game’s summit.The truth is that in order to thrive as a flawed maverick in the modern game, you need to be at least as talented as O’Sullivan. And as O’Sullivan so tartly pointed out earlier in the tournament, there are few signs that anyone else currently comes close.In the meantime, we still have Ronnie. And for all the usual wild extrapolations – now for Hendry’s record! Sports Personality of the Year! a knighthood! – perhaps the least we owe a man who has provided us with so much pleasure over the years is to accept him on his own terms. He is 44 now, and by all accounts as happy as he’s ever been, with a erse range of interests and a healthier outlook on life.“Everything in moderation” is one of his mottos, from food to exercise to rest to snooker and in that simple phrase lies the secret of his unlikely contentment. Perhaps on reflection, O’Sullivan’s greatest triumph was to conquer the ledger of his own happiness. Perhaps the toughest opponent he ever had to crack was himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86554d6cf8a2c2f8805c39a6900d87f14963af50/0_65_2360_1415/master/2360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41562470af4797bf794717536e0d720e","title":"dylan hartley england tales rugby union no place to hide","story":"Former England captain’s enlightening autobiography could loosen a few tongues among his less forthright successorsIt was always likely that Dylan Hartley’s soon-to-be published autobiography would cause a ripple or two. Few rugby players have managed to ide opinion so reliably or reinvent themselves so successfully dull anonymity has rarely been the former England captain’s speciality. The initial passages to emerge from his book, The Hurt, are both forthright and striking.Perhaps most significant of all, however, is the harsh light Hartley shines on rugby itself. Not since Jonny Wilkinson’s slightly disturbing autobiography has a high-profile England player made his day job sound more wince-inducing. “My generation of players have been crash dummies for a sport in transition from semi-professionalism,” he writes, suggesting the game’s money men treat those who take the field like “human widgets” and revealing that he discouraged his family from visiting the team hotel on days off “because it would have felt like a prison visit”.There are mountaineering books on conquering Everest that paint a softer picture than Hartley’s description of the England camp under the relentless Eddie Jones. Nothing truly worth achieving is ever easy, clearly, but the Rugby Football Union cannot be entirely sanguine when a hard-nosed senior player says there were times “when playing for England felt a bit like taking part in one of those brutal dance marathons in the Great Depression of the 1920s, where penniless couples kept going until they collapsed”.Touching the void, and all that. As with his lineout throwing in the latter half of his career, the former Northampton and England hooker has taken aim at some tricky targets and hit a good number of them. It will be interesting to see if Jones’s employer is brave enough to demand any adjustments for the sake of those who remain. Even rugby’s hardest nuts have soft centres, mentally if not physically.Hartley, to be absolutely clear, rates Jones as the best coach he played under. But can a sport whose smashed-up participants struggle to wipe their own backsides the day after games and gobble painkillers like Smarties – Hartley’s words – be considered entirely healthy? Every leading sportsperson requires crazy levels of commitment these days the term player welfare increasingly feels like an oxymoron for all those at rugby’s coal face.On the face of it, Hartley is one of the lucky ones: he led England for a lengthy period, reaped the financial benefits that came with it and has a young family he adores. There are umpteen players out there who would settle for a fraction of that return. But just because Hartley was personally able to absorb such fearsome levels of punishment, it should not obscure the wider price today’s top players risk having to pay. If any line in Hartley’s book chills the blood it is the 34-year-old’s admission that, following multiple concussions, he gets dizzy easily and sometimes gets his words muddled.No wonder his wife, Jo, says she is relieved he has now retired. Where once there would have been little doubt as to whether boxing or rugby union was the more punishing pro sport, now it feels a much-closer-run thing. The difference is that top boxers are paid millions rugby players are seeing their wages drop at a time when their trade has never felt more consistently brutal.It is another reason why Hartley’s views on how players might be better protected in future should carry hefty weight. He advocates central contracts, a six-month season and fewer league games, with bone-on-bone contact training restricted to pre-season alone. This, remember, is someone who played 96 Tests in the front row and served 60 weeks in suspensions. Even the toughest, most grizzled of hombres are saying enough is enough.There is an argument that, for maximum effect, Hartley should have expressed a few more of these pithy opinions while he was still wearing the England captain’s armband. Not easy, clearly, and potentially career-shortening, but The Hurt underlines what many of us who sit through endlessly-beige press conferences with muzzled, overly media-managed players have been saying for years. If they told it like it is more often, players might find a few more influential people will have no choice but to listen.Congratulations to Dylan, either way, for speaking out now. It would not surprise me if a fair amount of the love he occasionally forfeited during his career comes flooding back when people realise he is smarter and funnier in real life than they had appreciated. Yes, Hartley’s tale is a cautionary one in some respects but his testimony might just prove to be the catalyst that frees others up to make a positive difference. Here’s hoping it allows the next generation of international forwards to wipe their own backsides unaided in future.It is a while since England were so spoilt for choice at fly-half. It is way too soon, clearly, to pension off Owen Farrell or George Ford – aged 28 and 27 respectively – but Exeter’s Joe Simmonds, Harlequins’ Marcus Smith and Wasps’ Jacob Umaga are all knocking enthusiastically on Eddie Jones’s door. The trio all have something about them and would interest any of the home nations if you were placing a bet on which of them will go on to win the most Test caps you might be tempted to say Smith, a long-time Jones favourite, but it is no coincidence that Simmonds and Umaga are playing for teams in the Premiership top four. All three are good enough to be around for a while.The suspended Guinness Pro 14 season is due to restart this weekend, albeit minus the cross-border element of the league, with the semi-finals and final scheduled to follow next month. The provincial ‘derbies’ will be useful for national coaches as they seek to finalise their autumn plans but will also be monitored closely by European Professional Club Rugby officials, still desperate for their own tournament to resume in mid-September. Amid all the excitement surrounding the return of live rugby in Britain and Ireland, a potential sudden spike in Covid-19 infections in the next fortnight would be an absolute nightmare for the authorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42dfc4071d04d00004ab0388c73d4a93ad0f2388/556_267_4880_2931/master/4880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f09dfdd14d378902bc499b29a559e76","title":"county cricket surrey v hampshire yorkshire v derbyshire and more live","story":"Soggy at Headingley.Nice at Grace Road, Northampton, Edgbaston, Arundel, Hove.Not sure at Trent Bridge, Canterbury and Sophia Gardens.An interesting read on the Netflix documentary on the women’s T20 World Cup:It comes out in the same week that the Rajasthan Royals announced a new sponsor, Niine, an Indian firm that makes sanitary towels.

She’s starring in Martin Sherman’s Rose, which will be available for three nights only – to replicate the sense of theatrical occasion – but online, rather than live. “It’s a story of one woman’s recollection, from the Holocaust to the six-day war, and slightly beyond, and how she comes to make a stand herself, rather than just survive. The play begins and ends with her making a statement about humanity, rather than just on being Jewish or a gentile.”She’s thrilled about the role – originally made famous by Olympia Dukakis – and makes the point that, by the time you hit 74, parts don’t just end up in your lap. She’s also in Coronation Street, of course, and describes fitting the two filming schedules in with the unsociable hours and the midnight taxis of the actor in high demand. She’s so positive about Sherman’s work, however – “it’s as sensitive, clever, deep and profound a piece as I’ve read” – that you can sense a “but …” coming, and there is one. “I’d done Martin’s other play, Messiah” – this was 1982 – “and I had an unfortunate experience: somebody in Hampstead stood up and screamed at me. It rattled me. I’ve always been a very confident actress and I never really questioned my confidence on stage, but it did unsettle me as a person. And then, of course, the BT adverts happened around the same time, and it suddenly turned me from a jobbing actress to a Jewish actress.”That ad had a mysteriously huge impact. Lipman was Beattie, the witty, caustic Jewish grandmother (at one point her son, for reasons I can neither recall nor guess at, refers to her breasts, and she says: “Huh, they moved south about the same time you did”). It was so talked-about that it did rather eclipse her earlier reputation: as a stage talent, a member of both the National Theatre Company and the RSC, Lamda-trained, having grown up in Hull with a tailor father and a fiercely encouraging mother. She was a sitcom favourite in the 70s, early in the genre, and always memorable even in small roles, such as Sylvie in Up the Junction.Lipman isn’t complaining about being typecast – she’s sprightly and pragmatic on that: “You’re bloody glad to have a good part. Because I’m not going to be in Downton Abbey, am I?” It’s a much more complicated point she’s making, which starts with pigeonholes. “In the last few years, we’re all in little boxes, aren’t we? You have to play what you are. The whole purpose of acting is to play what you’re not.” This lands us, arse over tit, if you’ll forgive the phrase (this whole conversation has brought the 80s rushing back), in the trans debate. “They’re saying, now, nobody can play a person who’s trans unless they are. I’m thinking of Scarlett Johansson, she turned down a trans role because she said it wasn’t fair to take it. And that’s a good choice.“But we’re in a different timeline, because anybody can play Shylock, and they do. Anybody can play a survivor, and they do.” For all that Lipman is famously outspoken, I can’t work out what she really thinks. Should anybody be allowed to play Shylock? Did Scarlett Johansson make a good choice? “I am all for people fighting for their rights. Of course. But if somebody’s playing a Holocaust survivor, and I’m looking at them on the television and know that they’re not and never have been Jewish, have I got the same right to say, ‘They shouldn’t play that because they’re not?’”To return to the role of Rose, and Lipman’s audience encounter in Messiah, I wonder whether there isn’t another element to her trepidation about taking on another Sherman play – whether creatively delving into a collective trauma is actually quite traumatic to do. “The early Sherman play was 17th century, so that was a different trauma, they were fleeing a pogrom. But yes, collective trauma is something I’m very aware of. I’m very aware, particularly in my business, of the attitude towards the only Jewish state in the world.”What a segue: Maureen Lipman is famous for her defence of Israel. She actually reprised Beattie for a video attacking Jeremy Corbyn at the last election, but her falling out with the Labour party went back to the leader before – she was furious with Ed Miliband for supporting a House of Commons motion to recognise Palestine as a state.While she remains absolutely caustic about a lot of Labour and its works, she admits quite wryly what her relationship was to this party she has so often renounced. “I was a Labour luvvie, with Blair. I wasn’t really a party member.” She talks about all Blair had to deal with, from foot and mouth disease to the death of Princess Diana, to that other thing to do with cows (mad cow disease, we both realise at once), “and he did it with grace, and style, and he did it with gravitas and statesmanship. You had exactly the same situation with him and Campbell as you did with Boris and Cummings. People in power need advisers.”Does this mean she supports Boris Johnson? It seems like quite a journey from a Labour-ish luvvie to that, and she is laughingly affronted. “I’d have to be stark raving mad to be a supporter of Boris Johnson. And I’m not. I don’t envy him what he wished for, because he got it.”Yet in any conversation about politics, she remains principally vigilant about Israel even when it’s miles from the topic, we somehow end up back there. So we jump from Johnson and what a mess he makes, back to the Labour party and whether or not antisemitism has gone away (“you can see it hasn’t”) and suddenly we’re at the explosion in Beirut, which had happened that day. “As soon as Lebanon happened, I can imagine the types that were ready to say, ‘Israel’s on the border, did they, would they, could they?’ I’m very grateful that Hezbollah said they did it.”Wait, what? It was an accident resulting from political fecklessness, Hezbollah isn’t even the largest party in the Lebanese parliament, and definitely nobody said they did it. She makes a noise as though we’ll just agree to differ.Lipman’s hardline stance on Israel, she suggests, means that she won’t work with certain actors who support the Palestinian cause. “I won’t be going on tour with The Killing of Sister George with Maxine Peake and Miriam Margolyes, put it that way.”Peake, sure, would be an impossible acquaintance, after her recent comments – which she retracted – were deemed anti-Israel enough to get  Rebecca Long-Bailey kicked off the Labour front bench for retweeting her. But Margolyes, surely, is different. Yes, she vocally supports Palestine, but they’re two character actresses of the same generation (Margolyes is five years older) – they must have gone up for the same parts, been to the same parties for decades there must be times when they meet and don’t talk about Israel?“We’ve seen each other at the odd funeral,” she concedes. “I don’t wish her ill. And she’s a very successful leftwing socialist with several houses. Take my point. Need I say more.” Well, not unless you want to … “Most of the stuff that I say is not that dissimilar to her. We’re opinionated women, we’ve got a platform, we tend to spew out the first thing that comes into our fevered little brains. It’s just that, unfortunately, I’m right.”Give or take a quick drive-by attack on John McDonnell and Diane Abbott, this has a mellowing effect on the conversation, and she reverts to the views of the Blair-era luvvie – worried about the future of theatre (“if the rats are eating the velvet, I’m going to be really sad”), mindful of the other side of the coin (“I do think the West End had become moribund. Shows were running for too long and they were tired”), relaxed and self-aware: “A lot of us, it’s very hard to distinguish between wanting a job and wanting to show off. I don’t know the difference, I never have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a49365584816a0302ff80beecc57b200b126cc59/204_195_4854_2913/master/4854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cce5c7eb204ab37c56429aef5fc9ebc5","title":"overall its like the most chaotic pinterest board made real birch hertfordshire review","story":"Birch is the latest ‘concept’ hotel to chase the Instagram generation, but haphazard design and pricey wellness and creative activities leave little room for relaxation Arriving at Birch, you would be forgiven for thinking you were headed to a service station. Close enough to the M25 that the constant thrum of cars provides a blanket backdrop of noise, the presence of an imposing Georgian mansion at the end of a dirt track turn-off comes as a surprise. There are no fruit machines or KFC here.A longstanding hotel and conference centre near Cheshunt, the imposing 22-hectare, Grade II listed property has been the subject of a radical makeover by Chris Penn, former managing director of US brand Ace Hotels. The Birch ethos, Penn told me, is to “give a shit”, to be “accessible,” to be “a festival at a hotel” or, perhaps, not even be a hotel at all. Rather, a space for “escape artists” – those wishing to get away from the relentless pace of London, located only a 30-minute train ride north from the capital.What do these awkward aphorisms mean outside of investor pitch meetings? At first glance, it means an effective marketing strategy – one that has seen Birch fully booked for every weekend in August and filled with 4x4-driving families, Lululemon-legged groups of friends and young couples theatrically photographing each other in the hotel’s many spaces. These spaces include an impressive Wellness Centre, refurbished from a previous incarnation as a Tesco training building, a music room replete with karaoke machine, two bars, two restaurants, a bakery and an open-plan social space called The Hub, complete with off-shooting rooms for co-working.There is a lot to take in at Birch. To begin with, the design is haphazard and overwhelming. Walk through the property and vast, newly painted ultramarine walls give way to exposed plasterwork before labyrinthine corridors lead to Matisse-style murals, beautiful original mosaic flooring, Ercol-style furniture and more exposed pipework and air ducts than you’d see at your nearest Costco. In the 140 rooms (doubles, twins and family rooms with additional bunks) there are no desks and no TVs, just inordinately comfortable beds, obscure sculptural hanging racks, bunches of dried flowers and – in my case – a dingy bathroom repainted bubblegum pink. There are well-thought-out moments, such as the inidual ceramic keyrings that match the room numberings, or the handcrafted beer and wine taps, but overall it is like the most chaotic Pinterest board made real a hasty DIY SOS makeover meets industrial-chic Hackney cafe.And it is not just the design that perplexes. A core function of Birch is to offer a curated “cultural programme”. This means that during your stay you can take part in classes ranging from gong baths to sourdough and soda breadmaking, glassblowing workshops and outdoor yoga (hand sanitiser and posters asking people to keep distanced are dotted about). These classes come at a cost, ranging from £20 for an hour of soda-bread kneading to £150 for a pair to go glassblowing, and there is so much on offer, each experience inevitably feels underwhelming. For instance, my gong bath was interrupted by the sounds of cars wheeling through crunching gravel outside, a snoring attendee and the unceremonious checking of payments at the beginning. After an hour, I left feeling as unrelaxed as ever.Birch sits among the trend hotels aiming to cater to young people more likely to choose an Airbnb for a hyperlocal, informal stay rather than the commercial rigidity of an establishment. It is a concept that has gained traction in recent years, prompting multinationals such as Hilton and Accor to launch new, less staid brands, as well as spawning new contenders in the likes of Curtain, a hotel and members’ club in Shoreditch, and apart-hotel groups like Locke Living, with their focus on co-working spaces, wellness programmes and “creative” events. Birch muddies this easygoing ethos by also being a members’ club. Anyone can become a member for £100 a month, as well as £150 joining fee, and that allows unfettered access to classes and discount room rates, which start at £120 per night for a double room.Penn may want the Birch ethos to be one of accessibility and inclusivity, with guests feeling empowered to try new experiences at will, but money is of course everything. And everything at Birch falls into the “London prices” category: £4 for a small bottle of lemonade, £10 for a mini ingot of goat’s cheese and crackers, £10 for a sandwich. The water, though, is free.There is one place where Birch makes sense. That is at chef Robin Gill’s Zebra Riding Club restaurant. In the manor’s old stables, an open-plan kitchen produces remarkably good food at £48 for its tasting menu. The ethos is farm-to-table and dishes include home-cured bresaola with pickled green tomato and perfect sourdough from the onsite bakery, firm yet flaky monkfish steaks, and a mouth-wateringly umami broth with eggs from rescued battery Birch hens. Perhaps this restaurant should be made more central to the Birch experience, rather than another adjunct to try out.Birch is at pains to tell you it is not just a hotel – it is a wellness space, an oasis of respite from London located close enough to London and filled with enough people from London to make you feel like you’re still in London, while savouring the opportunity to tell your Instagram followers that you are, actually, not in London. It is chasing the lustre of a concept brand for cashed-up millennials, yet with this generation facing down a second “once in a lifetime” recession, their needs would be better served with a space that can offer affordable, quiet respite, rather than a brand pressuring its guests to constantly “do”.If Birch put its keen hyperactivity to rest and focused on what it could do well – food and board – then it might reach that hallmark of holistic wellness: considered simplicity. Until then, it is merely another playground for the moderately wealthy, clothed in the marketing babble of inidual absolution.• Accommodation was provided by Birch, which has doubles from £120 room-only (breakfast from £5), birchcommunity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10237fd738883146a33e4abef49af21af8490c3b/0_167_4260_2556/master/4260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50add8098de2086e80949fadc8c06b5f","title":"ellen degeneres ellen show three producers leave","story":"Departures come amid backstage turmoil and complaints of bullying, racism and sexual misconduct against three producersThree top producers on the The Ellen DeGeneres Show have exited the popular television talkshow, Warner Bros said on Monday, after an internal investigation into complaints of bullying, racism and sexual misconduct against them.A spokesperson for Warner Bros, which produces the show, on Monday said that three senior producers had “parted ways” with the show.The departures followed weeks of turmoil backstage that has undermined the show’s public message of spreading kindness and happiness.Reports of a hostile workplace have included criticism that DeGeneres is mean-spirited.

While the epic new sci-fi-fantasy-horror-drama bears his name and invokes his trademark eldritch monstrosities, I suspect that Lovecraft himself wouldn’t have made it past the opening titles. Not because Lovecraft Country isn’t good television – it’s great television – but because, as well as being a hugely influential pulp fiction author, Lovecraft was a notorious racist. Lovecraft Country, meanwhile, is a beautiful bounty of black creativity and black history. It is protest art, just when the world needs it most.In the US in the mid-50s, Korean war veteran Atticus “Tic” Freeman (Jonathan Majors of Da 5 Bloods and The Last Black Man in San Francisco) is travelling north from Florida to his family’s home on the South Side of Chicago. Asleep on the bus, he has garish dreams of shooting at flying saucers and slime-dripping aliens, but waking life in the Jim Crow era is hardly less nightmarish, whichever side of the Mason-Dixon Line you find yourself on.Tic is on the trail of his missing father, Montrose (Michael K Williams), who was last heard from in the area of Massachusetts known as Lovecraft Country because of its association with the author. So, after regrouping in his old neighbourhood, that’s the direction Tic sets off in, accompanied by his Uncle George (Courtney B Vance), a fellow pulp fiction fan and author of Green Book-style safety guides for black travellers and Letitia (Jurnee Smollett), a childhood friend with a rebellious streak.It’s when the trio set out on the road – through the rural midwest heartlands, en route to the nation’s historical colonial settlements – that this show’s phenomenal world-building really comes into its own. The visual effects and monster scares are as high spec as you would expect from a show which boasts The Force Awakens’ JJ Abrams as an executive producer. But it’s in the seemingly innocuous period details, and the influence of another executive producer, Get Out’s Jordan Peele, that the true horror lurks. When, for instance, they pull out of a gas station to avoid the racist mockery of a teenager, a billboard using “mammy” imagery to advertise Aunt Jemima’s Pancakes is revealed it’s insidious and inescapable.Then there’s Lydia’s, a diner that George is considering for inclusion in his guide, after receiving a tip about it. It’s supposed to be welcoming to black clientele, but something seems off when they walk in – maybe it’s under new management? and it’s not until Tic notices the freshly painted walls that the situation becomes clear. “Uncle George, remind me why the White House is white?” he says. “They had to paint it white to cover up the burn marks,” George tells him, just as Letitia comes screaming out of the bathroom and a mob of locals armed with shotguns comes careening round the corner. This sets up Lovecraft Country’s priorities nicely: expect thrilling action-adventure as the first order of business, but there is historical insight here, too, if you pay attention.It’s also got heart. Like Buffy the Vampire Slayer before it, Lovecraft Country is fantastical horror, grounded in emotionally intelligent family drama. Letitia has a difficult relationship with her older sister Ruby (Wunmi Mosaku), and, for reasons as yet unexplained, didn’t make it home for their mother’s funeral. Tic can’t forgive his alcoholic father for the physical abuse he suffered as a child, even though, as Uncle George points out, Montrose had a difficult childhood, too. Their traumas were first inflicted many years, if not many generations, back but the wound is still red-raw. Or, as Montrose put it in his cryptic letter to his son: “You think that you can forget the past you can’t. The past is a living thing, you own it, owe it.”For all of TV’s worthy engagements with Black Lives Matter – the Fox miniseries Shots Fired, episodes of The Good Wife and Scandal – this show, which isn’t even addressing the movement directly, seems to speak to it most meaningfully. It’s no coincidence that Lovecraft Country is also the most entertaining series to grace our screens for months. Showrunner Misha Green knows how to find the joy in the moment – or in the pages of a good pulp novel – without denying the historical context. Perhaps even a blinkered bigot like Lovecraft would have come to admire that eventually."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da648ba3fab2ed592a05909d4eb46f8d4b76c867/0_77_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2bcc7c13129609d56b205a5a2406eb2","title":"tv tonight the winners and losers of manchesters property boom","story":"A documentary looks at who is affected by the city’s rapid development.

In January, less than a month after the Bagram attack, the US killed the Iranian Revolutionary Guard general Qassem Suleimani, in a drone strike in Baghdad, but that attack is not thought to have been a direct retaliation for Bagram.“The Department of Defense does not disclose timelines or discussions surrounding internal deliberations and intelligence briefings. With that being said, the department has repeatedly demanded, both publicly and privately, that Iran cease its scourge of malign and destabilizing behavior throughout the Middle East and the world,” a Pentagon spokesman, Maj Rob Lodewick, said.“While the United States, its Nato allies and coalition partners are working to facilitate an end to 19 years of bloodshed, Iran’s inimical influence seeks to undermine the Afghan peace process and foster a continuation of violence and instability.”The report comes nearly two months after allegations that Russia was paying bounties to Taliban fighters for killing Americans in Afghanistan. Donald Trump rejected those reports as a “hoax”, but the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, confirmed he warned his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, that there would be “an enormous price to pay” if Moscow was paying such bounties. The Pentagon has said it will investigate the reports of Russian bounties but has so far not produced a conclusion to that investigation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2555792d63ee852b6bd9e655317d1f57f56e4f4/0_0_5626_3378/master/5626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2686575bb686dbab23e97dacab0b1a6f","title":"louis dejoy usps postmaster general election","story":"Since taking office in June, DeJoy has executed sweeping changes at the struggling USPS, leading to delays in mail delivery – and fears mail-in ballots won’t arrive on timeAbout a month ago, a United States Postal Service (USPS) mail carrier named Mark arrived at his post office in central Pennsylvania and got some shocking news from his station manager. Mark and his coworkers were told they would have to depart the office for deliveries a few hours earlier each day, even if that meant leaving behind much of the day’s mail.In the weeks that followed, higher-ups at the station instructed carriers to abandon hundreds of pieces of mail in order to depart a mere 10 or 20 minutes earlier. As the days went on, the excess mail started to pile up, and now Mark estimates there are thousands of undelivered letters and packages sitting in his station.“The supervisors are cracking the whip, making sure we leave,” Mark told the . “Meanwhile carriers are walking by and saying, ‘Look at all this fucking mail we’re walking past, it’s just sitting there.’”When Mark and his coworkers confronted the station manager he said he was only following orders from the new USPS postmaster general, Louis DeJoy. Since taking office in June, DeJoy has executed sweeping changes at the struggling US Postal Service, shaking up agency leadership and rolling out policies that have led to delays in mail delivery. These changes, which DeJoy has said are designed to cut down on labor costs, have angered advocates and Democratic politicians, who have accused him of trying to tamper with the election just weeks before millions of Americans start casting their ballots through the mail.Now, the controversial logistics executive and Trump mega-donor arguably has more power than any other official in the country to affect the outcome of this year’s presidential election.Donald Trump has maintained a public obsession with the USPS, which he has called “a joke”. In particular he has fulminated against the agency’s business relationship with Amazon: despite studies showing that the USPS makes a profit by shipping packages for the e-commerce giant, Trump has repeatedly insisted that the agency should charge Amazon higher rates.To stanch the bleeding, congressional Democrats have proposed giving the agency up to $25bn in aid money as part of their second coronavirus relief package, but Trump on Thursday again came out against that proposal on the grounds that it would help the USPS handle mail-in ballots, which he wrongfully believes would lead to voter fraud.Without an aid package, the USPS has faced unprecedented challenges with staffing and scheduling due to the impact of the coronavirus on its already stretched thin workforce. Customers in more than a dozen states have reported delays of days or even weeks in mail delivery, including for essentials like prescription medicine. And a number of recent primary elections have been marred by postal failures: numerous voters in Wisconsin and Michigan never received absentee ballots they requested weeks in advance, while New York postal workers inadvertently disqualified thousands of ballot envelopes for not having proper postmarks.Amid this turmoil, DeJoy’s appointment represents the culmination of a years-long attempt by the Trump administration to gain control over the USPS: earlier this year the president also filled two vacancies on the agency’s board of governors with agency outsiders, giving him complete control over the regulatory body.DeJoy is only the fifth postmaster general in history to come from the private sector. He has never worked for the USPS, but he benefited as CEO of New Breed Logistics from a long business relationship with the agency. In the late 1980s the shipping company signed an equipment contract with the USPS and over the next 20 years the agency became one of the company’s biggest customers alongside private companies such as Sony and Estee Lauder. A North Carolina newspaper later referred to the USPS contract as the New Breed’s “big break”.But DeJoy’s tenure at New Breed was marked by controversy: the National Labor Relations Board ruled that the company’s interactions with its workers were “motivated by anti-union animus”, and the company paid out more than $1.7m in fines for labor law violations between 2001 and 2015, according to the Intercept. In early 2000, DeJoy’s younger brother, Dominick, sued Louis and a third brother, Michael, accusing them of defrauding him out of a one-third stake in the company, according to a news article at the time.As he grew his logistics empire, DeJoy also made a name for himself as a prolific Republican fundraiser, hosting lavish dinners out of his home in Greensboro, a $5m mansion compound. Former president George W Bush held a $1,000-a-plate event at the home in 2006 ahead of that year’s midterm elections, while former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin held another closed-door event at the home two years later.DeJoy, meanwhile, is not the only member of his family to enter politics: his wife, Aldona Wos, served as ambassador to Estonia under Bush and later headed the North Carolina department of health and human services, where she faced criticism for hiring a number of Republican campaign aides and former New Breed employees. In 2014, the USDA discovered a pattern of shoddy bookkeeping and an enormous backlog in the state’s database of food stamp recipients in her agency. This year, Trump nominated Wos to serve as the US ambassador to Canada.It took about 30 years, but leading New Breed eventually paid off. In 2014, he sold the company to logistics conglomerate XPO for a reported $615m, and became CEO of XPO. When DeJoy retired in 2015, he told local newspapers he was spending some time at his beach house, eating meals with his two children, and “actually reading” his Wall Street Journal. He also launched a holding company, LDJ Strategies, that he planned to use to deploy his money in real estate and private equity investments.According to financial disclosures obtained by CNN, DeJoy still maintains a large stake in XPO Logistics, and owns large amounts of Amazon stock, creating two glaring conflicts of interest for a man leading a government agency that competes with both companies in some areas. Outside ethics experts called the disclosures “shocking”.But DeJoy’s principal activity during his short retirement turned out to be kicking up fundraising efforts for the GOP, especially Donald Trump. Beginning around 2016, DeJoy donated more than $1.2m to pro-Trump Pacss, making him one of the president’s largest single donors. He hosted a $15,000-a-seat fundraiser for Trump at his home in late 2017, noting in the invitation that while “the president and his team have had some missteps … it is hard to deny the extreme and unreasonable challenges he faces from the political establishment”.Last year the Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, named DeJoy chairman of fundraising for the Republican national convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, and he hosted Mike Pence to kick off his money-raising efforts. In an interview ahead of the event, DeJoy said he planned to raise around $70 million using a strategy of “nationwide begging”.The RNC last month decided to scale down the Charlotte convention due to concerns about the coronavirus, but DeJoy’s ample fundraising for the event paid off, nonetheless, in the form of his appointment to the position of postmaster general.In his short tenure at USPS, DeJoy has already orchestrated risky changes to the agency. In interviews with the , postal workers said DeJoy’s new policies have introduced further confusion to an agency already hampered by the coronavirus pandemic. They worried the inconsistent and sporadic changes could cause serious harm to people and businesses and prevent the agency from ensuring every ballot is counted in the upcoming election.Sasha, a mail carrier in Massachusetts, said USPS leadership has slashed hours for the clerks who sort the mail. This has resulted in a backlog of multiple days for residual mail including heavier packages from Amazon and other delivery services, a delay that has already affected a small-business owner along his route.“This kind of delay of service is voter suppression, plain and simple,” Sasha said. “Not a single person in my station of around 50 employees believes this is anything other than active sabotage, and that includes supporters of the president.”Another carrier in rural North Carolina said his station has started to receive each day’s mail from the sorting plant a few hours earlier than usual. According to the carrier, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, this change almost certainly means that some letters and packages are being left at the plant each day, cutting off some of his most remote customers from supplies or medicine.These issues mirror backlogs that are accumulating around the country: even small post offices are reporting backlogs of up to 10,000 mailpieces, while some postal union officials have also reported that senior leadership are taking away their mail sorting equipment.DeJoy has also enrolled about 400 post offices in a pilot program that prohibits postal clerks from hand-sorting the morning’s mail before letter carriers leave the station to deliver it. Any letters that were not automatically sorted by the station’s machinery are simply left at the station and delivered on some future day, if the carriers get around to it. The union that represents letter carriers has filed a national-level grievance against the program, saying the program unduly restricts carriers’ ability to get the mail out.In response to a request for comment, a USPS spokesperson referred the  to a set of remarks DeJoy released last week in which he said he was “vigorously focusing on the ingrained inefficiencies in our operations” and promised to “aggressively monitor and quickly address service issues”.But for employees like Mark, the postal carrier in Pennsylvania, whose station is taking part in the pilot program, the changes have only led to the massive mail buildup and weeks-long delays. He said he now doubts that the USPS can ensure accuracy in the upcoming election, especially in his home state, which Trump carried by about 40,000 votes in the 2016 election.“If you asked me a month ago can the postal service handle an influx of mail-in ballots, I would have said, ‘We’ve been through two world wars and a depression, we’ve been doing this for more than 200 years,’” he said.“Now, I’m not so sure.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ee83c99d70e6f54a5898fb0e395a3b94b9f95ae/0_8_5472_3286/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3574f0b8d7562abda0552bd790efe3e5","title":"israel and uae open phone link after historic deal","story":"Connection of phone service represents the first concrete sign of the agreement made last week to establish diplomatic ties A telephone service between the United Arab Emirates and Israel has begun working as the two countries opened diplomatic ties, part of a deal brokered by the US that required Israel to suspend its contentious plan to annex the West Bank.UAE foreign minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan called his Israeli counterpart, Gabi Ashkenazi, in what Israel hailed as an important step.Congratulating the UAE on “removing the blocks”, Israeli communications minister Yoaz Handel issued a statement on Sunday saying: “Many economic opportunities will open now, and these trust-building steps are an important step toward advancing states’ interests.”Associated Press journalists in Jerusalem and Dubai were able to call each other from both landline and mobile phones registered to Israel’s country code +972 from around 1.15pm.Also on Sunday, Israeli news websites that had previously been blocked by UAE authorities, such as the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post and YNet, could be accessed without using means to bypass internet filtering in the Emirates.In the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, a recorded message in Arabic and English would typically play prior to Sunday saying calls to +972 numbers could not be connected. The advent of internet calling allowed people to get around the ban, although these too were often interrupted.Some in Israel used Palestinian mobile phones with +970 numbers, which those in the UAE could call.The connection of phone service represents the first concrete sign of the deal between the Emiratis and Israelis.Israel and the UAE announced on Thursday they were establishing full diplomatic relations in the US-brokered accord.The historic deal delivered a foreign policy victory to President Donald Trump as he seeks re-election and reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about arch enemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians.Palestinians say it puts a just resolution of the Middle East conflict even farther out of reach by undermining an Arab consensus that recognition of Israel only come in return for concessions in peace talks. That removes a rare source of leverage for the Palestinians.The agreement will make the UAE the third Arab country, after Egypt and Jordan, to have full, active diplomatic ties with Israel. The UAE and Israel announced it in a joint statement, saying deals between the two countries were expected in the coming weeks in such areas as tourism, direct flights and embassies.Early on Sunday, the Emirates’ state-run WAM news agency announced a UAE company had signed an agreement with an Israeli company for research and study of the coronavirus pandemic.The move has sparked anger among some who see it as a betrayal of longstanding efforts to establish an independent state of Palestinians. In Pakistan, hundreds of Islamists rallied on Sunday to denounce the Emirati-Israeli deal. The Jamaat-e-Islami party chanted slogans against the US and burned effigies of Trump. They also set ablaze American and Israeli flags.The deal also has enraged Iran and Turkey, regional rivals of the UAE.On Sunday, the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces called the UAE’s decision a “disaster”. Mohammad Hossein Bagheri urged Abu Dhabi to “revise” its position.“If an incident happens in the Persian Gulf and violates the national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran, even a tiny bit, and we see it from the UAE, we will not tolerate it,” Bagheri said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65c3f9bbe424eca588a24227d49c0cd2e2e3835c/0_481_7835_4700/master/7835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3d6a05d0d6bd82fd09d0bf5725ff6b1","title":"cuba dollar stores coronavirus","story":"The communist government has been forced to allow citizens to spend US currency at special shops, formalising a split between haves and have-notsOn Paseo del Prado, a boulevard in Havana’s colonial district, dozens of people waited expectantly as the staff raised the shutters to open a tatty but revamped shop.Soon after, Alejandro Domínguez, 23, emerged, brandishing meatballs and a giant tin of chopped tomatoes he had just bought with US currency left as tourist tips at his family’s restaurant. “This is a way to get products you can’t find elsewhere,” he said.The dollar is back in communist Cuba.For the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, Cubans with access to greenbacks are able to buy higher-quality products in exclusive hard currency stores.In the last two years, Cuba has been increasingly boxed in by declining deliveries of cheap oil from its main ally, Venezuela, and hardened sanctions imposed by a Trump administration eyeing the Cuban-American vote in Florida.But the island’s cash crisis was brought to a head by the coronavirus pandemic, which has left Cuba without revenue from tourism for four months.“We’re at a crossroads where there’s practically no other way out,” said Oscar Fernández, professor of economics at the University of Havana. “The state is looking for alternatives so it can keep buying food and medicine.”So on 20 July, the cash-strapped island opened 72 new “dollar stores”, selling everything from cheese to power drills.Cuba last opened dollar stores in 1993 as an emergency stopgap when its economy was tanking during the so-called Special Period. The dollar was taken out of circulation and replaced by the CUC in 2004.The government’s rationale for reopening hard currency stores – to increase supply and to rake in foreign currency – is broadly accepted but the mordant irony of the measure escapes few.Recognising the dollar – possession of which was once a criminal offence – as legal tender is a reluctant nod to the financial power of the United States. But it’s also an implicit admission that the CUC, which is officially pegged at 1:1 with the dollar, is not worth as much as the government claims.The measure draws a line between the haves and the have-nots.On a recent morning, Elio Núñez, 45, a welder who receives dollars from abroad, was queueing outside one of them, hoping to buy soap, coffee, ham or “whatever’s in stock”. Achieving absolute equality, he said, is a chimera. “Some people can afford things, others can’t. It’s like that the world over.”Perhaps with optics in mind, the new supermarkets do not allow customers to pay in cash. Rather, Cubans must deposit greenbacks in a dollar-denominated account and pay by debit card in store.In a stormy speech last month, President Miguel Diáz-Canel said “the enemy” would cast the measure as “economic apartheid”. But dollar stores were necessary, he said, to generate the foreign exchange needed to keep the regular shops Cubans use better supplied.Cuba’s domestic response to Covid-19 has largely been successful, but the fallout has brought longstanding problems with the island’s listless, centrally planned economy to the fore.Agriculture, a perennial achilles heel, has been clobbered: state media recently announced that the country is on track to produce just 160,000 tonnes of rice this year – less than a quarter of what it consumes. Figures like these leave Cuba even more dependent on food imports at a time where there is less cash to make purchases.This dearth of supply brings stark consequences. While there are no queues at bodegas (which guarantee bare-essential food and hygiene products at heavily subsidised prices), queues outside local-currency supermarkets are mammoth.In Regla, one of Havana’s better-supplied municipalities, the state has intensified rationing: people must now take their ID cards to make purchases, and can only buy chicken once a fortnight. Crowds gather before dawn, and by 9am, hundreds are waiting outside the main supermarket. People are sweaty and perturbed. The occasional scrap breaks out.In the east of the island, citizens have set up action groups to stop people cutting in line.Dayana Blázquez, a 35-year-old social worker who was queueing outside a dollar store to buy meat, said that although the effects of US sanctions on the island are “palpable”, decades of economic mismanagement mean the state shares the blame. “Right now things are worse than normal, but we’ve had shortages for years,” she said. “Old and new generations have lived this.”For Blázquez, the inequity of selling some products in dollars runs deep. “It’s not fair for those who work their whole lives and have to depend on others to get by when they retire. It’s not fair for graduates and professionals. It’s not fair for anyone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afc6dc939087b954256df74d52d0337e7e9c72c3/0_175_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=786d11069259bb464327fb01587a0c2c","title":"former world leaders call for action to stop lost covid generation","story":"Figures including Tony Blair and Sir John Major say young people shouldn’t be ‘robbed of their education’A group of former world leaders has called for urgent measures to prevent the global health crisis creating a tragic “Covid generation” denied an education.Among the 275-strong group of senior figures are former UK prime ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Sir John Major, as well as economists, politicians and educationalists from around the world.In a letter addressed to G20 leaders, national governments and global financial institutions, the group call for action to ensure that a generation of young people are not “robbed of their education” due to Covid-19.As countries’ lockdowns come to an end, they warn that as many as 30 million children may never return to school because of the pandemic, according to a Unesco report.They have also raised concerns that the world’s poorest children have been “locked out of learning”, denied internet access and, with the loss of free school meals for pupils across the globe, face the rising threat of hunger. They also state that being in school is the “best defence against forced marriage” for millions of adolescent girls.As part of its proposals, the group suggests that every country should pledge to protect frontline education spending, prioritising the needs of the most disadvantaged children and promoting school participation.It also calls on the international community to increase aid for education, focusing on the most vulnerable, to free up resources for education through debt relief, and for the International Monetary Fund to issue $1.2tn from its global reserve asset towards the countries that need the most support.The letter states: “We write to call for urgent action to address the global education emergency triggered by Covid-19.“With over 1 billion children still out of school because of the lockdown, there is now a real and present danger that the public health crisis will create a Covid generation who lose out on schooling and whose opportunities are permanently damaged.“While the more fortunate have had access to alternatives, the world’s poorest children have been locked out of learning, denied internet access, and with the loss of free school meals – once a lifeline for 300 million boys and girls – hunger has grown.“An immediate concern, as we bring the lockdown to an end, is the fate of an estimated 30 million children who according to Unesco may never return to school.”The letter also highlights the danger of young children being forced into “exploitative and dangerous labour” and progress on gender equity potentially being set back by years.It continues: “We cannot stand by and allow these young people to be robbed of their education and a fair chance in life.” Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland, and Ban Ki-Moon, former UN secretary general, are also among the signatories."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9465f9495986d8447df538f1bec65e3a5da58fb/0_287_4761_2857/master/4761.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0ebd2aac172ce3aaf12631ec1cfa666","title":"loo with a view transparent public toilets installed in tokyo parks","story":"Amenities designed so prospective users can inspect their cleanliness from the outsideIt sounds like the worst kind of anxiety dream – a public toilet cubicle that appears to offer the promise of blessed relief, but which on closer inspection turns out to be entirely see-through.That, though, is the design feature behind several toilets that recently opened in public parks in Tokyo.The “transparent” toilets, created by the Pritzker prize-winning architect Shigeru Ban and more than a dozen other leading designers, are made from coloured “smart glass” that turns opaque when the cubicles are occupied.The conveniences opened this month in five locations in the capital’s Shibuya neighbourhood as part of the Tokyo Toilet Project, organised by the nonprofit Nippon Foundation.Novelty aside, the foundation said there were important practical considerations behind the unusual toilets, which it likened to a “curious piece of playground equipment”.“There are two concerns with public toilets, especially those located in parks,” it said. “The first is whether it is clean inside, and the second is that no one is secretly waiting inside.”Using new technology, the foundation said the cubicles’ glass outer walls turn opaque after the door is locked, allowing prospective users to survey the interior before spending a penny.“At night they light up the parks like a beautiful lantern,” it added.Japan’s hi-tech WCs have long been the subject of fascination among visitors to the country.Toto, the maker of the washlet range, now markets its toilets – complete with washing and drying modes, seat warming and lids that open and close automatically – in China and several other countries.The foundation noted, however, that despite Japanese toilets’ reputation for hygiene, many people still wrongly believed public facilities were “dark, dirty, smelly and scary”.The project plans to install the toilets at 17 locations in Shibuya by next spring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dc6c2c115d691ed3a0b26273dcc468e32acd6c5/27_0_808_485/master/808.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15d3026a083234cf922062606b46ed6c","title":"photo of chinese ambassador to kiribati walking across backs of locals misinterpreted","story":"Image criticised as emblematic of China’s rising influence in Pacific, but i-Kiribati say practice is part of traditional welcoming ceremony A photo reportedly showing the Chinese ambassador to Kiribati walking on peoples’ backs as part of an island welcoming ceremony has ignited debate about outsider interpretation of local custom, as well as geopolitical argument about China’s rising influence across the Pacific.The Chinese ambassador Tang Songgen visited the island of Marakei earlier this month.A photograph taken of his arrival shows the ambassador walking along the backs of young men who had lain on the ground in front of him.The ambassador is holding the hands of two women in traditional dress.While some observers have argued the image is emblematic of China’s increasing influence in the archipelagic nation (the Kiribati government controversially and suddenly switched its diplomatic alliance from Taipei to Beijing last September), many i-Kiribati online have argued the practice is traditional and the photo has been wilfully misinterpreted.The United States’ defence attache to five Pacific Islands including Kiribati, Commander Constantine Panayiotou, said online: “I simply cannot imagine any scenario in which walking on the backs of children is acceptable behavior by an ambassador of any country (or any adult for that matter!) Yet here we are thanks to China’s ambassador to Kiribati.”Australian parliamentarian Dave Sharma, a former diplomat who served in Australia’s mission in Papua New Guinea, said he was surprised by the image.“I’d be very surprised if an Australian representative participated in such a ceremony of this nature,” he told the ABC.The head of Australia’s office for the Pacific said on Tuesday that the current high commissioner, Bruce Cowled, had not participated in any similar ceremony.However, many i-Kiribati pointed out the practice is customary on many islands in the archipelago, and that the formal gesture of welcome had been taken out of context.“This is our island’s show of respect for guests,” Adlih Ztuhcs said online. “If a foreigner marries into a family the men would lie down as a way of welcome. As for the women, the men will carry her on her shoulders to her destination. The same form of welcoming is afforded to all and is seen during weddings and first time visits. Let’s not manipulate facts to suit our stories.”Dr Katerina Teaiwa, associate professor at the Australian National University’s College of Asia and the Pacific, said while symbolism could be potent, the people of Marakei appeared to be showing honour and hospitality, rather than any suggestion of subjugation.“The Marakei people can welcome dignitaries any way they like, it’s well known they follow many of the customs of their land. Everyone should be less hysterical about this and more respectful towards the ersity of Pacific ways, islanders should have cultural self-determination.“Pacific peoples can work out themselves which customs need to be kept or reshaped for our times and which should be changed if violent, discriminatory, etc. I’m always impressed with how i-Kiribati continue to respect the spirits of abara – our lands – in spite of colonial rule.”Tang, appointed China’s ambassador to Kiribati in March, posted a statement online about his visit to Tabiteuea North, Tabiteuea South, and Marakei earlier this month.The statement said “our primary goal is to have China-Kiribati relationship benefit more Kiribati people”.A former British colony made up of three archipelagos sprawled over an ocean area the size of India, Kiribati has acquired significant strategic importance in the era of US-China rivalry in the Pacific.US concerns were enlivened last year after Kiribati’s president Taneti Maamau made a sudden and controversial decision to switch Kiribati’s diplomatic recognition back to China after 17 years allied to Taiwan.The US military has flagged concerns that Kiribati might allow China to build dual-use (military and civilian) facilities on its largest island, Christmas, just 2,000km south of Hawaii, and home of the US Pacific Fleet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed97d0ecbe1c8fb6fa6164ee331fe709ce101e0c/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff6ca421a1980202b471e47a6917ff15","title":"tuesday briefing a level of common sense prevails","story":"‘Sorry for the distress this has caused’ … Michelle Obama says Trump ‘clearly in over his head – it is what it is’ … and shattered lives of Britain’s deporteesGood morning – Warren Murray with news to tide you over for the next little while.The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has sought to blame the exams fiasco on the regulator Ofqual after a humiliating climbdown by the government, which two days earlier said there would be “no U-turn, no change”.

After apparent failures on the contact tracing app, a change of heart on school meals and school opening dates, A-level results becomes the latest issue in the spotlight. Here are of some of its missteps so far:After months of pursuing a £10bn centralised contact-tracing model and hiring more than 18,000 tracers, the government appears to have conceded that a regional approach may be needed to respond to the pandemic. Local authorities had argued for months they had the expertise through their existing public health tracing teams, but it was only in August that the government decided to offer regional teams more support. The changes also mean the axing of 6,000 national call handlers by the end of August.The government was forced to abandon its coronavirus contact-tracing app, which it had been developing for three months and poured millions of pounds into, despite experts repeatedly warning that the app would not work. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, who previously said the app would be ready for nationwide rollout in mid-May after being trialled on the Isle of Wight, explained that the NHS would switch to a decentralised alternative designed by the US tech firms Apple and Google.Boris Johnson announced that the government would be providing food vouchers for some of England’s poorest families after a campaign launched by the footballer Marcus Rashford. It came just 24 hours after No 10 had rejected his plea for it to keep paying for the £15-a-week vouchers over the summer.Prof Neil Ferguson, who was advising the government at the time lockdown was imposed, gave damning testimony that the UK’s Covid-19 death toll could have been halved if the government had introduced the measure a week earlier. Johnson insisted it was premature to make judgments about the government’s approach.The government’s goal was for all primary school children in England to be back in class for a month before the summer holiday. Earlier this month, however,  Williamson admitted that not all children would be able to return before the summer, with some having to wait until September.Johnson announced the government would allow shielding MPs to vote by proxy after an outcry over the treatment of parliamentarians with medical conditions. Those with disabilities said they felt they were being disenfranchised. The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, firmly refused to endorse a proxy voting system and that MPs should instead be paired. Within days of Rees-Mogg’s comments, Johnson announced the change at prime minister’s questions.A scheme granting indefinite leave to remain in the UK to relatives of foreign national NHS staff who die from Covid-19 was extended to low-paid workers after their exclusion attracted widespread criticism. The scheme, introduced in April, initially excluded cleaners, porters and social care workers.In the first major U-turn of his premiership, Johnson announced that overseas NHS staff and care workers would no longer have to pay a controversial visa surcharge. He had rejected calls to scrap it at PMQs the day before.A fortnight after stressing that the evidence was weak on the benefits of face coverings, the government changed its advice to say they should be worn in enclosed spaces and on public transport. It later went further, with a new rule imposed on 15 June that anyone travelling on public transport in England must wear a face covering.The government stopped testing in the community on 12 March and retreated to testing principally in hospitals, according to a damning letter MPs sent to Johnson. The science and technology committee wrote in May that the consequences had been that care home residents and carers could not be tested “at a time when the spread of the virus was at its most rampant”. The government announced plans to rapidly scale up testing at the beginning of April, when  Hancock pledged 100,000 tests a day in England by the end of that month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0958b753c954b9e27597842d13716e3f9bc0782d/0_487_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f7e73ff232da16b050f3f700d1a99fd","title":"this is our future how eight talented young creatives found their voice","story":"Full of ideas and uncompromising about the world they want to live in, eight exceptional iniduals have come together to have their say, their way“It’s tough starting from the bottom and trying to work your way up,” says illustrator Chris Martin. The 22-year-old from Milnthorpe in Cumbria is passionate about illustration, but also wants to stay true to his ideals about the type of work he aims to produce, rooted in skate culture. “The prospect of having my work published nationally felt so distant,” he says. But Chris’s work, along with that of seven other young creatives, will appear next Saturday, 27 June, in a supplement published with .Your Voice. Your Way is being created by young people aged between 18 and 25 from across Britain who feel strongly that they and their contemporaries need to be heard when it comes to shaping the future. “I am driven to uncover how our world is steered,” says Chris. “And how, not just as creatives, but as people, we can change it.” Commissioned by Levi’s and  Labs team, the magazine aims to give a platform to the unheard, and amplify their voices.“Their generation has what I’d call a positive stubbornness,” says Jason Kyriacou, the UK marketing and experience director for Levi’s. “An uncompromising attitude to what they believe in and the courage to act on it.”Now, that attitude is needed more than ever. When  Labs and Levi’s started recruiting for the project, in the first months of 2020, issues surrounding climate change, shifting identities and inclusiveness came up in nearly every application. What gave the project even more urgency was the outbreak of Covid-19.Suddenly the future was ever more uncertain, and the assembled contributors – all with little or no media experience – had to adjust to working on the project remotely and contacting their mentors from  Labs using video meetings.Writer Kiera Moran, 24, has had the unusual experience of self-isolating before, and writes about the experience of seeing her five-year-old son through cancer. She started writing up late at night, caring for her child. “Sleep deprived at 5am, I have spilled my heart out,” says Kiera, from Merthyr Tydfil. “My voice is honest and unassuming. Coming from a working class background, I feel I am familiar and welcoming, with a story hidden behind nightmares. I was excited to have such an amazing opportunity. I hope to develop my writing and use what I’ve learned in future work.”Another writer, Anna Marshall, 21, from Durham, drew on her experience in climate activism for the project. “I want to contribute to a fresher and more daring version of professional journalism,” she says. “I was buzzed to see what we could make together,” she says. “And I was excited to work with talented people who are dedicated to what they do.”For the other two writers, Ayat Mohamed, 18, from London, and Sam Carrick, also 18 and from Gosport, the project was a chance to think about their place in the world and how they and others are viewed. “I hope someone reads it and feels understood,” says Ayat.Illustrator Vicki Jones, 21, from Birmingham, was keen for her work to be seen by the people she depicts, often women of colour. “The message I’d like people to take from my work is to be proud of who you are regardless of skin colour, facial features or hair type,” she says. “To just love the way you look. I am passionate about this message and I want others to feel that they can be heard too.”For the two photographers, Milli Ahern, 23, from London, and Fanny Beckman, 25, lockdown meant the biggest adjustment, forcing them to think creatively about what they could shoot in and around their homes, and they responded with positivity. “I was beyond excited when I found out I was chosen to work on this zine,” says Fanny, who is from Malmö, Sweden, but lives in London. “To get advice from people in the industry I have always dreamed of being part of means a lot to me.”“We received hundreds and hundreds of applications,” says the project’s casting editor Anna Fielding. “Every single person who applied had something important to say. The eight collaborators have exceptional clarity of expression and a real drive to see a new world. They’ve been inspirational to work with.”Although it has never been easier to self-publish work, or create a social media presence or a podcast, it’s difficult to be heard among so many others doing the same.The reach of an established newspaper still matters, as does being heard by an audience beyond your peer group.  Labs and Levi’s were happy to turn over creative control and act as supporters and signal-boosters. The hope is that the conviction and passion displayed by these eight will inspire others to find their voices. The collaborators were paid for their time and work, and will be mentored for six months by  Labs staff.Beyond encouraging young people to speak out and push for positive change, the aim is to let the world see the power of their potential. “We want to create a platform that this team perhaps otherwise wouldn’t have had. And then to put it in front of people who might not otherwise read it, because it would have been in places they wouldn’t normally look,” says Jason.The team may be only eight strong, but they represent their generation and they represent Britain. Do look at what they have to say: it contains the seeds of our future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects. So why is it so hard for her to find people to identify with in the media?I’m a Gen Z Muslim woman with immigrant parents and I don’t fit many stereotypes. Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse. We all need role models and there are lots of us who are being let down.It’s up to all of us to fix that. Starting now. Here, five people reveal how they’re breaking boundaries in race, mental health, body image, religion and age representation ...Malin Andersson“Mental health representation will make us all stronger,” says Malin Andersson, a mental health advocate and TV personality.I talk about grief, depression, body positivity, and domestic violence on my Instagram to open up those conversations. I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong. I want to see different types of beauty in the media.Stephanie Yeboah“If I’d seen someone who looked like me, I would’ve had less self-hate issues,” says body positivity blogger Stephanie Yeboah.“I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance.

Photograph: Crispin RodwellOver the summer public transport officials held a series of meetings with employer groups and third level colleges, facing an unprecedented need to gauge passenger demand from next month as “normal” post-summer life resumes.The problem of course is that life will not return as normal. Trains, trams and busses will operate much differently and planners must consider what transport in Ireland will look like toward the end of 2020 and into 2021.With strict social distancing requirements slashing capacity and many thousands of people planning to remain working from home, the focus will be on those who have no choice but to get back on board.Detailed data obtained by The  shows very clearly the cataclysmic effect Covid-19 has had on public transport use, at one point shedding about 90 per cent as society shut down to contain the virus.Looming concerns will include the relationship between demand and supply public safety how commuters might be persuaded to change their travel patterns and the prospect of more people opting for private cars.The challenges for what might come are best understood by looking at what has happened so far – in early March, the national transport network came to a grinding halt. As Ireland locked itself away, only a scattering of essential workers climbed on board carriages and buses, making their way to work through empty streets, enjoying a near perfectly functioning system.Its data is stark, illustrated on graphs, as with most things related to the pandemic, by a precipitous downward curve.Transport use by numbersAs a whole, daily PSO (public service) passenger numbers dropped from more than 950,000 at the very beginning of March, to consistently, and often well below 100,000, between the end of March and into May. On March 5th, just before the plummeting decline, the country’s first clusters of coronavirus were confirmed.A swift and steady collapse followed. By the very end of that month, when transport use dipped and remained steadily below the 100,000 figure, it coincided with then taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s appeal to the nation to stay at home.The so-called 2km rule was introduced, all but emptying public transport vehicles, with the only travel exceptions permitted for health, social care or other essential work as well as shopping for food or attending medical appointments.A seven day rolling average of the data – which flattens out the peaks and troughs of weekend and weekday usage – shows that Dublin Bus, which had carried by far the largest number of commuters of all services before the pandemic, began to grow consistently beyond the 100,000 mark in early June.This occurred just as Ireland was entering phase two of the lifting of Covid-19 related movement restrictions.By April and early May, Luas usage had shrank to as low as 3 and 4 per cent of its late February level. On March 10th, it had almost 142,000 passenger journeys compared to just under 5,500 on April 18th (a Tuesday and Saturday respectively).Similarly, Bus Éireann had dropped to as low as 5 per cent of passenger use when comparing mid-April with early March. 118,000 passengers on Friday, February 28th, had fallen to 14,700 by Friday, April 17th.On Monday, March 9th, Irish Rail recorded slightly over 198,500 passengers, but by Monday, April 13th, it was just over 2,000.The rural Local Link bus service has seen the fastest recovery during the Covid emergency, having already arrived back at the level of use it experienced in early March.Uncertain futureAnd yet, recovery across the network is not straightforward – accompanying an ongoing social discomfort and wariness, is the Government mandate that each inidual vehicle can only be used to half its capacity.Exactly how the network responds or bounces back in the coming months will depend on a complex interplay of demand, capacity, inidual confidence and what many believe will be a shifting culture in work habits.“Will the long distance commute be changed permanently? I think that’s possible,” said Mr Gaston. “On the other hand, people might find that working from home isn’t that great and might want to go into the office.”September will tell, or begin to tell, but immediately travellers will be faced with the measures that Irish transport authorities have put in place. Aside from capacity reduction, Ireland was one of the first countries to use seat covers with concise Covid-19 messaging across the network.Daily cleaning was introduced, as was protection for drivers. Since July face coverings became mandatory and compliance, according to officials, has been very high.While the system seems primed, efforts are well under way to try and understand what it might have to contend with, in so far as that is possible.The NTA has had a number of meetings with employers groups including Ibec and Chambers Ireland, as well as with third level educational institutions. The idea is not just to try and gauge how many people might be standing on platforms and at bus stops from early September, but to try and encourage a shift in behaviour that would keep limited capacity free for those with limited capacity to alter their travelling timetables.There have already been shifts. In the Covid era, people have been increasingly travelling at quieter times, notably between 10am to 2pm. Although there is less capacity on the network, this fanning out of commuter demand would greatly increase efficiency in the use of what capacity is available.Transit authorities in a number of countries are beginning to send out a similar message.“Behaviours can be changed if people understand the reasons for it and if it still provides the services that they need.”October and November will be an early test – these are traditionally the busiest months on public transport with workers less inclined to take holidays and students in classes full time.Commuter flexibilityThe NTA has raised the issue of working hour flexibility, particularly now that a grand experiment has proved the ability for large swathes of the working population to do so from home, even if just on a part time or shared basis.“The strong sense that we are getting is that there will not be the same massive return in September of workers.”However, the question of Irish transport and population mobility is more complicated than what happens in the coming months and Covid has thrown it into sharp, often urgent focus.The urgency for some comes in the form of private car use which had come back much faster than public transport for obvious reasons (although Mr Gaston said this had levelled off against a slow but steady rise in public transport).Faced with similar problems, Transport For London recently acknowledged the post-recovery need for “safe space for people to use active, sustainable and socially distanced modes of travel”, that would help prevent a “damaging car-led recovery”.“We must avoid a car-led recovery which would cause gridlock and only make things worse,” said transport commissioner Andy Byford. “So my message to Londoners returning to public transport is we are doing everything to keep things clean and safe for everyone.”Conor Faughnan, director of consumer affairs at the AA, said while the roads were extremely quiet on the June bank holiday weekend, the August bank holiday was almost the same as last year. While the private car is in resurgence, much like public transport the next couple of months will be the true test.So far, noted Mr Faughnan, there has been no return to morning rush hour traffic and businesses are still working out what to do with employees.“There may be some sort of new paradigm,” he said. “We will just have to wait and see.”OpportunityDavid O’Connor, transport expert and assistant head of school at TU Dublin Environment and Planning, believes Covid has brought about an opportunity for the sector.He sets out an immediate future of fewer passengers, higher costs and a work operating environment that for safety and health concerns, could make more people inclined to opt for the shelter of their own cars.“They are putting in cycling and walking measures but they should also be looking at putting in public transport measures as well,” he said.“As a planner I can see that everything is changing the rule book has been almost thrown out.”The performance of public transport timetables during the pandemic lockdown offered a brief taste to Irish commuters, albeit a small number of them, of how networks operate in cities like Zurich and Stockholm, he said. A positive legacy of this 21st century pandemic could be transport investment.“The idea behind Bus Connects becomes even more strategic,” he said, adding that the time is arguably now to embrace “smoothed travel patterns”, essentially doing away with two rush hour peaks redesigning transport vehicles to give passengers greater space and providing hand sanitiser to compliment the wearing of masks.“The most important thing is to do this carefully. We have to look to the future I think there will be a different set of urban economics when we come out of this. Not everybody is going to go into work five days a week.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332602.1597699376!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"calls for review of leaving cert grading system as cabinet to discuss new covid restrictions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin and the Labour Party urged Minister for Education Norma Foley to explain how the Irish system would not mean the same level of grades being marked down. File photograph: GettyOpposition parties last night called for a review of the Government’s plan after the British government made a U-turn on A-level results, abandoning its standardisation process when students learned that up to 40 per cent of the grades estimated by their teachers had been marked down by the process.The Government has a similar process for estimating grades, taking into account the teachers’ predicated grades, but also a series of other factors including a school’s previous results.Sinn Féin and the Labour Party urged Minister for Education Norma Foley to explain how the Irish system would not mean the same level of grades being marked down.Sources said that the Opposition parties were briefed on the process for estimating grades two weeks ago but were only offered general assurances about the system.Sinn Féin’s Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire said the UK experience “raises enormous questions for the calculated grades process here”.He warned that the Irish system could mean students from disadvantaged schools that have a history of lower results “are very worried that they will have their results dragged back because of where they are or what school they went to”.Labour spokesman for education Aodhán Ó Ríordáin said the Government was operating an “it’ll be grand” approach to calculated grades and schools reopening.Following controversies in Britain there was now a “galloping momentum” to review the calculated grades process in Ireland, said Mr Ó Ríordáin.“What we need to know from the Minister is why our system won’t have the same problems as the UK system,” said Mr Ó Ríordáin. He said Ms Foley should appear at the Oireachtas Covid-19 committee this week to answer questions about the system.A spokesman for the Department of Education said Ms Foley was aware of the policy developments around grades in the UK on Monday, but reiterated the Irish system “will treat students fairly and equitably”.The Irish process was working from estimated percentage marks provided by teachers, rather than grades as in the UK, said the spokesman. This would give officials working on the standardisation of results “considerably more detailed information about students for use in the calculated grades process”, he said.“Strong measures have been put in place to identify and reward exceptional students from schools that typically in the past would have performed at average or below average levels.”Coronavirus restrictionsMeanwhile, a full Cabinet meeting has been scheduled for this morning at short notice, leading to speculation that further restrictions to combat the recent rise in cases could be introduced. One political source suggested new enforcement measures may be on the cards, requiring the approval of the full Cabinet.However, it is understood there will be no further county lockdowns arising from the meeting.It was previously expected that only the Cabinet sub-committee on Covid-19 would meet would meet on Tuesday to discuss the latest recommendations from the National Public Health Emergency Team, which held a lengthy meeting on Monday to discuss the recent increase in case numbers and the merits of any new restrictions.Political sources said that further restrictions on nursing home visits could be introduced, while trends in testing, and current outbreaks in meat plants and other facilities are also set to be on the Cabinet agenda.It has also emerged that about 28,000 people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will receive no benefit from Tuesday after failing to confirm their continued eligibility for the scheme.Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said the payment continued to be a “vital source of income” for thousands of iniduals, but “resources are not unlimited and we need to ensure that this money goes to the people and families who genuinely need it”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 target"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

About 28,000 people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will receive no benefit from tomorrow, after failing to confirm their continued eligibility for the scheme, the Department of Social Protection has said.The number of people claiming the payment fell to 232,400 this week, a decrease of 61 per cent from the peak of 598,000 in early May. The scheme, which provides €350 per week for most recipients, was introduced in March to aid those who lost their jobs as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.In recent weeks, the department had contacted around 390,000 PUP claimants asking them to confirm their continuing eligibility for the payment.At the beginning of last week, about 29,000 had not confirmed their continued eligibility “despite having received personal notifications on four separate occasions” up to August 9th, the department said.By Friday, August 14th, about 1,000 confirmed their eligibility for the PUP, and they will continue to receive their payment. The remaining 28,000 will not receive a payment as their PUP claim is now deemed closed. However, anybody who is eligible but did not confirm their eligibility by the deadline can have their payment restored by re-applying online.Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys, said the payment continues to be a “vital source of income” for thousands of iniduals and families.“Our resources are not unlimited and we need to ensure that this money goes to the people and families who genuinely need it,” Minister Humphreys said.“My Department has made every effort to contact every person receiving the payment in recent weeks in order to confirm their continued eligibility.

Photograph: Ander Gillenea  AFP A surge in demand for Covid-19 tests has led to a slowdown in the State’s test and trace system, which is now taking almost four days on average to complete.As infections have climbed around the country, the time taken from referral for a test to the completion of contact tracing calls has gone from three days on average at the start of the month to 3.8 days in the latest data published on Monday.Turnaround times are also being slowed by significant increases in the number of close contacts that must be traced, with up to 50 iniduals being traced from a single positive case in some instances.Experts recommend that the entire end-to-end process should take less than three days, and the HSE has a target of completing the entire process within three days in 90 per cent of cases.A HSE spokeswoman said on Monday evening that a “slight slowdown” in turnaround times was being driven by a “large increase in a short timefame in the number of Covid-19 swabs being tested”.Also, more people are presenting for tests from the community, rather than from residential settings like nursing homes, or from within the healthcare system, the HSE said, while there had been “an increase in close contact referral from positive cases”.Serial testing of staff at nursing homes, recommended by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and a new programme of testing at meat processing plants, is also having an impact. With more positive tests being returned, at about 2 per cent of all swabs taken, there are more calls to be made by contact tracers.Complex settingsThe number of close contacts that must be traced is rapidly increasing, from about two to three on average during lockdown to between five and six.On August 4th, when test and trace took three days, contact tracers were making 260 calls per day. This has increased to more than 800 per day in recent days, which “is likely to cause an increase in time to complete all contact tracing calls for positive cases”.In order to make these calls, contact-tracing centres operated by the Revenue Commissioners in Limerick and Dublin began operations over the weekend, along with the Army band. A centre in UCD, which had been stood down, recommended operations on August 9th.On Monday, Early Childhood Ireland, which represents childcare providers, said it feared delays in Covid-19 testing would have serious implications on maintaining the necessary staff ratios to keep services in place.CEO Teresa Heeney said: “We’re told that testing occurs, on average, within 48 hours, however with the reported delays, childcare staff who display symptoms could be waiting up a week to be tested and to receive results.“Having staff out for such a duration would put huge pressure on childcare providers’ ability to maintain the legal staff to child ratios and would also be a huge public health concern.“This has a knock-on effect on providers being able to keep specific rooms open, and potentially the entire setting functioning fully.”The NPHET’s latest figures on Monday showed there were no further deaths from Covid-19 but an additional 56 confirmed cases of the virus in the State. This followed an additional 266 confirmed cases over the weekend.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"US president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Four low-ranking members of the Shia Muslim Hezbollah political party are accused of killing the former prime minister and 21 others in a massive bombing in 2005Two countries taking steps towards normal relations with telephone links and flightsPutin suggestion came after Trump said he would trigger a \u0026lsquosnapback\u0026rsquo of sanctionsAs inquiry into Beirut blast gets under way, rescue of country not ruling class urgedThursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

Marks obtained during the lockdown period were not taken into account.Jean-Michel Blanquer, the French education minister, called the system “the most simple, secure and fair solution in these difficult times”.This has forced the French government to create about 10,000 extra university places for the most popular subjects. Jean Castex, the prime minister, called the results generous. They marked the highest rise in pass rates since 1968 after huge student strikes ended in marks based on continuous assessment with an 80 per cent success rate - some 20 per cent higher than the previous year.Gilles Roussel, head of France’s university presidents’ conference, CPU, denied the Bac was devalued this year as places were anyway based on marks throughout the previous year and “often the first term”. Students would have to play catch-up on certain subjects, however, he added.In neighbouring Germany, all 16 states decided to push ahead with their end-of-year Abitur qualifications after heated debate.While schools were closed during the March-June exam period, small groups of pupils sat tests at a distance of 1.5 metres in well-aired classrooms instead of halls.Despite the different approach,  most German states also reported higher than usual results. Fears that stress and health concerns could affect performance proved baseless. Indeed, experts speculated that pupils may have been able to focus more due to a lack of distractions.The Netherlands, too, recorded a higher pass rate after its central school-leaving exams were cancelled, with schools awarding final marks on the basis of course work and the schools’ own tests, which pupils were also allowed to resit.While almost five times as many high schools as usual reported a 100 per cent pass rate, according to one survey, the education ministry dismissed claims that the exams had been devalued.“This group of pupils had to take school exams under unexpected and difficult circumstances,” a spokeswoman told the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, adding that the cancellation of the central exams meant pupils had more time to study for the school exams.For Spain\u0027s Selectividad university entrance exams, candidates chose three out of a selection of five questions and were not tested on anything learned during lockdown. Each region was responsible for creating its own coronavirus exam procedure.The pass rate across the country was within one percentage point of 2019, aside from students in northern Catalonia, hard-hit by the virus, where a majority of them did significantly better than in 2019. Some 67 per cent more scored above nine – out of a possible 10 – than in the previous year.In Italy, around 500,000 students took only the oral part of their high-school diploma while wearing face masks but the normal three written tests were cancelled. Marks were generally higher than in previous years amid reports of “generous” examiners who awarded the maximum possible score in 9.9 per cent of cases, compared with just 5.6 per cent in 2019.The Czech Republic and Slovakia postponed end-of-school exams.Sweden, meanwhile, is set to cancel the second round of  its scholastic aptitude tests, which helps many get places at university after scrapping the first round in March.They are likely to be replaced by two exams in 2021 instead, the education ministry said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain should abandon shielding iran","story":"Two peace deals in the Middle East are at issue. The first, announced last Thursday, is the normalisation of relations between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel. The UAE is only the third Arab state (after Egypt and Jordan) ever to go this far, so this is a breakthrough. Its price is the suspension of Benjamin Netanyahu’s controversial plan to annex Israel’s West Bank settlements.The UAE-Israel deal follows an emerging pattern. Several Arab countries no longer treat the Palestinian cause as their political and moral priority. They want peace, and they see Iran as a much bigger threat to peace than Israel. We have recently witnessed similar emotions on the streets of Beirut after the dreadful explosion there. Citizens protested about the ruination of their country by Iran’s proxy, Hezbollah. Boris Johnson has reacted enthusiastically to the UAE-Israel accord, but the Foreign Office is known to worry about “polarisation” in the region.The second peace deal in question is the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and several countries, including the United States, Britain, Germany and France. This gave Iran international respectability with which to cloak its nuclear intentions. It came up again last week because, on Friday, the UN Security Council rejected America’s attempt to renew the 2007 arms embargo on Iran.Only one other country supported the United States. Britain – despite private mutterings about “no compromise” over Iran – preferred to take the “European” view, and joined France in abstaining, thus helping Russia and China and isolating America – not such a brilliant idea when we are in the middle of negotiating a trade deal.As a result, the US says it will invoke “snap back” rules under the JCPOA, which allow any of the Security Council permanent members to reimpose sanctions on Iran. This is piquant, since it is America which repudiated the deal it is now invoking. It argues, however, that it remains a participant. Will Britain and France, both permanent members, want to squash the US, undermining that permanent-member right and thus the Security Council itself? An undignified diplomatic tussle will ensue.One suspects Britain is hedging its bets, waiting for a Biden administration. Understandable, perhaps, though scarcely certain. But the larger question is: “Does our Middle Eastern policy want to be on the wrong side of history?” We flatter ourselves with the old Foreign Office dream that our diplomatic skills can seduce regime “moderates”, thus preventing Iran falling into the arms of China.There is no discernible evidence for this. Like the Russian revolution of 1917, the Iranian revolution of 1979 has done Britain nothing but harm. More generally, that revolution – and the Islamist violence it promotes – has spread destruction and instability through and beyond the region for more than 40 years. Why shield it?Our policy towards Iran will probably resemble that on Huawei. At first, we pointlessly hold out against US pressure. Then we recognise the facts and do shamefacedly and late what we should have done confidently and much earlier. Some universities, I believe, still have something called an “aegrotat”. It used to be common. “Aegrotat” is Latin for “Heshe is ill”. An aegrotat degree is awarded to any student who is a) too ill to take the exams and b) considered by the university to have an academic record which means that heshe would have got a degree if illness had not struck. No attempt is made to classify the degree as a first, a second or a third: it is simply stated as “BA Hons (aegrotat)”. This has usually been recognised by employers.The idea behind the aegrotat is that it usually makes little sense to award grades to people for an exam they have not been able to take, but that this should not be held against them. This is the situation facing the national generation of A-Level and GCSE pupils this year. Most of them are not ill, of course, but pandemic illness has had the same effect.The problem is that, to get into universities, pupils need grades. Right now, this entails grade inflation. This is in principle a bad thing: this year’s teacher assessment average is 12 per cent above last year’s, which does not represent reality. It is fairer, however, than iniduals being deprived of an opportunity by an algorithm about which they can do nothing. Morally, it is a bit like the Government paying for furlough during Covid – undesirable, but necessary. Yesterday, the Government in effect recognised this, accepted predictive grades and binned the Ofqual scheme.Everyone is rightly asking why Ofqual, ministers and education professionals both in England and Scotland did not see this coming months ago. I fear one must also ask that of the media, including commentators such as myself.We journalists, after all, are supposed to apply the common sense that bureaucrats tend to ignore. We try to foresee problems by testing general systems against inidual cases. In this case, very few of us did. Yet it ought to have been obvious that any pupil getting a lower grade solely because of an algorithm would feel cheated: the very idea of reward for good work had been chucked. In some cases – such as not getting into a good university – the damage can be life-changing.

It came in the opening third of the convention and chimed with the heart of Mr Biden’s strategy for winning back the White House - wooing moderate voters tempted by Mr Trump four years ago. He said he had ticked the Trump box in 2016 but regretted it now. “I challenge you to think back to what made you vote for Donald Trump back in November 2016”, Eric said in a direct message to his fellow Republicans. He referenced the crises of the pandemic and the economic crash, calling this election “bigger than any political party” and adding: “We have a chance to look ourselves in the mirror and go vote for a proven leader.”If Mr Biden wins back the Rust Belt that Mr Trump flipped from blue to red in 2016 it could well be thanks to voters like Eric, white men who were swayed by the Trump pitch at the last election but have since become disillusioned. These normal voters gave the convention’s first night a human feel and some grounding in a programme that risked appearing stilted with speeches given by politicians standing alone without the usual backdrop of cheering crowds. Coronavirus ruined the Democrats’ original plans to hold an in-person gathering in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the mould of the conventions of old. There were fears that in its place would be something more boring and less engaging. In fact, if night one is anything to go by, what emerged instead was two hours of tight broadcasting which may well have kept the prime-time US television audience’s attention much better than the full-day conventions of the past. Speeches were kept short. Instead of politicians milking the limelight by spending minutes of their speech explaining their personal story - with one eye on future elections - they made their points quick and then wrapped up. Andrew Cuomo, the New York governor, appeared in his now familiar Covid-19 briefing set-up, with slides and all, to ram home his belief that the US president had failed the moment.Jim Clyburn, the South Carolina congressman whose endorsement is widely seen as the turning point in Mr Biden’s Democratic primary tussle - he won the state, his first in the campaign, just days later - focussed on the “we know Joe” line, a message of reassurance. There were touches of glitz. Eva Longoria, the Desperate Housewives star, hosted the proceedings dressed in white, acting as a guide as she moved from one item to the next and weaved in the night’s theme of “we the people”. Megan Rapinoe, the US football team’s World Cup star, led a discussion. Wyclef Jean performed a bizarre song at the official pre-convention event talking about “smoking grass” with Bernie Sanders and running for president.There were also elements which struggled to connect. After each big speech, in an attempt to mask the lack of an audience, the camera cut to random supporters watching at home who applauded silently, some looking a little uncomfortable. But throughout the two hours a tight focus in message was kept on painting Mr Biden as a man of empathy, who rose up from the middle classes and - in what Democrats claim is a contrast to Mr Trump - understands what people are going through right now. One especially effective video showed an old Amtrak worker describing how Mr Biden, travelling back and forth constantly from Delaware to Washington DC while a senator to look after his children after their mother died, became a friend.  He said when he got ill Mr Biden, then vice president, called to check in on him. The voter videos - of farmers who face losing their livelihoods in the recession to couples who are struggling to get postal ballots and mothers who fear for their children’s return to school - backed up exactly that image. People, polls suggest, are more swayed by the views of a friend than any other message carrier during an election campaign.The voice of everyday folks, more than the Democratic Party’s cream of the crop, may prove to be the most effective bit of this week’s convention. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"smartphones could soon letting us know had much drink","story":"Sometimes, it takes a friend to tell you when you\u0027ve had one drink too many – but in the future, your smartphone could do that for you.Researchers in the US have trialled a method for phones to detect drunkenness by monitoring the wobbliness of a user\u0027s walk.They identified future uses for the technology, including phones sending a message warning someone not to get behind the wheel or engage in unprotected sex, and another to indicate when the drinker has sobered up.In the case of alcoholics on treatment programmes, alerts could be sent to their sponsors to warn that they had fallen off the wagon.In the controlled study, undertaken by the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, 22 adults aged between 21 and 43 were given a drink containing vodka and mixer and told to finish it within an hour. The alcohol concentration was 0.2 per cent, with the legal limit for driving in the US 0.08 per cent.A smartphone was secured to each participant\u0027s lower back with an elastic belt and hourly, for seven hours, they were asked to walk in a straight line for 10 steps before turning around and walking 10 steps back.The phones measured acceleration plus vertical, mediolateral (side to side) and anteroposterior (forward and backward) movements while the participants walked.About 90 per cent of the time, researchers were able to use changes in gait to identify when participants\u0027 breath-alcohol concentration exceeded the drink-drive limit, according to the study, published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs.Dr Brian Suffoletto, the lead researcher, said smartphones had the ability to play a greater role in people\u0027s well-being, adding: We have powerful sensors we carry around with us everywhere we go. We need to learn how to use them to best serve public health.This controlled lab study showed that our phones can be useful to identify \u0027signatures\u0027 of functional impairments related to alcohol.In five years, I would like to imagine a world in which, if people go out with friends and drink at risky levels, they get an alert at the first sign of impairment and are sent strategies to help them stop drinking and protect them from high-risk events like driving, interpersonal violence and unprotected sexual encounters.Dr Suffoletto, of Stanford University School of Medicine\u0027s department of emergency medicine, said he had lost a close friend at college in a drink-drive accident, and as an emergency physician, I have taken care of scores of adults with injuries related to acute alcohol intoxication. He added: Because of this, I have dedicated the past 10 years to testing digital interventions to prevent deaths and injury related to excessive alcohol consumption.Although placing a phone on the lower back does not reflect how people carry them in real life, the research team said it planned to conduct further research in which people carried phones in their hands and pockets.They said the proof of concept study provides a foundation for future research on using smartphones to remotely detect alcohol-related impairments.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/18/08/barack-obama-megan-thee-stallion.jpg","title":"barack obama summer playlist 2020 megan thee stallion chicks","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Billie Eilish,\u0026nbspBeyoncé and Princess Nokia also make appearances on annual listBarack Obama has announced his annual summer playlist for 2020, with Megan thee Stallion, Billie Eilish and The Chicks’ “Gaslighter” all making appearances.“Over the past few months, I’ve spent a lot of time listening to music with my family,” Obama wrote on his social media. “I wanted to share some of my favourites from the summer.“As always, it’s a mix of genres that travels through various eras.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”.

Several roads were closed and the surrounding area was cordoned off“I feel my life has been completely ruined, I can’t get into any universities with such grades or progress further in my life,” the New College Stamford student said. “I would like to know how this has happened.”In response, Mr Gibb, the schools minister for England, who was also appearing on the programme, said: I do feel for you. This should not have happened to you. We don\u0027t want you to have to go through this stress of having to go through an appeal to find out what’s going to happen to your career.“None of this is satisfactory, the best system is for people to take their exams – that’s what should have happened. It’s what we wanted to happen, but we had to take a very difficult decision in March to cancel exams and what we didn’t want was for young people like Nina to have to delay a year.”Starmer urges government to scrap ‘injustice’ of A-level results“The reason for the standardisation model is to ensure we have consistency between schools and we don’t have grade inflation.”Mr Gibb was then challenged over why the system was not working by BBC presenter Chris Mason, as the student told the minister “you have ruined my life”. But the education minister added: It won\u0027t ruin your life, it will be sorted I can assure you. The trouble with these models – when you have a model that standardises grades across the country there will be imperfections in it.”“That’s why we have introduced very robust appeals processes that schools will trigger for candidates like Nina. Those appeals will happen very swiftly and universities have said they will hold offers open until 7 September and we’re working through that now.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Africa’s forest elephants have been decimated by the illegal wildlife trade, with more than two thirds killed in the last decade. There was estimated to be around 90,000 left, with about half of that population believed to be in Gabon.However, a study by a 10-member international research team fears that the total remaining population could be between 40 to 80 percent smaller. The study, published in PLOS ONE, shows the urgency of The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, which calls for an international effort to clamp down on the illegal trade of wild animals.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFunds raised will pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animalsThe illegal trade of wild animals is the world’s fourth largest criminal enterprise, after arms, drugs and human trafficking.The forest elephant has been ruthlessly hunted by poachers in the rainforests of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Gabon. The ivory is smuggled to Asia where it is in high demand for intricate carving. However the full extent of the bloodshed has been hidden from the world’s gaze.Professor Lee White, Gabon’s Minister of Water, Forests, Oceans, Environment and Climate Change, welcomed The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign and said that the world must act now to end wildlife crime, to both protect forest elephants but also for greater global security.“The illegal trade of wildlife wreaks havoc in Africa and even threatens to destabilise whole countries,” White said. “The ivory trade is linked to terrorists and criminal syndicates who also smuggle gold, guns and people at Gabon’s border with Cameroon.”White says some poachers in Gabon “take a ‘shoot on sight’ approach” to confrontation with law enforcers, and have become “much more violent and threatening” in the past five years. “It is partly because we have become more professional and aggressive, but also because there’s now much more involvement of organised crime.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Biological anthropologist Nelson Ting co-led the study, which revised the population size by using a method known as genetic capture-recapture, which involves assessing dung piles. Ting said “Gabon was thought to be a population stronghold, but even our most optimistic results suggest a smaller population size. Our research shows how endangered they really are. “Forest elephants are among the most threatened animals. More information is key to figuring out the best ways to prevent extinction.”Forest elephants are the smaller, rarer cousins of the giant savannah elephant, and their densely wooded habitat makes them harder to study and count.White, a biologist born in Manchester, spent his childhood in Uganda where he developed a passion for elephants. “Tragically, nobody had noticed that Gabon had lost about a third of its forest elephants. You can’t fly over and see the carcasses because they’re hidden”As poachers continued to empty the country of its forest elephants, White spearheaded a war against them - and against ivory trafficking in particular.The threat to forest elephants has been greatly reduced, but danger still looms large. Gabon has maintained its usual level of frontline protection throughout the Covid pandemic in case of any upturn. Elephants can also be killed during conflict with local people, often after trampling or eating crops. Space for Giants is working with the National Parks Agency and Assala Energy over three years to build 23 miles of electrified farm boundary fences to keep elephants from danger, and to protect people’s livelihoods.Several fences have already been completed. These types of projects provide local communities with a sustainable way to earn a living, and are designed to incentivise the communities to help protect their primary source of undeveloped wealth capital, Gabon’s rich bioersity and forest elephants.White was appointed to Gabon’s cabinet by President Ali Bongo Ondimba, whom he calls “one of the planet’s greenest heads of state”, and today he works to not only save forest elephants for their own sake, but to also protect the health of the whole planet.Space for Giants Founder and CEO Dr Max Graham explains: “Forest elephants are incredibly important for the health of our whole ecosystem and in fighting global warming. “They play a role in the dispersal of seeds, which have to go through their gut to germinate, and the unique way in which they forage creates a forest canopy structure that is perfect for carbon sequestration. “They take out the young growth and leave what is longstanding, which has been attributed to creating carbon stock worth billions.”The survival of forest elephants is a human issue, inextricably linked to issues around environment, poverty, law enforcement and finance.White believes that international effort is needed to end the poaching war being waged against Africa, and that wildlife crime needs to become a new global priority in order to protect species and prevent another global pandemic.“If we don’t deal with the illegal wildlife trade we’ll have criminal and terrorist groups rampaging across the continent, destabilising countries,” says White. “But we also cannot continue to aggress nature and think there will be no price to pay. “If we continue to cut down forests, kill animals and destroy ecosystems the consequences will be catastrophic. We must be stewards of nature if we want it to keep being friendly”.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a particularly cold June morning in northern Kenya when rangers working in Loisaba Nature Conservancy first spotted a large male elephant limping near a watering hole. The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHowever the impact of Covid-19 means help is urgently needed to protect elephants against an increased threat of slaughter.In 2015 Space for Giants worked with international conservation organisation The Nature Conservancy to establish Loisaba as a conservation trust in perpetuity, protecting a critical habitat for a ersity of endangered species.Covering an area of 57,000 acres in the county of Laikipia, Loisaba has an increasing resident population of elephants, estimated at around 800, as well as an abundance of other fauna, including more than 260 bird species and 57 mammals, such as lions, leopards and cheetahs.Space for Giants supports wildlife monitoring, security and conservancy management in Loisaba, financed by The Nature Conservancy and other donors, including San Diego Zoo. The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

It was established in April , bringing together health specialists from more than  organisations into a single body. Over , staff, mainly scientists, researchers and public health professionals are employed by PHE. It has eight local centres across Englands regions, with one in London. The body provides government, local government, the NHS, parliament, industry and the public with evidence-based professional, scientic expertise and support.PHE are responsible for protecting the nation from public health hazards as well as preparing for and responding to public health emergencies. The agency aims to improve the health of the whole population by sharing their expertise as well as identying and preparing for future public health challenges.PHE manages a range of campaigns that pharmacies are involved in such as the stop-smoking campaigns Stoptober and Quit Kits, and the Be Clear on Cancer early diagnosis campaign. The body ensures that effective arrangements are in place nationally and locally to respond to health protection concerns, such as climate change. PHE researches, collects and analyses data to improve our collective understanding of public health challenges, and they try to come up with answers to health problems. The Health Secretary has ordered a major shake-up following heavy criticism of PHEs failure to prepare for the spread of coronavirus with stocks of protective gear and testing equipment.Officials have been accused of spending too much time lecturing the public on eating and drinking habits instead of preparing to protect against a looming pandemic.Health officials in Whitehall are furious with PHE for counting all deaths from Covid-, rather than those within the first  days of contracting the virus, as in Scotland.A merger of PHE with NHS Test and Trace will be announced - to form a new body called the National Institute for Health Protection. It will be modelled on Germanys Robert Koch Institute, which used an independent agency to take control of the countrys response to the pandemic.The chief executive of the new body will report directly to Mr Hancock and the governments chief scientic officer Sir Patrick Vallance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They will have to do the same for GCSE pupils who need certain grades for selective sixth form colleges and schools. General secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said Geoff Barton told The Times: “We are concerned about the potential impact on schools and colleges of processing large numbers of appeals over A-level results just at the time that they are also managing theof all students and the complex set of safety measures involved.“Some colleges report that they need to deal with hundreds of inidual appeals, all of which will be a major distraction for leaders and teachers.“This pressure will mount further following GCSE results on Thursday, which are also likely to generate many appealsteacher-assessed grades are once again moderated down. Any appeals process must be simple, swt and free from bureaucracy so that the opening of schools and colleges remains the priority.”Will Baldwin, Head of Brighton, Hove and Sussex Sixth Form College - one of the largest in the country with , students - said he simply did not have the resources to deal with appeals and getting schools ready. He said: “We do not have the capacity to deal with the volume of A-level appeals we know are forthcoming, when we know we are about to be dealing with hundreds of GCSE applicants who may have not reached the threshold required for enrolment, while preparing to reopen for all students in a Covid-safe way in September. We simply do not have the capacity.“I would like to say managing our appeals and GCSE applicants will not jeopardise the safe reopening of college but unfortunately doing everything is an impossible task.”Boris Johnson has said repeatedly schools will reopen in September for all pupils - no matter what. Schools have told been by the PM it is their moral duty to make sure kids are back in classrooms but a range of measures, including staggered arrival and departure times, dferent lunch breaks, one-way systems and other social distancing measures require teachers to spend a lot of time readying them for the first day back.But rules on how to apply for an appeal for the thousands of devastated A-level kids who had the results downgraded because of the computer generated standardisation.Ofqual issued guidance on Saturday afternoon and then hastily withdrew it. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is facing pressure to resign after his promised triple lock safety net, which would let kids rely on their mock exams in an appeal, fell apart.Many teachers are demanding students should be able to rely on their predicted grades. GCSE students are facing a similar fiasco and could lose out on spots at schools. Mr Williamson said the Government expects all schools back open and has even threatened to use emergency Covid- powers to force them to reopen. Parents will be finedthey do not send their children back without a good medical reason. Head teacher of South Hampstead High School said: At some pointwe need to get ready for GCSEs and the long-awaitedof all pupils in September. The appeals process is really important, but the fallout from results is a major distraction from preparing for September. I’ve never known anything like it in  years of teaching.”Kids have already missed out on six months of schools even after Boris Johnson scrapped plans in June to allow all primary years to go back before the summer holidays.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is what we are doing today,” said Anna Popova.The countrys health ministry says the jab - named after the Russian crafts launched during the Space Race - will provide immunity for two years.Leading scientists blasted Putin as recklish and foolish after he claimed Russia now has the worlds first coronavirus vaccine and that his own daughter has already been given it.The jab is still in the final stages of trials to test whether it is effective and safe, but the announcement could be a step towards rolling out a mass vaccination program.Russia has said it plans to produce million doses inside the country before the end of the year, and that it could also produce up to million doses abroad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If anything was going on we didn’t want to know.He added they also turned down some requests by Epstein to smuggle guests onto the island by boat, but Maxwell allegedly told them what Jeffrey wants, Jeffrey gets.The couple quit in  after Epstein was arrested in Florida the previous year - later being sentenced to  months in jail for solicitation of prostitution.The couple also claimed during their very first visit to the island during an interview they had to leave due to a VIP guest arriving, later being told that it was also Prince Andrew.Prince Andrew is claimed to have first met Andrew in  after being introduced to him by Maxwell, who he knew from her time in the UK.Little Saint James is the centre of many claims about Epsteins revolving door of young girls who Maxwell and others are alleged to have procured for him to abuse.Andrew strongly denies any allegations against him and said he had no knowledge of any wrongdoing while friends with Maxwell and Epstein.The Duke of York is accused of sleeping with Epstein sex slave Virginia Roberts at Maxwells townhouse in London in March  when she was just .The infamous picture allegedly showing Andrew, Ghislaine and Virginia together was taken on the same night.Andrew has said he has no memory of the photo being taken - and has suggested it could be a fake.She also claims to have had sex with Andrew at Epsteins mansion in New York and on his private island of Little Saint James.Andrew has admitted visiting the island once, but former staff and victims have claimed they saw him there on multiple occasions. Maxwell has been accused of taking part in the grooming and abuse of dozens of underage girls by Epstein.She is currently in prison awaiting her day in court after being arrested by the FBI in July and strongly denies all allegations.The current charges against her relate to allegations by three alleged victims in particular.She has pleaded not guilty, and her lawyers have accused the victims of trying to turn her into a scapegoat since the death of Epstein.Epstein killed himself in his cell at a New York prison in August last year while awaiting trial on charges - depriving many victims of justice.Victims allege they were duped with claims she was recruiting models of masseurs - only to them be abused by the Epstein and Maxwell.Cathy and Miles claim that Maxwell bragged to them she was the queen bee and the one in charge - describing her as being very friendly, but rather arrogant.

The pandemic has created circumstances no one could have ever imagined or wished for. We want to now take steps to remove as much stress and uncertainty for young people as possible - and to free up heads and teachers to work towards the important task of getting all schools open in two weeks.After reflection, we have decided that the best way to do this is to award grades on the basis of what teachers submitted. The switch to centre assessment grades will apply to both AS and A levels and to the GCSE results which students will receive later this week.There was no easy solution to the problem of awarding exam results when no exams have taken place. Ofqual was asked by the Secretary of State to develop a system for awarding calculated grades, which maintained standards and ensured that grades were awarded broadly in line with previous years. Our goal has always been to protect the trust that the public rightly has in educational qualications.But we recognise that while the approach we adopted attempted to achieve these goals we also appreciate that it has also caused real anguish and damaged public confidence. Expecting schools to submit appeals where grades were incorrect placed a burden on teachers when they need to be preparing for the new term and has created uncertainty and anxiety for students. For all of that, we are extremely sorry.We have therefore decided that students be awarded their centre assessment for this summer - that is, the grade their school or college estimated was the grade they would most likely have achieved in their exam - or the moderated grade, whichever is higher.The path forward we now plan to implement will provide urgent clarity. We are already working with the Department for Education, universities and everyone  affected by this issue.GCSE students are set to receive their results on August  - despite them missing exam season.Results day will not be delayed despite fears it would be. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Williamson said: They wont be fined and were removing those caps on every single university in the United Kingdom, so that they have the ability to expand the number of places, welcoming more students into those universities, as many as possible.His words suggest the Government will be encouraging unis to take as many people as they can.It will depend entirely on the university, but yes you should now be able to get a spot with your first choiceyou now have the correct marks.Last night the Government said it wanted universities to honour all the offers they had made, as long as students get the grades.Universities may still decide to give a student a placetheir new grades meet their offers.But its not yet clear whether they have a legal obligation to do this or it will depend on how nice they are feeling.But theres also the issue of space.Universities often offer more places than they have available because not all students given an offer will be able to make the grades required to take up the spot, and some will choose not to too.Even though the cap on numbers has been ripped up there are practical problems - such as space in lecture theatres and tutorial rooms - that could mean not everyone will get a place. You should be now able to get a place, but there is no guarantee of this.It will depend on your first choice university and whether they have the space for you.This means a huge scramble for kids to try and get a place swapped - while trying to make sure they keep their insurance offer in case that doesnt happen.Thousands of other kids have swiped up spots through clearing. The best thing that can be done will be to contact your uni with your new grades and send them proof of your teacher predicted marks.They will then be able to make a call on whether they have space for you.UCAS will be meeting with schools and universities to thrash out how to make decisions after the shambolic results process. A spokesperson said: “In response to the announcements across the UK regarding the awarding of A levels, UCAS is now working with universities, colleges and schools to support students to understand their options and achieve their place in higher education. “For those students who were not placed with their firmchoice university, our advice is that you don’t need to make your decision immediately. Once your university has your ‘Centre Assessed Grades ’ via exam bodies they can make a decision as to whether there is a place at your preferred choice.“We will be issuing new advice for students and schools and this will be sent directly to students as soon as they are able to take a decision.“UCAS is working with Universities UK and the education sector and whilst the decision is with the inidual university, we will do everything we can to support students to use their CAGs to secure the best possible outcome.”Universities have said they are waiting for further information on what this means. If universities do want to offer a place but they are now full up, they could offer a deferral until next year.While this is far from ideal, it means many will be able to go to uni in  instead.Mary Curnock Cook, formerly UCAS chief executive, told the BBC kids could have to take gap years because there simply isnt enough places at universities now.She said: There are literally tens of thousands of students who decisions have already been made about who they accept and dont accept.This change will mean that universities have to rethink completely.Many have filled their places rightly and now they are being asked to take in potentially tens of thousands of people moved back to their centre assessed grades.There will be some courses that are just physically full and may have to offer deferrals.However, poorer students who dont want to take a year off will face dficulty as the job market is crashing because of the coronavirus.And many kids thinking about travelling will be put off by quarantines and other restrictions which could limit their options.The University of York said: We are working hard to respond to the latest announcement from the UK Government about results for confirmation and clearing. We are awaiting further details and we will provide more information and guidance to students as soon as we can.Some universities will offered deferred spaces for next year because of lack of space in particular coursez. University College London has said they will accept all pupils given an offer, but are still working out how this will apply to courses such as medicine - which had a cap on numbers based on practical constraints.The London university said: UCL’s priority is to be as fair as possible to all applicants, recognising that they have worked hard during unprecedented circumstances and deserve their first choice university.  We are delighted to accept all students who meet the terms of their original offer on all programmes that do not have an externally-determined cap . For those students who have met our offer to study medicine based on teacher-assessed grades but do not yet have a place confirmed, we are working with the relevant agencies about places this year and we will guarantee a deferred place for next year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A stf of a game show dreamt up by Simon Cowell’s Over The Top Productions company and hosted by Stephen Mulhern, who charged on to the set, Saturday night, shouting: “Oh yes, I hope you’re ready. This is going to be good.”It wasn’t, obviously. It was going to be anything but good.Rolling In It is a show where every single thing is working against it being good, in fact, from the fixtures and fittings to the ropey old format where they’ve attempted to fuse the random “thrill” of Tipping Point with Who Wants To Be A Millionaire , minus the decent cash prize.The technology here isn’t exactly state of the art either. It’s an old arcade game. So, before answering  lobotomised questions , the contestants must roll a gigantic coin down a chute which can end up in a cash prize basket, but more often than not ends up bankrupting them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, as you’ve probably noticed, is currently playing exactly the same game with the British economy and probably thinks Rolling In It is a fantastic idea for a game show.ITV in its heart of hearts, though, clearly does not. How can you tell Because they’ve had to ditch the normal, run-of-the-mill contestants and partner-up some visibly reluctant ITV celebs with X Factor-style “characters” who are meant to ert your attention from the game.Saturday night, we had a live wire called Jana, who announced her arrival by telling Mulhern he’d “lost weight”. “What ”The week before there was another handful by the name of Lesley, who brought proceedings to a temporary halt, at the introductions’ stage, with this announcement. “I arrange funerals.”I’d stick around then, Lesley. I’ve checked this show’s vital signs and I think we’re talking weeks rather than months.I worry, too, about the long-term prospects of ITV in the current climate.The share price is down, advertising’s hit an all-time low, Ant  Dec are wintering in Rhyl and the new home for I’m A Celeb is literally a folly.The very remote possibility exists, I will admit, that Rolling In It is part of a deep-state plan to frighten everyone back to work — “Return to the office NOW, or you’re getting a second series of this rubbish.”But I don’t think we really need to look beyond the obvious lockdown explanation here.The cupboard is bare.ITV has simply run out of anything  worth showing, we’re now on to the stuff that was never meant to see the light of day, and as good as it’s ever going to get for Rolling In It is Gemma Collins revealing that: “My intuition is telling me shot put.”Then please go with your intuition, Gemma. Team GB demands it.Nasser Hussein: “The three non-negotiable players were Atherton, Stewart, Thorpe and Gough.”Paul Merson: “Every City signing is just another cog in the jigsaw.”Steven Gerrard: “The quality on the bench is the quality that’s not even on the bench.” BBC’S re-run of the original and arguably best Line Of Duty series concluded, last night, with the Organised Crime Gang still on the loose and DCI Tony Gates putting his tortured Irish wolfhound out of its misery before killing himself.The character I always feel sorry for, watching this  version of the show, though, is Jackie Laverty, Gates’ miserable girlfriend, who had her throat slit in the second episode.She was then stashed in Terry’s freezer, just behind the crispy pancakes and Cornettos, until her corpse was dramatically rediscovered in the fourth episode of the fth series, in April , looking almost as gormless as DI Buckells.In the process, she missed: The show’s big move to Belfast, in series two, the DI Denton years, with Keeley Hawes, balaclava man, Thandie Newton’s appearance, Ted Hastings’ long, dark nights of the soul at the Edge Park hotel, and DS Steve Arnott’s subtle transition from grey tank tops to lurid waistcoats, straight after he slept with DC Georgia Trotman at the beginning of the second run.I’d imagine Jackie actress Gina McKee casts a frosty stare or two in the direction of her agent as well.Line Of Duty may never have been so gloriously easy to understand, or free from abbreviations, as it was in series one, but while her character’s been solidying at Terry’s gaff it has become the most consistently brilliant drama of the decade.Sadly for her, Jackie Laverty is not actually due to defrost fully until series seven and the next runis going to be the last.No official word yet as to when that production will reach our screens but, you can guarantee already, Line Of Duty’s final episodes will be the television event of the year.BBC’s new sitcom Mandy  Well I came and I watched without laughing.

But her skills don’t stop at food. Suzanne says: “So many of us have hundreds of things whizzing around our heads.“Batching is arranging them into sets you can do together. Changing small things about mundane tasks can have a major effect.“It’s simple, saves time and money and gives you headspace.”Here, Suzanne reveals her top tips to “batch your le” by grouping tasks . . . DECIDING what to wear each day seems easy enough.Butyou have just ten minutes before getting the kids ready, it can actually be rushed and stressful.So, on a lazy Sunday afternoon, why not treat yourself to  minutes of your own time and get ahead Head upstairs and have a think about what you have coming up for each day of that coming week.Select an outfit for each of the days, evenit is just leggings and gym gear for some of them. In a very short time, you will find that you no longer have to stress as you jump out of bed in the morning.Can’t remember that nice outfit you wore last week but which made you feel great Simply snap a quick mirror photo of you dressed each morning.Then, on a Sundayyou are struggling for ideas, you can simply scroll back on outfits you liked wearing the week before.Doing this will help you feel ahead of the game and should make your mornings less frantic.LAST-MINUTE gt-buying can be expensive, as well as stressful and time-consuming.Make a list of all the birthdays you ought to know, then at the start of each month – or just after pay day – buy all the cards and presents in a single trip.Buying cards and wrapping paper in bulk, like I have here, left, is so much cheaper than buying them inidually from a corner shop.Wrap, label and even write the cards so they are ready to be handed out when needed.If you have kids constantly going to class parties, ask them to write a list of all the boys and girls, then allocate a cost for each child.Your children can choose an item for the boys and another for the girls. Buy these in bulk and keep them in a cupboard so you simply “grab and go” for each party, without having to constantly worry about the invites that come through the door.ARGH! No one likes going through their bills . . . and this job often gets put to one side until it mounts up.Why not spend  minutes putting them all together in a folder  Make a front page with a list of all bills and paperwork, with their due dates. Add a plastic wallet containing some stamps, paper and envelopes to the folder.Then look at your usual week and see when you might have some spare time.For example, I always have one hour on a Monday night while my kids play hockey. I keep this folder in the boot of the car then “batch” all my household bills and paperwork into this free period before posting them on the way home from hockey.As bills and paperwork come in through the letterbox, I add them to the folder and leave it until the following Monday.Another top tip is to sit down once every three months and look at what bills you can add to standing orders so they are automatically paid in smaller amounts.WITH emails and phone messages flooding in all the time, it is easy to feel overwhelmed. So batch them.Use your inbox only for anything that NEEDS to be done. All other correspondence can be moved into folders, eventhey are just to keep for reference.Set up separate email folders for work, home le and school so they are easy to find. Use the first  minutes of each working day to run through emails.File as many as possible and answer the easy ones. Click the “unsubscribe” box for emails from companies you do not wish to hear from so you receive less unwanted mail.Designate fixed times when you clear your inbox – say, after lunch and  minutes before the end of the working day. Less stress all round.I CAN hear the sceptical laughter already! But busy weeks often mean we never get to spend quality time with our partners.Booking in a time each week can work wonders for couples.Choose one night a week when you both make an effort to eat and chat together.Earmark the same night each week as “our night”. Give the kids an early supper and send them to play in their bedrooms so you can be on your own.Dedicating this time and making it part of your meal planning will instantly put some romance back into your le.SWIMMING, PE, football, hockey . . . the list of kits needed throughout the week can seem endless.Take  minutes and ask the whole family to look at what unorms they need for the week ahead.Consider picking up some cheap drawstring bags from a pound shop so each kit can have its own bag.Then get everyone to put the bags they need in the car on a Sunday night, so only one evening is spent organising.At the end of the week, you can take out all of the bags and wash everything together. Afterwards, get everyone to refill their bags so the kits don’t disappear upstairs.Not enough time to do some exercise yourself  Use the time when you are waiting for kids to finish clubs to meet a friend at the club and go for a run and a chat.TRYING to give the family a balanced diet on a budget and without spending hours every night cooking and washing up is tricky.But by “batching”, these problems disappear.Write a plan for the week. Look at which nights you are busy or home late and which nights you have more time.On the nights you are busy, plan easy meals such as pizza and pesto pasta. On quiet nights, make a spag bol or a curry and double the amount. Freeze the extra portion so you can use it on a busy night the following week.It will only take an additional five minutes on the night of cooking, yet gives you a whole night off the next week.If you want to be super-organised, spend one hour on a Sunday cooking a few meals and making some healthy lunches for the week ahead.Did you know you can freeze sandwiches IT is straightforward to batch chores such as laundry, vacuuming and cleaning.Dedicate a particular time in the week to do each, so you don’t need to think about it for the rest of the week.If you put on a clothes wash every day, get into a routine of when that will be. For example, I do a wash after dinner and hang it up before bed. That way it is easy to get a good rotation going and I don’t end up with piles of dirty washing.Start allocating some of the work to the rest of the family.

No U-turn, no change.”He said this evening that it became clear to him that more needed to be done over the weekend.Mr Williamson also said he would rip up the cap on university places - and urged them to take as many as possible.He added: They wont be fined and were removing those caps on every single university in the United Kingdom, so that they have the ability to expand the number of places, welcoming more students into those universities, as many as possible.It came after:Roger Taylor, Chair of the exams regulator Ofqual said in a grovelling apology: The pandemic has created circumstances no one could have ever imagined or wished for. We want to now take steps to remove as much stress and uncertainty for young people as possible - and to free up heads and teachers to work towards the important task of getting all schools open in two weeks.After reflection, we have decided that the best way to do this is to award grades on the basis of what teachers submitted. The switch to centre assessment grades will apply to both AS and A levels and to the GCSE results which students will receive later this week.He admitted the change in the system had caused real anguish and damaged public confidence.And the burden had been placed on teachers - who needed to get ready for the start of the new term rather than worry about sending off thousands of appeals.He stressed: For all of that, we are extremely sorry.We have therefore decided that students be awarded their centre assessment for this summer - that is, the grade their school or college estimated was the grade they would most likely have achieved in their exam - or the moderated grade, whichever is higher.A-level student Nina Bunting Mitcham, from Peterborough said at the news: I am so happy for my future, my peers in my college, everybody  affected.Everyone has been heard, finally. The fact I was given a prediction of ABB means I will have those grades and be able to become a vet.I couldnt be happier, I really couldnt.She had got CDD before todays news.Of the chaos around the u-turn she said of the Government: They have really embarrassed themselves, but they have been able to turn it around, to show they do have a heart.They do have some realisation of what they have done, and they have listened for once.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted as soon as the move was confirmed:The Government has had months to sort out exams and has now been forced into a screeching U-turn after days of confusion.This is a victory for the thousands of young people who have powerfully made their voices heard this past week.However, the Tories handling of this situation has been a complete fiasco.Incompetence has become this Governments watchword, whether that is on schools, testing or care homes.Boris Johnsons failure to lead is holding Britain back.Its not clear yet exactly what will happen now with university and apprenticeship applications.Mr Williamsons decision to rip up the cap means many more thousands can go to university -the place wants to offer them one.But many may not be able to get a place, and may be askedthey can defer for a year.Admissions service UCAS said they were working with universities, colleges and schools to support students to understand their options.They said universities would get the teacher grades and could make their own decisions - giving hope to thousands who may have given up hope on their preferred place.They added: “For those students who were not placed with their firmchoice university, our advice is that you don’t need to make your decision immediately. Speak with your parents, s and teachers and then your first conversation will need to be to your firmchoice university.Once your university has your ‘Centre Assessed Grades ’ via exam bodies they can make a decision as to whether there is a place at your preferred choice.“We will be issuing new advice for students and schools and this will be sent directly to students as soon as they are able to take a decision.“UCAS is working with Universities UK and the education sector and whilst the decision is with the inidual university, we will do everything we can to support students to use their CAGs to secure the best possible outcome.”University College London has said they will accept all pupils given an offer, but are still working out how this will apply to courses such as medicine - which had a cap on numbers based on practical constraints.The London university said: UCL’s priority is to be as fair as possible to all applicants, recognising that they have worked hard during unprecedented circumstances and deserve their first choice university.We are delighted to accept all students who meet the terms of their original offer on all programmes that do not have an externally-determined cap .For those students who have met our offer to study medicine based on teacher-assessed grades but do not yet have a place confirmed, we are working with the relevant agencies about places this year and we will guarantee a deferred place for next year.Opposition MPs said the change came too little too late.Wera Hobhouse tweeted: While this u-turn is welcome, it comes too late for many students who have missed out on course places. The Government has shattered young peoples hopes and plans. @GavinWilliamson and @BorisJohnson - how will you make this right Some universities have said they will take kids predicted grades regardless of the changes anyway.But others are sticking with the computer marks and have said they are already full up.Its not clear whether students who have a spot at their second place can refuse it, and get their first choice place again.Mary Curnock Cook, formerly UCAS chief executive, told the BBC kids could have to take gap years because there simply isnt enough places at universities now.She said today: There are literally tens of thousands of students who decisions have already been made about who they accept and dont accept.This change will mean that universities have to rethink completely.I think we must expect from the Government very soon that the cap on university students should be lted. Many have filled their places rightly and now they are being asked to take in potentially tens of thousands of people moved back to their centre assessed grades.There will be some courses that are just physically full and may have to offer deferrals.Tory MPs are set to have meetings with ministers to explain the sweeping changes.Churchills grandson and former Tory MP Sir Nicolas Soames branded Mr Williamson a complete inadequate.And Tory George Freeman MP tweeted at todays news: This #ExamResults shambles has been hugely damaging to trust in the @educationgovuk @DowningStreet:When it was obvious.Defence minister Johnny Mercer and Paymaster General Penny Mordaunt were two serving members of the Government to speak out ahead of the massive u-turn.Dozens of backbenchers and former ministers soon joined in too, forcing the Government to act.Students have been left furious and devastated after algorithms marked their grades down - as they were unable to take exams due to the coronavirus crisis.The PM has confidence in the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, and the head of exams regulator Ofqual despite the chaos.Boris Johnson broke off his Scottish holiday this morning to hold a call with the Education Secretary and other senior officials to discuss the huge change in policy.Tory MPs - including current serving ministers - rounded on the Government for the shambles and demanded they change course.Several Tories were rounding on the Education Secretary last week - amid speculation he could lose his job over the fiasco.After the u-turn he was   with Ladbrokes to be the next Cabinet minister to leave their post.Jessica OReilly of Ladbrokes said: Given the backlash to exam grades its perhaps not too much of a surprise that Williamson is the clear favourite now in a hotly contested market.And a YouGov poll this evening said  per cent of the public said he should quit.He said this afternoon when askedhe would consider quitting that he went to a comprehensive and is determined to fix this.Tory MP George Freeman hinted his job might be on the line.He told Times Radio: Ultimately, the Prime Minister is in charge. And I think he will want to take firm control of this and get a grip and show that his government is taking the le chances of a generation of children seriously... Im told the Prime Ministers you know, planning to reshuffle in the autumn, and I dare say he wants to take everything into account.Labour big beast and ex Education Secretary Alan Johnson told The Sun that Mr Williamson should be sacked.He said: “This job was totally beyond his capabilities. He should go. They may try to blame it all on Ofqual, but this was Gavin Williamson’s mess and he has to take the bullet.”Under-fire exams boss Sally Collier was today blasted for being “invisible” and more secretive than the KGB during the A Levels fiasco.The Ofqual boss - a lelong bureaucrat who earns a whopping £, a year – has not been seen or heard from throughout the fiasco.Fuming politicians and teachers said she must “show her face” and apologise to pupils let down by the disaster.They called for her to be put on her final warning and sackeda way out of the mess is not found.Tory MP Robert Halfon, chairman of the education select committee, told The Sun: “Ofqual have been more secretive than the KGB.“They have behaved like secretive cardinals at the Vatican choosing a Pope rather than like officials developing a transparent grading system.“There is going to need to be fundamental changes at Ofqual when this is all over.”Former Ofsted boss Sir Michael Wilshaw branded the chaos a terrible farce and slammed invisible bosses at Ofqual.Steve Chalke, boss of the academy school chain Oasis, told The Sun that Ms Collier in in the last chance saloon.He said: “She should own up and apologise to every child for the emotional trauma and apologise to students and teachers.“This mess is an insult to teachers and pupils.“They had six months to get ready for this.”Askedshe should quit over the fiasco, he said: “I believe in forgiveness, but she needs to step up and explain herself.

Families on breaks in traditionally popular hotspots such as France, Spain and Portugal must quarantine for two weeks when they get back after the destinations were removed from the UKaposs travel corridor list to curb the spread of Covid-. Facing a fortnight of Government-ordered self-isolation, millions of cautious Brits desperate for a getaway have opted for a UK break instead – sparking a spike in staycations. Downing Street refused to deny tourists ing from Croatia and Greece could soon face quarantine measures after an increase in coronavirus cases in the countries. A No  spokesman said the Government continue to keep these rules under review and protecting public health remains its priority. Travel expert Paul Charles, of the PC Agency, suggested the Government should adopt an Icelandic airport testing scheme, subsidising the cost so passengers pay £. Passengers heading to Iceland have the option of booking a swab test on arrival instead of going into quarantine for  days. They must self-isolate for five days before taking a second test, which is free, at a medical centre. If both come back negative, they can carry on as normal. Total quarantine could be less than seven days. “We have to bring this system to the UK as soon as possible,” Mr Charles told the Daily Mail. “We cannot go on with this -day quarantine system, which is unworkable and causing anxiety among consumers who are losing money. “Adopting this Iceland system here would be a game-changer. “It is far better than the damage and scarring being done to the economy by quarantine measures.”  Airlines UK policy and public affairs director Rob Griggs told the Mirror: “The UK urgently needs a testing regime as an alternative to quarantine, as part of the new normal for aviation as we live with the virus. “Countries like Germany have already introduced a free, one test system for arrivals where, once you’ve had a negative result, you can leave isolation. “This is critical not just for opening up hugely important markets like the United States, but also for travel closer to home. “We’re at real risk of falling behind on testing and Government needs to get a move on.” Would you pay £ for a Covid- test at the airport  Tell us in the comments below  Heathrow Airport could offer a £, -second Covid- test to passengers arriving from virus hotspots. Passengers would be checked inside Terminal  and the results would take up to seven hours to process. They would then take a follow-up test at home five to eight days later. The scheme would be ready to launch within two weeks of the Government saying those tested and whose results are negative could be released from quarantine early.  Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said: “Testing will not only avoid the “quarantine roulette” that so many passengers faced in Spain and France, it will also open up flights to key trading partners such as the US, Canada and Singapore. “The Government’s own research shows that a double test has a high level of accuracy in screening for Covid. “This facility is an oven-ready opportunity to see how Britain can safely reopen for business, as other countries are doing.” ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,loginRadiusAPIKey:d-da-d--ccee,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,loginRadius:true,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,enableAboutTopics:true,GDPRConsentEnabled:,viafouraComments:true,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,LoginRadiusDomain:https:reachplc.hub.loginradius,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true\" How it works in Iceland Icelandaposs airport testing strategy is seen as a model for how travellers can avoid two weeksapos quarantine when they arrive on foreign soil.

Blundering Gavin Williamson last night scrapped all , downgraded A-level results in England and let students use their teachersapos predicted grades instead. But many universities had already rejected students who had an offer and taken other applicants through Clearing instead. According to The Times, , pupils missed out on their first choices last week and have already signed up to other universities. Another , were planning to appeal. The Education Secretary - who marked the moment by posing in his office with a whip - last night lted the cap on the number of students that can go to each university. Yet uni chiefs warned that wasnapost enough to solve capacity problems in accommodation and lecture halls - especially in the age of social distancing.What do you think of how grades have been decided and this change  Join the conversation in our comments below oryouaposre affected, email your story to webnews@mirror.Questioned by the Mirror last night, Mr Williamson failed to guarantee any new funding for stricken unis to boost space. Instead he told us: “We’re working with universities on capacity. We expect universities to honour their pledges. “We’re also setting up a task force with the university sector to work with them, to get through some of the issues and challenges that they’re facing.” Mr Williamson also refused to guarantee that every student will get the uni place that was offered to them - even where theyaposve now got the right grades. Passing the buck to unis, he said: “We’re already working very closely with the university sector to make sure that we do everything we can do to build as much capacity in there. “We expect universities to be flexible, we expect them to go above and beyond, to honour those commitments. There was fury after the exam regulator’s algorithm downgraded % of teachers’ predictions for A-level results – with pupils in poorer areas the worst affected.  Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has tried to sht the blame on to regulator Ofqual - claiming he only realised there were problems on Saturday. That is despite the fact he was being warned about the problems for months, and saw very similar problems play out in Scotland a week earlier. Ministers were finally forced into another screeching U-turn last night to quell fury over the debacle. The Tories caved in to demands to use teachers’ predictions for A-level, AS-level and GCSE results, instead of the bungled computer formula. A solution for BTecs is still being worked out, with thousands of those students still in limbo.The Cabinet minister apologised for the distress caused by the policy - which was meant to prevent aposgrade inflationapos for pupils who could not sit exams because of coronavirus.But questions remain unanswered for universities. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, called for urgent clarication from the Government on a number of crucial issues. He said the change at this late stage will cause challenges for capacity and staffing as he called on ministers to step up and support universities. Paul Whiteman, of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “The big question remains as to why this decision has taken so long, as it may already be too late for some students who have missed out on their first choice of university and course.” University and College Union chief Jo Grady said: “The political incompetence is unforgivable and there are still many questions to be answered.” Boris Johnson has refused to cut short his holiday in Scotland to deal with the crisis - and Mr Williamson has refused to resign. Writing for the Mirror, Keir Starmer said the Tories are guilty of a string of failings during the pandemic.He said: “At a time of national emergency, this is no way to run a country.” The U-turn came after days of pressure and protests including students outside Mr Williamson’s Staffordshire constituency office on Monday. Students  slammed the Government for giving them days of stress before U-turning on grades. Thomas Jukes, , from Great Barr in Birmingham, wants to study medicine at the University of Birmingham and questioned why the “rubbish algorithm” was used in the first place. He said: “I’m much more pleased now I have got my centre-assessed grades. It’s just dependent now on whether my places have been held.” Hatice Dogus, , of Warrington, Cheshire, had been predicted grades of sevens, sixes and fives in her GCSEs and had been offered a place at sixth form based on those predictions.  She said: “Teachers have known me for five years and have seen all the hard work I have put in... whereas the computer would have judged me based on my mock exams and my postcode. I needed the grades I was predicted.” Reagan McNamara, , of Newton-Le-Willows, Merseyside, said: “If they were going off the algorithm I would have failed all of my results, there is no doubt in my mind after seeing the mess the Government made of A-level results.  “I feel a lot better now because my place in college is safe.” Nina Bunting-Mitcham, , who told schools minister Nick Gibb “you’ve ruined my le” after being given three D grades in the A-level results fiasco, is still unsure whether she will be offered the course she wanted. But Nina, of Thorney, Cambs, now has teacher-assessed grades of ABB and said: “I’ve gone from almost wanting to just stop living any more to feeling absolutely ecstatic.”  How grading system will workWhere teachers’ predictions for marks are better thanthe algorithm, pupils will be switched to the higher grade. If the computer system gives them a better mark than their schools believed they would achieve, the higher grade willbe retained by students.This effectively gives pupils a “double lock” on A-levels, AS levels and GCSEs. No appeals are needed. Grades will be automatically hiked.  This spares the Government another row with unions, with teachers able to concentrate on preparing schools to start the new academic year next month. That aspect was specically highlighted by Ofqual in its explanation for the switch. Students unhappy with the marks predicted by teachers can appeal their “centre assessment grades”. The criteria are yet to be released. Gavin Williamson said this could happenpupils suspect teacher “bias or discrimination”. Toriesapos biggest U-turn gaffes The Tories have repeatedly U-turned during the Covid- pandemic.

Teachersapos predictions for A-level, AS-level and GCSE results will now be used instead of a bungled computer algorithm which left % of teenagers with downgraded marks. It came after calls for a U-turn from top Tories, Labour MPs and even advisors to the exam regulator Ofqual. But as the dust settles on the announcement, itaposs too late for some -year-olds to go to the university of their choice. Beleaguered Education Secretary Gavin Williamson failed to guarantee there will be enough capacity for all of them. He refused to resign but apologised to children, saying: It is clear that the process of allocating grades has resulted in more signicant inconsistencies than can be resolved through an appeals process. We now believe it is better to offer young people and parents certainty by moving to teacher assessed grades for both A and AS level and GCSE results. I am sorry for the distress this has caused young people and their parents but hope this announcement will now provide the certainty and reassurance they deserve. But Boris Johnson refused to cut short his holiday in Scotland to deal with the crisis.  Labour leader Keir Starmer said: The Tories’ handling of this situation has been a complete fiasco. Incompetence has become this Government’s watchword, whether that is on schools, testing or care homes. Boris Johnson ’s failure to lead is holding Britain back. He added: The Government has had months to sort out exams and has now been forced into a screeching U-turn after days of confusion. This is a victory for the thousands of young people who have powerfully made their voices heard this past week. So how did the row unfold and what happens nowyouaposre a GCSE or A-level student  Hereaposs what you need to know. What do you think of how grades have been decided  Join the conversation in our comments below oryouaposre affected, email your story to webnews@mirror. What caused all this  Coronavirus forced schools to shut and meant GCSE and A-level exams were cancelled this summer. But students still need results to leave school with - which have been worked out without those exams. How were A-level and GCSE grades decided   Studentsapos grades in England are based on predicted grades, submitted by their teachers. These are called aposCentre Assessment Gradesapos . But those CAGs were moderated by exam boards first, before they got turned into a final grade. This standardisation was supposed to make sure the same standard is applied for all students, whichever school, college or part of the country they come from. What went wrong   % of all A-level grades in England were downgraded from the CAGs - including , by two or more grades - to standardise results and stop them inflating. Official figures show students in the poorest areas were marked down by .% while those in the richest were marked down by .%. That meant tens of thousands of students lost out on university offers. Some launched legal action. What  went wrong   The government announced pupils could appeal using their mock exam results instead. This was called a triple lock - they could use the standardised result, a mock, or a resit, whichever was highest. But this descended into farce as a whole weekend passed with no system for this in place. Ofqual, the exams regulator, issued guidance on Saturday but it was withdrawn after it went against the triple lock. What is todayaposs change  The government has now announced all GCSE, AS and A-level results in England will be based on the teachersapos original predicted grades . Or,youaposre in the small minority of students whose revised grade was higher than your predicted grade , you can keep the higher, revised grade. In other words, every single downgrade that was applied last week - around , of them - has officially been scrapped. Similar announcements with dferent details have already been made for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Essentially, the standardised grading system is now dead. Kaput. Zip. Gone. What about BTechs  Btechs are not included in todayaposs announcement for England. Gavin Williamson said he hoped the pledge will be extended to cover BTechs but it was not ready yet. He said: We very much want to include them on that. “We want to ensure there’s a maximum amount of fairness for youngsters right across the board. “There’s quite a bit of dference because there’s very little disparity in terms of the assessment of grades, of those who took BTechs and other vocational and technical qualications. “But we want to see parity right across the board in terms of how this is approached.” What happens now for students  Students who were preparing a dficult appeal will no longer need to lodge it, as they finally have certainty about what their grade will be. But todayaposs announcement raises as many questions for A-level and GCSE students as it answers. Especially those trying to get into universities - which may not have enough room. They have already rejected many applicants or awarded places to others through Clearing. Will GCSE results still come on Thursday  Yes. The government has said, now that this change is in effect, GCSE results will still be handed out on time this Thursday in England. Now my A-level results have changed, will I still be able to go to my chosen university this year  Itaposs more likely.But itaposs not guaranteed. Now that all students can stick with predicted grades, thousands more cango to their university of choice. But that university might have already rejected that student and offered a place to someone  through Clearing. Gavin Williamson said he would remove the cap on the number of students universities could take, but that doesnapost solve all the problems.The Education Secretary failed to guarantee every pupil will get the uni place they were offered - eventhey now have the right grades.  Askedhe could give that guarantee, Mr Williamson said: “We’re already working very closely with the university sector to make sure that we do everything we can do to build as much capacity in there. “We expect universities to be flexible, we expect them to go above and beyond, to honour those commitments. “But we also recognise, that’s why today we’ve lted student number caps in order for universities to be able to expand and put extra capacity into the system.” Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: Todayaposs policy change will mean that more students will have the grades that match the offer of their first choice university. This will cause challenges at this late stage in the admissions process - capacity, staffing, placements and facilities - particularly with the social distance measures in place. We are seeking urgent clarication and advice from Government on a number of crucial issues.  John Craven, Chief Executive of upReach, said: It is not yet clear that all will be able to honour their offers given capacity constraints - eventhe student numbers cap at each university is indeed lted. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “It may already be too late for some A-level students who have already missed out on their first choice of university and course. David Hughes, Chief Executive of the Association of Colleges, said: It is vital that information is provided speedily on how this decision will impact on higher education institutions, students wishing to apply through clearing and those who may have been rejected on their original grades. When will I formally get my new grades  Mr Williamson could not guarantee when formal exam certicates with the updated grades will arrive. But they will come “as swtly as possible”, either in paper or electronic form. GCSE students will not receive their certicates immediately when they pick up results on Thursday. Can I still take re-sitsI want to   The apostriple lockapos promised to students last week included taking re-sits in October to get a higher grade. This was not a new thing and people have been able to take resits in the past. That suggests that yes,your centre assessed grades were poor, you can take a re-sit. The deadline for entry is September . Weaposve asked the Department for Education and Ofqual what the process will be, and plan to update this story when we have more information. Can I still appeal with mock resultsI want to  Mock results will no longer be used in appeals after the government U-turn, Gavin Williamson suggested. He told reporters: “Mock exams won’t form the basis of the appeal process. “We believe obviously we’re going to see a large number of youngsters get a much higher grade than they previously anticipated. “And obviously we’ll have an appeals process that reflects those changed circumstances. “There will understandably be an appeals process, but mocks won’t be forming a key element of that.” Will I be able to appeal against my teacher-predicted grades  Students will be able to appeal their “centre assessment grades”- but the criteria haven’t yet been released. Gavin Williamson said this would be able to happenstudents felt teachers had shown “bias or discrimination” towards them. What happens now for government  Pressure is mounting on Boris Johnson to break off his holiday to deal with the fallout - and for bungling Gavin Williamson to quit. The Education Secretary is   with Ladbrokes to be the next Cabinet minister to leave their post. Meanwhile the fallout of this weekaposs fiasco will be far-reaching and last long beyond today. Getting rid of one problem - crushed grades - has of course created a new problem of grade inflation, which is why the government didnapost want to U-turn in the first place. That could have implications for those taking exams next summer. David Laws, Executive Chairman of the Education Policy Institute , said: The government should immediately establish an independent review of how this yearaposs results were handled, so that we can learn the lessons for the future and not repeat the many errors that have occurred this year. It should also consider the options for exams in , given next yearaposs candidates will have already been affected by the Covid- pandemic and there remains a chance of further lockdowns.

Now she believes it could have saved her le.At just  years old, she was young, fit and – she believed – in perfect health when she collapsed at her home in Essex in May. “I’ve always been into exercise as a way to keep fit and in shape,” says Loren, who worked as a teaching assistant before her travels. ”I was cooling down after doing my usual routine when I felt a sudden pain in my neck. It was very odd – like a big click inside my body. “My first thought was that I’d pulled a muscle, so I went to sit down. But a couple of minutes later, my boyfriend said I was looking a bit odd and passed me a glass of water. “Next thing, I collapsed. I was unconscious for  minutes – and when I started to come round, I couldn’t see.” What Loren thought was a muscle strain was in fact a stroke in the basilar artery of her brain – one of the most potentially devastating types of stroke, fatal in as many as % of cases. For those who survive, these strokes can leave patients with severe disabilities, including head-to-toe paralysis or locked-in syndrome. Yet miraculously, thanks to prompt and expert treatment, Loren is one of the lucky few who escape completely unscathed. Now she believes she’s alive and well because the coronavirus outbreak forced her to curtail her travels.  She was in Thailand, half-way through a two-year trip around the world with her boyfriend Harry Rodell, also , when the pandemic struck, forcing the couple toto the UK. They went into lockdown with Loren’s family in Chadwell St Mary, Essex and were there when Loren collapsed on May . “The paramedics told me that I’d probably had a stroke,” she says. “I thought that sounded pretty crazy, given my age and good health. I thought strokes were something that only happened to old people.”  While most strokes do occur in people aged over , the Stroke Association points out that they can happen at any age, even in babies. Loren was rushed to her nearest hospital in Basildon, where she was treated with clot-busting drugs, then transferred to Queen’s Hospital, Romford, where she underwent a throm-bectomy. The procedure has to be carried out within hours of the stroke and involves inserting a small mesh hook into an artery in the groin, moving it up to the brain and pulling out the blood clot. It only works in a small proportion of stroke cases, but can have a big impact on reducing disability. As a fairly new “game-changing” procedure, it is currently not widely available. Had Loren not been in the UK when she had her stroke, it’s unlikely she would have been able to have the treatment. “The date I had my stroke, I should have been in Cambodia,” says Loren. “There, I wouldn’t have had speedy access to the amazing medical care that we tend to take for granted in this country.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus updates lockdown parts north","story":"NewsCoronavirus UPDATES: Study finds Covid- could cause diabetes in childrenScientists say the coronavirus spike protein - also known as S-protein - could attack and destroy insulin making cells in the pancreas, just like diabetesShareByNeil MurphyUpdated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video coronavirus-numbers-uk-deaths--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Husband and we Chloe-Anne Davey, , and Adam Davey, , from Ilkeston, had booked a £, holiday for them and their three children, eight, six, and four. They were set to spend two weeks at Bideford Bay Holiday Park in Devon, which is a Parkdean resort. They say they had to buy their own cleaning products - and left the resort a day early - due to the aposhorribleapos condition of the caravan. Mouldy mattresses, badly kept showers and a broken fridge greeted the family on August . Full-time mum Mrs Davey told Nottinghamshire Live: This holiday was really important to us as a family due to the fact we had a lot going on. We lost a baby last September and we have both suffered with depression. The holiday was a time to spend as a family and was super special for us. The past year has been heartbreaking.  But the family said the problems began as soon as they arrived at the door of their static caravan. When we first arrived, [there was a] strong smell of mould. There was also general dampness. The shower was mouldy and the fridge was broken. My four-year-old is asthmatic and was sleeping on the sofa bed. It was full of black mould. It was vile.  She said they immediately complained and were told it was because the caravan was under trees. An upgrade was agreed but they had to wait a week before moving into it as there was no availability until then. Mrs Davey added: We do not think the cleaning measures were taken to a professional standard, let alone a Covid standard. During a pandemic, the hygiene should be topnotch.  They moved into the second caravan only to find other problems, including no frying pans, bins for their rubbish and aposthick black grimeapos on the doors and shower. Despite making complaints, and leaving a day early due to the alleged state of the caravan, they still have not received an apology from the company. It has ruined our holiday, said Mrs Davey.

Regarding Covid-, it’s worth ­remembering because any contact with mother nature, even through a window, is good for our wellbeing. If you can add in some mindfulnessby stopping to listen to birdsong, examining the petals of a flower or noticing the dappled sunlight on grass, the benefits are even greater. Perhaps surprisingly, researchers found that it’s the people who usually feel little connection to nature who stand to benefit the most. I refer you to the University of Derby’s five-year review of the Wildle Trusts’  Days Wild challenge, where people commit to exploring nature every day for  days. A survey of , people showed that taking part in the challenge boosted their health by an average of %.  Professor Miles Richardson, of the University of Derby, said the evaluation “shows the positive power of simple engagement with nature”. He added: “We were thrilled to see that the ­signicant increases in people’s health and happiness were still felt even two months after the  Days Wild ­challenge was over. “The Wildle Trusts have shown the importance of doing simple things to enjoy everyday nature and that it can bring considerable benefits. “What really stood out was how the people who didn’t feel a connection with nature at the outset were the ones who benefitted most from taking part in  Days Wild.” "},{"url":null,"title":"north korean asylum seeker told","story":"NewsNorth Korean asylum seeker told youre not from this country in row over binsMyungseo was filmed in a row with a neighbour in Croydon, south London about where to put the bins outside her homeShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  AUG NewsThe asylum seeker is told youre not from this country by her neighbour in the row \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The story goes that Brad Pitt’s parents, Jane and William, have allegedly not seen their grandchildren since , because of a rt with their mother Angelina Jolie. For my kids, a spell that long away from such influential figures in their lives would be unacceptable. When my better half and I next take a few days off, we will have no compunction about trusting our little ones with their grandparents. The kids will demand it and rightly so. New research showing half of all mothers and fathers have fallen out with their own parents over the grandkids is symptomatic of the breakdown in our society. You only have to look at some of the areas over which they are fighting – discipline, manners, eating habits and screen time. It spooks me to consider just how old I sound saying this, but take a ride on a bus sometime – particularly before or after school – and observe the behaviour of some of today’s youngsters, particularly towards the older generation.  Listen to the language, observe the lack of respect. Then compare it to the way you treated your elders growing up. Consider how many of those kids would benefit from the traditional values on which we were raised. Yes, of course we want to be progressive in the way we bring up our kids. Yetwe are honest we’d all admit to bones of contention with our parents over which they were ultimately proven right. Nor would they approve of the way that iPads and iPhones are used as virtual babysitters now. Studies have shown, too, that extended periods of time with grandparents increases a child’s emotional intelligence and positively affects the way that they relate to their elders. It extends their vocabulary with grandparents taking the time to play and read books while parents are busy working. Time with the elders leaves a child more likely to understand their family history with grandparents able to provide context and perspective. Our youngsters have also learned skill-sets such as crafting, baking and basic DIY.

Scobie claims that Meghan kept trying to book in a day to do the trial run, but struggled to pin Angela down.“He called his grandmother and said, ‘I don’t know what the hell is going on. But this woman needs to make this work for my future we’”, Scobie said. However, that account has now been strenuously denied by a source close to the Sussexes. A source close to the Duke of Sussex has branded the allegations as completely ridiculous and totally untrue.The source told the: “The Queen is probably the person he respects and values most in the world.” Speaking to True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, Scobie explains that an initial meeting where Meghan picked her tiara was actually a huge success. He said: The tiara selection went wonderfully. The Queen was very happy, Meghan was very happy. In fact Meghanaposs words when that story came out were aposhow sad, I love my tiaraapos.  The drama took place afterwards, when Meghan wanted to try that tiara on with her hair stylist, because there is a lot of tech that goes into this. They had to do an experiment with that before the wedding day. The hairstylist came in from overseas, there was an appointment at Buckingham Palace, but nobody was there. We can see kind of see now where this aposwhat Meghan wants, Meghan getsapos narrative came from.  He goes on: Harry felt that there were those within the institution that would stop at nothing to at the very least to make Meghan’s le dficult. “Meghan didn’t get to try the tiara on again until a few days before the wedding.” Meghan wore Queen Maryaposs stunning bandeau tiara, which is covered in precious diamonds.

The government was forced to backtrack on its controversial Covid- awards process, announcing that teachersapos predictions would now stand. It came after tens of thousands of students saw their results downgraded by Ofqualaposs heavily-criticised algorithm. But it remains unclear what happens now with university applications, with many teens having missed out on their first choice because of the governmentaposs shambolic handling of results. Alaa Muhammad, who had faced missing out on her dream of studying medicine in Pakistan after being downgraded, said: I am ecstatic, I am so so happy. I was so hopeless a couple of days ago and now I feel like I can finally breathe again.Did you miss out on a place at university because of downgrading  Email us at  webnews@trinitymirror    Ms Muhammad, from south-east England, had seen her grades fall from a predicted ABB to EDD due to the heavily criticised algorithm. The stark drop saw her post an emotional plea on Twitter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. I deserve to know why you have ruined my chance at le. Why I donapost feel like living anymore. Why I feel like all my hard work and money has gone to waste, she wrote in the tweet, which was retweeted more than , times. Ms Muhammad said she had paid more than £, to take resits at a private college after her studies in year  and  were disrupted.  She now hopes she will be able to find a university place after all. Journalist Lucinda Day fumed that a brilliant Sixth Form student she mentored had missed out on university places - which have since been filled. She wrote: The brilliant state school student I mentored over the past year, had her predicted A-level results downgraded from A* A A to A C C and lost her place to study law at Exeterchoice  Edinburgh . Now the govt have u-turned  the university places have gone. Being awarded what she undoubtedly would have achieved anywayis little consolation when you’re still unable to take up the university place you worked so hard for.  The incompetence of this govt impalpable. Sana Ahmed fears she has missed out her dream place studying law at the University of Birmingham. She was offered a conditional place after earning AAC grades in her mocks, although her teacher assessed grades were ABC. She has not had the chance to prove she can do better. Sana, who studied for her A-levels in Halesowen, Birmingham, toldtoday: If they had gone with my mock results rather than an opinion of someone  or an algorithm I would had a much better chance of being accepted.As a result, she said, the next year of her le has been flushed down the loo by others. In a letter to Birmingham University, she wrote: It is evident that I was on course to achieve the grades you required, had I not been cheated of the opportunity to sit the final exams, only one A-Level grade needed to be improved from my mock to have the required AAB. Student Thomas Jukes, who missed out on a place to study medicine at the University of Birmingham due to his A-level results being downgraded, questioned why the rubbish algorithm was used in the first place. Iaposm much more pleased now I have got my centre-assessed grades. Itaposs just dependent now on whether my places have been held, he told the PA news agency. If they managed to turn around in four days and say, aposwell, you can just have your centre-assessed gradesapos, it wouldnapost have been that much hassle in the first place, would it  I think they put a lot of time and effort into this rubbish algorithm, which has been a monumental failure, to just literally give us what the teachers predicted us anyway.  The -year-old, from Great Barr in Birmingham, said that he contacted the university as soon as he found out the news in the hope that his place had been held. I just gave them a call and they said they canapost update us at this time, more information will be on the website soon, that kind of thing, he added.One A-level student posted on Twitter that the hard work and stress she had put in was finally recognised.She wrote: I am OVER THE MOON!!! on results day I wasn’t happy. I didn’t get the results I deserve with  UCAS points I was looking at foundation years resitting. But now I have more than enough UCAS points for uniand all the hard work and stress is recognised.  Yasmin Walker, who said she wasnapost planning to go to uni but had friends who had missed out on their top choices, wrote: Spaces are full  it won’t fix the stress they’ve been put through already. Absolute shambles. Fawad Sajid, , of Kingsbury, north-west London, said the Governmentaposs U-turn was late but it is better late than never. Standing outside the Education Department in central London, he said: For the greater good, this change is definitely a step in the right direction but I still feel there needs to be a process in which students can appeal against their teachersapos . Some students will naturally feel that having that assessment is not fair either. These appeals need to be treated on a case-by-case basis.

Met Office forecaster Alex Deakin said that by Wednesday it is set to get unusually windy for the time of year.

Mr Dewhurst said: England and Wales continue to have sunshine and showers, some of the showers could be heavy with thunder, but overall the showers will probably be less frequent compared to the last few days and not quite as intense. Parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland are likely to record heavier showers. In Scotland, these showers were likely to merge into spells of heavy rain, Mr Dewhurst said. Tuesdayaposs top temperatures - most likely to be in the London area - are set to be around C. England and Wales bore the brunt of the thunderstorms on Monday after flash flooding caused disruption to parts of southern England. Mr Dewhurst described Mondayaposs thunderstorms as heavy and torrential in places, particularly across parts of the Midlands, East Anglia, south west England and parts of Wales. The highest rainfall totals were in quite widespread places and a lot of these totals fell in the space of an hour of two, so they had heavy downbursts in not very long periods of time.

Dundee City Council said it would provide bottled water.Bailey-Lee Robb, Scottish Youth Parliament member for Cowdenbeath, spoke out on the issue after hearing of several schools where access to water for refilling bottles was a problem.Despite insistence from authorities pupils had access to drinking water, he said: “People on the ground are saying ‘no, we have not’.”The former Lochgelly High School pupil said it was vital children and young people were able to top up bottles throughout the day.He said: “They could, like me, have a medical condition. I would go through at least two-and-a-half litres of water a day at school.“Some pupils have PE four times a week and it’s all fine and well taking a ml water bottle butyou have PE first thing in the morning, that’s it gone.“If it’s a hot day pupils will be expected to buy a bottle of water, so the water cooler situation is putting the cost of a school day up.”The Children and Young People’s Commissioner of Scotland, Bruce Adamson, wrote to the Scottish Government urging it to provide clarity to schools to ensure access to water, which he said was a human right.His office also told parents to complain to their head teacheraccess was denied.We#ve written a FAQ about what to dothis is happening to you or a child you know: https:t.co CzaPiHomdash Children and Young People#s Commissioner ScotlandAugust , However, head of education Shelagh McLean said Fe Council had considered how drinking water could be provided safely.She said: “Our risk assessment includes how we’ll make sure there is drinking water throughout the day, for example allocated slots for each class under supervision.“Water coolers are available, as normal, with measures in place, according to the inidual school, to ensure availability, safe use and cleaning.”A Perth and Kinross Council spokesman said all schools in the region had adequate access to drinking water.He said: “We have changed the use of water fountains so that pupils do not drink from them directly but are used only to fill bottles instead.“Some schools have limited the number of fountains to assist with cleaning and hygiene measures, and some schools are operating a staff fill procedure.”A spokesman for Dundee City Council confirmed bottled water would be provided to schools.Angus Council has also been approached for comment.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It#s quite a covered place, mostly teenagers sit there.#We#ve had slats actually removed with saws, we#ve had boards ripped off the clubhouse. It#s happened a few times, but in the last few months there#s been a lot of litter, and there#s been some graphic sexually-related graffiti on the decking.#We#ve had social distancing signage we put up ripped down as well.#Recently we#ve seen a lot of padlocks broken, and padlocks can be expensive to replace, they can be £ or £ for a decent one. We went through four padlocks in three weeks. If anyone wants to use the court, they just need to get in touch.#We#ve had to get the police involved because it#s criminal damage.#We#re just looking for a little bit of support,you know who is doing it, try and stop them doing it,you see anything going on please contact the police.#The courts are now being booked for Ellon Primary School to use them, and we don#t want broken glass lying around.#The committee member added: #We#ve put a lot of effort in to repair the courts, they#re probably in the best condition they have been in years.#Udny tennis courts are closed so people are using the Ellon ones at the moment and the vandalism doesn#t look good from an Ellon perspective.#The facility is owned by Live Le Aberdeenshire # part of Aberdeenshire Council, although volunteers run the booking system.A spokesman for Live Le Aberdeenshire said: #We are aware of ongoing issues in the area around this facility, including at our nearby pavilion.#We have just met with the local Police Scotland crime prevention officer and Aberdeenshire Council#s property security coordinator to look at ways to tackle the issue.#It#s always a shame to hear of any facility which benefits a community being vandalised, so we would also encourage members of the public to be vigilant.#Inspector Andy Scott from Ellon Police Station, said: #We#re aware of ongoing concerns regarding vandalism at the tennis courts at Gordon Park, Ellon.#Inquiries into these incidents are ongoing and we#d ask for anyone with information to contact police on , quoting incident  of  August.#Anyone who would like to book the Ellon tennis courts for use is asked to contact .For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is. I know many people who find it incredibly dficult, not great when in the middle of nowhere miles from home.In a nutshell the key is to carry out all paper and sanitary waste in a sealable bag, to go aMountaineering Scotland has excellent online guidance on how to dispose of your natural waste.I hope, like me, you will wish to continue to enjoy nature and take the time to care for and immerse your senses in this beautul world we live in."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column july 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPeople remarked on the freshness of the air.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each day, even on weekends.\"The routines of the day also give us powerful signals and demands that the body remain alert for certain tasks and events.\"Regular waking and bed times, alongside regular meal times are very important for regulating your body and its s.\"Sleep PressureSleep pressure is the term used to describe the feeling of tiredness we have, due to the activity we undertake through the day.,params: .pushSleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

especially schools, but we were unable to build a wide enough business base to rely on this.ldquoEach year we have tried other avenues including holidays for Trefoil groups, retreats for local churches, private family gatherings and occasional weddings, but overall we could not generate enough routine business to help us improve the finances.ldquoThis was the situation before we were forced to close Netherurd in March due to COVID-, and since then the centre has had no income.A spokesperson for Netherurd House added: ldquoWe want to take this opportunity to say a huge thank you to all

With food storage at a premium, you dont want to let anything go to waste.Wersquove done the legwork to figure out the right ways to store your food so that it tastes best and lasts the longest.Here are the answers to ten common kitchen storage mistakes.. Youre throwing out your lsquoexpiredrsquo foodCertain expiration dates have less to do with safety than they do quality. Credit: Getty   FangXiaNuoItrsquos important to know the dference between food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo date and food that has passed the lsquoUse byrsquo date. You should never eat food that has passed its lsquoUse byrsquo date, but lsquoBest Beforersquo dates often reflect quality control, not safety or nutritional value. In determiningthe food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo is safe to eat read up on Food Standards Agency guidelines, use your eyes and nose, and follow your gut.Smell:If it smells fine and it was stored properly, its likely okay to eat.Sight:Donrsquot let your eyes fool you when it comes to fresh food like produce. Bumps or bruises donrsquot mean something is ruined.Dont can the cans:Canned goods can last for decades. Even a can thats started to rust should still be okay, as long as it isnt bulging and the seal is intact.Check the packaging, use your senses, cook food thoroughly, and donrsquot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. A proper understanding of expirationdates could drastically cut down on food wastemdashnot to mention wasted money out of your pocket.. Youre using plastic wrap to save your leftoversBees Wrap can be used to store anything from biscuits to sandwiches. But not soup... yet.

Surprised . You dont know how to store your cooking oilsSome cooking oils are best stored in the cabinet, while others can be refrigerated. Credit: Getty   Angelina ZinovievaCooking oils sourced from fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds each have dferent storage needs. Exposure to oxygen, light or heat will subject oil to oxidation, eventually turning it rancid. While some cooking oils can be stored at room temperature, others do best when stored in the fridge.Corn and rapeseed oils:These do just fine stored in a cool, dark cabinet, or you can refrigerate themit takes more than a year to get through a bottle.Olive oil:Leaving olive oil out on the counter or a table, especiallythe bottle gets direct sunlight, or storing it on or near a stove are surefire ways to turn it rancid quickly. Place it in the coolest, darkest place in your home or use a smaller glass bottle in the kitchen.Peanut oil:Can be kept for as long as two yearsstored tightly capped and away from heat and light. Keeping peanut oil in the fridge may extend shelf le even further.Coconut oil:Very stable andhas a shelf le of two years or more.Avocado, grapeseed, hazelnut, sesame, truffle, walnut, safflower and sunflower:Delicate oils that are especially prone to rancidity, especiallyexposed to too much light or heat. Refrigerating after opening is recommended. Kept cold, these oils will remain viable for six months or more.. Youre using the wrong containers to store your foodWe tested the best-selling plastic and glass food storage containers on the market to find the best of the lot. We dropped them onto a linoleum floor, froze them, microwaved them, stained them, pried them apart, stacked them back together, and lots more.Best glass container:Pyrexs Cook and Eat Glass Storage Setisa great choice. Food wont leak, and the glass wont shatter. While the BPA-free lids maystain, they will come clean after a run in the dishwasher. Therersquos a vent for microwave reheats and, as long as the contents are defrosted, itrsquos also preheated oven safe.Best plastic container:Rubbermaidrsquos Easy Find Lidscontainers wonrsquot spring a leak unless you shake them violently, and drops arenrsquot a problem unless the container happens to fall on its side or a corner. No plastic container is oven-safe, but the set is marked dishwasher- and microwave-safe and carries a letime warranty. You should avoid freezing this set, as expanding food may pop the lid.. Youre incorrectly storing fruits and veggiesDo you know which vegetables should stay at room temperature, which should be kept inside a salad drawer, and which should never be stored together  Are you sure Do not refrigerate:Potatoes, onions, garlic, winter squash, tomatoes, bananas, peaches, plums, avocados, mangoes, melons, apples, pears, kiwis, and citrus. Exceptions include freezing for smoothies, or refrigerating for brief periods when theyre close to spoiling.Keep separate:Produce that emits high levels of ethylene gas, including ripe bananas, apples, stone fruit , cantaloupe, honeydew melons, mangoes, pears, ripe kiwis, tomatoes, onions, and leeks.Store alone:Ethylene-sensitive produce, including aubergine, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, caullower, cucumber, leafy greens, peas, peppers, squash, sweet potatoes, strawberries, and watermelon.,params: .push. Youre letting your avocados turn brownThere are many ways to store a cut avocado, but only one that will actually keep it from browning and preserve the flavour: Leave the pit in an avocado, and tightly wrap the half in plastic wrap to keep the flavour and texture intact.. Youre letting the food in your fridge accidentally freezeFoods in your fridge shouldnt be freezing. Credit: Getty   IssaurinkoBiting into frozen food thatrsquos merely supposed to be refrigerated isnrsquot just annoying: Freezing can completely alter the taste and texture of your food. And itrsquos probably because yoursquore probably arranging your fridge the wrong way.Check your fridges temperature settings:The ideal temperature range for the interior of your fridge is degC and below.Determine problem areas:According to appliance manufacturer GE, the most common problem areas are the top shelf, the bottom of the fridge , and door shelves.Avoid vents:Most fridges have a cooling vent above the top shelf. This is where most of the cold air comes from, so keeping food away from here may prevent freezing. Adjust your freezer:Turn up your freezer temperature settings, but nothing north of degF, which will facilitate bacterial growth and accelerate food spoilage.Check your ice maker:Make sure that your ice maker is not constantly running. This could make your freezer too cold and subsequently cause your refrigerated foods to freeze.Stock up your fridge:Refrigerators need to be well-stocked to absorb all of the cold air being vented into the cavity. If it is relatively empty, all of the cold air will sink to the bottom of the cavity and freeze your food. A fully stocked fridge will help maintain temperatures and, as a result, use less energy.. Youre not fixing a door that wont shut properlyIf your fridge door wont close, its probably due to an old, dried-out gasket, the rubber seal that runs along its edge. Luckily, the fix is simple: wash the gasket, and apply petroleum jelly to the rubber to revitalize the old rubber.. Youre not regulating your fridges temperatureA full fridge will help keep the temperature consistent. Credit: Getty   Group StudioDid you know your fridge could actually be making you sick  To keep food out of what the Food Saftey Agency calls lsquothe danger zonersquo, it needs to remain below degC. The freezer should be set to -degC to keep freezer burn at bay. If your fridge and freezer are regularly warmer than those temperatures, yoursquore risking faster spoilage. Here are a few things you can do to keep your fridge properly chilled:Invest in a fridge thermometer.To use, place the thermometer in a cup of water. Why  Your refrigerator measures the temperature of the air around your food, but you want to simulate the temperature inside your foods. Check the thermometer after  hours and then, adjust the temperature of each appliance based on the results.Check to make sure the gasket is in good shape, and seals well.If you can open the door with one finger, your seal isnt tight enough. A leaky seal is an energy waster, and may be a risk to your food.Dust your refrigerators cooling coils,theyre visible. You can use a long, skinny brush made for this purpose.Cover your food.For example, leave eggs in their carton, not in the door.Keep a full fridgeto retain the cold, but leave enough room for air to circulate.The product experts at Reviewedhave all your shopping needs covered.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything .

But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Young people across Scotland could be in line for as much as pound free from the Government for starting a new job, thanks to a new benefit.Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:Income-based Jobseekerrsquos AllowanceIncome SupportIncome-related Employment and Support AllowanceUniversal CreditWhat has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

bending under pressure and telling the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday the Scottish Government had got it wrong.Mr Swinney said it was ldquodeeply regrettable we got this wrong and ordered the SQA to amend awards which had been marked down back to the submitted grade provided by teachers and reissue them.Mr Gray said Mr Swinney had spent five days defending the results before changing his position on Tuesday, asking him: ldquoWhy did he defend the results of this moderation for five days  Why did he leave these young people twisting in the wind for a week, hopes and aspirations in shreds Speaking after the decision, Mr Gray said: ldquoGiven the scale of the exam results scandal, it was inevitable that many local students would have been affected. I have certainly had a number of young people and parents contacting me over the last week to express their concerns about their grades being adjusted down by the SQA and the impact it might have on their futures.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos u-turn will bring relief to these worried young people and their families as they will now see their estimated results reinstated.ldquoHowever, the fact remains they should not have had to experience this worry and uncertainty in the first place. The Education Secretary has let them down and should be held accountable for this fiasco.Schools in East Lothian were yesterdaycontacting pupils who had been affected to let them know they would receive new awards.Across the county, , grades were submitted to the SQA for pupils at the end of May across National , Higher and Advanced Higher level by their teachers.In total, , were acceptedwith  adjusted upand ,adjusted down.In terms of pupils who were due to sit the exams, the council said just over  per cent saw at least one grade marked down.Councillor Shamin Akhtar , cabinet spokesperson for education and childrenrsquos services, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted that John Swinney has finally decided to do the right thing for pupils on the exam results fiasco.ldquoYoung people have faced a very tough and stressful time already and this is something they should never have had to go through.ldquoSchool staff worked extremely hard to submit grades for their pupils to the SQA and the adjustments undermined their professional judgement.ldquoThis u-turn is a victory for young people who have led the campaign against the unfair results and should be commended for standing up for their rights.And Councillor Craig Hoy , a member of East Lothianrsquos education committee, said: ldquoI am delighted that grades have been restored to hardworking pupils in East Lothian who faced huge uncertainty over the last week for no good reason.ldquoEveryone can see that John Swinney has presided over a litany of failures, any one of which could have been a resignation issue on its own.ldquoThe SNP defended their appalling grading system to the hilt, even after it became clear that pupils, parents and teachers had no confidence in the system.On Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued an apology to students across the country who had been marked down by the SQA.She said: ldquoOur concern, which was to make sure the grades young people got were as valid as in any other year, perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system and not enough about the inidual pupil.ldquoThat has meant too many students feel they have lost out on grades they should have had, and that that has happened not as a result of anything they have done but a statistical model or algorithm.ldquoDespite our best intentions, I do acknowledge that we did not get this right and I am sorry.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council welcomed the u-turn, adding: ldquoThroughout this process our schools have sought to represent the academic achievements of our young people in a way that provided a fair and accurate reflection of attainment using the guidance and methodology provided by the SQA.ldquoThe announcement by the Education Secretary will be welcomed by young people who saw their results downgraded, and by our teachers and schools who used their professional judgement when providing grade estimates.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskillpledged his support to headteachers in a letter at the end of last week after the original results came out.He said: ldquoI welcome the Scottish Governmentrsquos announcement.ldquoAs I said last week in a letter to East Lothianrsquos headteachers, I believe the people best placed to know about pupils are those overseeing and working alongside them during their academic journeys.ldquoThis decision is the right one, and I want to send my congratulations to all students in East Lothian for the work they have achieved both before and during this pandemic, as well as a huge thanks to the teachers and school support staff who have worked so hard over the last few months."},{"url":null,"title":"betrayal-claim-mcdonalds-musselburgh-recommended-approval","story":"In a letter to the Courier, Fraser McAllister hit out at their ldquoillogical recommendation which,approved by councillors at an online meeting next week, would grant permission for a restaurant to be created in the car park of the Tesco store off Olivebank Road.He claimed that the drive-thru, which would operate  hours a day, seven days a week, would be ldquonext to the most congested roundabout in the county.The former SNP councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale. The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles. McDonaldrsquos believe that the lessons they have learned in making these changes can be used to support a wider drive to reduce obesity.Planners are recommending the plan be approved with a number of conditions, including submission of litter and pest management plans.A council spokesperson declined to comment, saying the planning committee would consider the application next week."},{"url":null,"title":"wavegarden-scotland-surf-resort-takes-step-closer-reality----looks-unreal","story":"Artists drawings of the plans for Wavegarden Scotland show the extent of the project - which is hoped to create  jobs and generate up to poundmillion for the local economy every year.The visitor attraction is planned for the disused Craigpark Quarry near Ratho on the outskirts of Edinburgh.Artist impressions for the food and retail hubsThe project will involve the installation of underwater technology that can create , waves per hour, from slow moving white water for beginners through to powerful barrels up to two metres high for experts.Yesterday, the teams developer confirmed it had been backed by planners to include a food and retail hub, as well as glamping pods for accommodation.Tartan Leisure Ltd, developers of Scotlandrsquos first articial surf park, Wavegarden Scotland, received planning permission today.

Essentially, this means there should be no way of telling yoursquove been there ndash no litter, no signs of fires, no damage to trees or other elements of the environment.This is a good example of wild campingSome very conscientious campers take this further by removing litter left by others, i.e. the site looks better for them having been there. Hats off to these heroes.If it can sometimes be dficult to define what wild camping is, itrsquos easier to say what it isnrsquot.It isnrsquot pitching a tent in a car park, and it certainly isnrsquot turning up with your entire family and friends and a car full of glamping kit and or lager.It may also surprise some people, but responsible wild camping would not include an open fire at least not in certain areas. SOAC states that you should ldquonever light an open fire during prolonged dry periods or in areas such as forests, woods, farmland... So, fires in the woods are in breach of the code, as are fires anywhere during dry periods.If yoursquore desperately in need of a fire, the place to have it is on the beach.Itrsquos also a good idea to bring your own wood. Collecting fuel on-site isnrsquot a good thing, as dead wood is a valuable part of ecosystems. Cutting branches from trees may constitute vandalism and anyway, green wood burns really badly.Perhaps itrsquos also important to think about the ethos behind wild camping.As mentioned, truly wild camping should have an intrinsic respect for, and minimal impact on, the natural environment.At some of our sites, wersquove seen a huge increase in camping in recent years.Many of those involved are reasonably responsible campers, fires aside, that is, leaving little or no litter.However, the cumulative effect of such a high density of campersis to slowly degrade the natural environment.Then, of course, therersquos the issue of where all these people are going to the toilet, but letrsquos not dwell on that.So, perhaps it just needs a little more thought on the part of the campers.Some sites are simply inappropriate ndash Aberlady Bay and Traprain Law, for example, being a nature reserve and scheduled monument respectively.Others may be OK sometimes, but not when busy.Under these circumstances, it may be that prospective campers should think about choosing another venue.Right, rant over normal service will be resumed next month."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-clifftop-castle-tales","story":"I have always wanted to visit it, but never seemed to get the opportunity then suddenly, a day of sunny weather last week combined with some free time made a trip possible.The walk to the castle was stunning, with purple heather-clad braes and a sparkling sea.

And what tales are sewn onto this rocky top!The castle gets its first mention in the early s, but for sure human habitation predates that. In , the English captured it and it remained in English hands for the rest of that century a stone in the shoe of south-east Scotland. It was finally retaken in  by the forces of Patrick Dunbar but later it became a rebuilt stronghold of the Home family.History records that they hosted the young princess Margaret Tudor here in  as she headed north to become Scotlandrsquos queen, with her marriage to James IV and thus change the destiny of both countries.She will have shared the views we had while we ate our picnic, although I suspect her banquet may have been a little more indulgent. Who can say what impressions this wild view gave her of her new homeland.Her granddaughter, Mary Queen of Scots, would visit the castle  years later in , in what for her was a very turbulent time.How I wished the few stones of the castle that still stood could tell a story of these remarkable women, who had to navigate their royal privilege through misogynist contempt.After being abandoned, the castlersquos windswept ruins were the haunt of smugglers and wreckers, who would set a light amongst the old stones, making it look like a welcoming port.But it was the story of Madge Gordon that was foremost in my mind as I sat amongst the ruins of the castle that, according to the tale, she helped liberate from the English.The story is called the lsquoGuid We of Coldinghamrsquo and it is to be found in Wilsonrsquos Tales of the Borders. These were a fantastic collection of stories written by John Mackay Wilson in the early th century. Today, the Wilsonrsquos Tales Project promotes his work, which was prodigious.It is a tale set in the grim times of the Rough Wooing in the s, when English forces were using force and terror to persuade the Scots to agree to the marriage of the young Mary Queen of Scots to Edward Tudor.Madge was a widow with an abiding hatred of the English occupiers, who had killed her husband. Her daughter Janet was in love with a young man called Florence, but Madge would only agree to their marriagethe young man showed his loyalty and mettle by helping her to take Fast Castle, which had been occupied by English forces.This he agreed to do, and raised a force of over a hundred local people. Madge hatched a plan to attack the castle, but both she and Florence kept it secret from Janet. She feared for her loversquos le, and felt strongly that war was pointless for it mattered not who occupied the castle as the poor folk would be oppressed either way.Madge led the attack, entering the castle in the guise of being a seller of local produce, then plunging her husbandrsquos sword into a guard. The ensuing fight was short and brutal. The young Florence fought bravely and the castle was won.After this, Madge proudly agreed that the brave Florence was worthy of her daughterrsquos hand in marriage. Janet, who had heard the commotion of the fight and rushed to the scene, desperately looked for her Florence.When she saw he was alive, she rushed joyfully to him and held him in a tight embrace. He held her likewise, saying her name ldquoJanet.But this was to be his last word spoken, for his hold on her began to weaken and his legs gave way. He had been mortally wounded in the fight. Janet screamed for help and he was carried into a room in the castle, where frantic attempts to revive him were made but he was gone.Janet plunged into inconsolable grief. She blamed her mother, and the unbearable loss sent her to the grave only two years later. Her mother followed the year after, and all three rest in Coldingham kirkyard.ldquoWhat a sad story, my we said after I had finished telling it. ldquoIs it true ldquoMaybe not in the sense you mean, I said, ldquobut it is a story with real truth: how war spawns hatred and loss, and as Janet said, the poor folk lose out whoever rules the castle.On such a sunny day, it was dficult to leave this beautul place, but the kids wanted a swim and the sun was already lowering in the sky.The walk back is a hard slog up the brae, but it gives moments to rest and catch your breath while turning to view the ruins.Here, surrounded by millions of years of geology, with the view of the tumbled remains of a castle in which lives now long forgotten were lived, a whisper is heard in the wind.ldquoWhatever your woes, whatever your joys, yours is a tiny speck in time, so use it wisely and with gratitude.On that day, I think we did just that."},{"url":null,"title":"msp-column-ensuring-river-esk-remains-clean","story":"For too long now, the river has been a point of concern for many of my constituents, and I wanted to start a forum where it would bring together those who are working to clean the river, as well as those from the community with an interest in the river, so that we could all work together to find a resolution.In my view, it is important that we look at the cleanliness of the river as a whole, tackling the issues from the sewage spillages and the coal mine discharge in Midlothian, right down to the poor water quality at Fisherrow.The meeting was productive and I am looking forward to seeing progress on this matter.

It soon ran into problems.Landowners denied access, requiring a detour, putting Aberlady station half a mile from the village. NBR fought any extension past Gullane to avoid competing with their own line from Drem.Such problems delayed opening until April , , when a service of nine trains a day ran between Longniddry, which had three s, and the Haddington branch.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too. Like adding a nice feature wall for a splash of colour or why not try adding a nice gallery wall with lots of family pictures  A great way to add a personal touch to a room. You can even get the family involved to pick out their favourite pictures.Plants are a great way to brighten up a room and fill any unused corners.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit, literally. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:What has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

Another friend just bluntly declares itrsquos my job so get on with it like everyone .I wonrsquot just be going anywhere. Broadcasting on BBC Radio recently I was reminded of how dferent the situation and sentiment is in some of Scotlandrsquos island communities. Understandable when NHS Western Isles are the only health board in Scotland to record zero Covid- deaths to date. Irsquom acutely aware of our safety too as Irsquom sitting by my we Jenny with our two young daughters in the back. Wersquove multiple face masks and a gooey hand gel lake decanted into ious vessels. I spend the first half hour reminding the girls of the Scottish Governmentrsquos snappy FACTS campaign. Snappy, but I still need to look up what the lsquoCrsquo stands for.First up is Loch Melfort Hotel, a real escape out on the wild and wildly beautul west coast of Argyll. The owner is a high heidjin in Visit Scotland so they should get it right. Over a physically distanced coffee with the isles of Luing, Jura and Scarba sparkling behind him Calum Ross explains: ldquoItrsquos a real balance between making sure we take all the essential public health precautions, while at the same time ensuring itrsquos still an enjoyable and rewarding experience for our guests.Reassuringly Loch Melfort do get it right. They have clear signage branded with an image of Dougal, one of the Highland Cows who grazes happily outside, oblivious to the pandemic swirling around. lsquoDougal saysrsquo signs remind us to socially distance and to use the gel dispenser as we enter the lobby. He pops up again in our room helping us to find the hotel directory online.In the restaurant staff wear visors and dispense sanitised plastic menus. I momentarily miss a crisp white linen tablecloth, but this is soon forgotten when my Argyll beef fillet topped with local langoustines sweeps in. The girls and Jenny are tucking in too. I see Dougal outside. He seems to approve. As do our fellow diners. Itrsquos good to be with strangers smiling and laughing rather than just seeing our neighbours clap awkwardly on a Thursday.Next up wersquore off on a cruise ship. The Foreign Office almost stymies us by bringing in a blanket ban on cruise travel just before we sail. Fortunately wee Red Moon is husband and we run and takes just four passengers so our nuclear family is a charter rather than a cruise.Scott and Mary welcome us aboard like old friends, just ones who donrsquot shake hands anymore. Their trim, beautully fitted out marine hotel is equipped with a flotilla of hand gel and they explain theyrsquoll clean our bathroom daily, just not our cabins. They stress the use of gel going ashore and also that we must stay away from Maryrsquos cooking space in the galley.We spend four days puttering around close to shore after deciding to avoid inhabited isles. We ramble around rugged Bernera, where once St Columba preached under a giant yew tree. It doesnrsquot look like anyone has visited since. We also take the tender ashore in an overnight anchorage at Loch arsquo Choire in Morvern. We do stumble upon locals, but they are red deer and soaring golden eagles. Just off Lismore we are graced with a sea eagle and dolphins.Then it happens. On sleepy Balnagowan we presume the islandrsquos owner is not around. We row ashore to avoid disrupting the local seal colony, who are intrigued by our landing party and send scouts over to investigate. I ramble off alone, mindful of protective nesting seabirds and there she is. The lady owner of Balnagowan. I immediately spill into apologetic mode, but she stops me in my tracks with a beaming smile saying how happy she is just to see someone. Lockdown must have been very lonely on Balnagowan.Back on land we gun east for Perthshire and the cosseted world of Gleneagles. But can you achieve world-class five-star luxury in the time of Covid- with safety precautions in and swimming pools and spas out  The answer is a resounding yes. On arrival no one seems to mind the lack of valet parking as they shimmy respectfully through the grand racing green lobby sticking to the left as signs advise. We sanitise ourselves before meeting the receptionist, whose smile beams through her mask and screen. Again these measures reassure rather than concern.The swimming pools may be off bounds, but impressively the spa has managed to re-open, offering limited virus sensitive treatments such as a face down massages. All the restaurants have re-opened. We savour the excellent Indian dishes of the Dormy , the swish new Birnam Brasserie, with its fish and meat grills, and that grand old world dame, the Strathearn.At the Strathearn theyrsquove retained the white linen tablecloths, though they politely inform us we have to look after our own napkins ndash treacherous waters for a serial napkin dropper like myself. Once we settle in we soon forget about their visors and the sommelier is just the ever helpful sommelier and the waiters just supremely friendly waiters.In lieu of swimming we do what governments on both sides of the border have been recommending ndash get outdoors. First up is gundog training, a country pursuit I never experienced growing up on a council house scheme in West Lothian, but which thrills the girls who donrsquot care about having to wear plastic gloves. Then it is on to archery, shooting and falconry as we rattle through a greatest hits of Scottish country sports. Kids are really looked after here, even more so these days as Scott Dunn have just introduced their first ever UK programme of activities this month with Covid-era staycations in mind.When Scotlandrsquos well-heeled travellers realise a foreign holiday this year is a forlorn hope, Gleneagles is ready. But not everyone can splash out on such decadence. Our last stop is just up the road. We swap fluffy robes and marble bathrooms for a converted Leyland horse truck.Camping is all the rage this summer. As the author of Cool Camping: Scotland thatrsquos great to see. If the thought of struggling up your own tent on a windy west coast beach is too much, though, glamping tempts. Alexander House offers a brace of Mongolian style yurts, which are cosy with wood burning stoves and a surprising amount of space, with a separate bathroom with stand alone baths. The decking hosts a gas bbqand a wood fired hot tub. Once we work out how not to cook ourselves itrsquos a joy.The new option at Alexander House is Juniper. This vintage Leyland horse truck has been converted into a surprisingly swish hideaway. Itrsquos like a chic urban Airbnb inside, all fresh smelling wood ling and hipster deacutecor and furnishings. It also boasts a wee kitchen and the luxury of electricity. Outside wersquove got your own wee fenced area so you can bring a dog. And two kids. Ours love the resident brace of Highland cows who are very interested in our stay. Perhaps Dougal has forewarned them.Irsquove not mentioned Covid- for a few paragraphs and thatrsquos telling. We are now Covid-era travelling veterans, just enjoying the glorious outdoors and the scenery. For the record there are gel stations at the yurts and Juniper, the welcoming couple who run it donrsquot shake hands and wersquore assured our accommodations have been scrupulously sanitised. At the end of our stay our bedding is deep cleaned off site.When we eked out of our drive it was with real anxiety after being cooped up staring at pandemic ravaged TV screens. Everywhere we went, though, we have been reassured not only by the set-up, but also by the professionalism and consistency of the staff. The only aberrations were from fellow travellers not well versed in Scotlandrsquos lockdown measures, but thatrsquos similar to the confusion you can encounter in your local supermarket.

The last time we spoke she apologisedwe were catching a whf of venison liver, as a package had leaked on the passenger seat. Her collie was sitting beside her in the front, butthere was any lingering aroma she was the only one to catch it. Our friend is a boon to local butchers, as is Alan. The previous day he had queued behind a woman ordering lambrsquos liver for herself and her dog. When quizzed she revealed that she also gives him ham rolls with salad, although he always leaves the salad.The path we often take on Sundays is a regular circuit, whose interest never wanes. In good weather, the view over the Cheviots is like a Van Gogh, the foreground filled by fields of wheat or stubble, the hills a smudge of dark blue in the distance. Even in torrential rain the canopy of trees that hangs over the track acts as an umbrella. It would be possible to cover these short miles with only a few minutes entirely without shelter. Given recent downpours, though, those minutes make the dference between dry or squelchy boots.The previous Sunday we encountered a Geordie disconsolately smoking by a stile. He had been walking for a couple of hours after waking, in his tent, to find himself in two inches of water. His sleeping bag was soaked.His companion, who had held them back by stopping too often ldquofor a beer and a tar, had already abandoned the expedition. Even though the sun was shining, he seemed on the verge of doing the same. We pointed him towards Jedburgh, beyond which lay his destination of Holy Island, but will never knowhe made it.The path we usually take goes past a couple of farms. The main attraction lately is to catch a glimpse of a foal, which is only a few weeks old. Before we reached the paddock, we caught sight of him between the trees, ginger, spindly-legged and stuck to his motherrsquos side like a barnacle on a keel. A friend saw him one morning shortly after he had been turned into the field, galloping at full speed, legs out front and back.We stood by the gate, watching the older bay foal reclining on the grass, while the mares grazed. Then a renegade sheep made an unexpected appearance. It hirpled towards the horses, one foreleg dangling, but making good speed with its three ing limbs. In a moment, the young bay was up, putting its mother between him and the intruder. The sheep skirted them and went its way, and moments later, with danger passed, both foals were suckling. The little ones stumpy tail whirled asbattery operated.Continuing down the track, we were approached by horses on every side. Around here they are so used to people that they consider every passer-by a friend. Occasionally they have thundered along the field side to say hello.In one pasture, our steps startled them into galloping off, but when we leaned over the fence they cantered back, doubtless hoping for snacks. Like so many horses in summer, one was wearing a mesh hood as protection against flies. Its an idea hill-walkers should consider.Not long after reaching the old drove road, the sound of baying reached us from a farm where hounds are kennelled. It was so frenzied you might have thought a fox was taunting them from beyond the fence. It is always an unnerving noise, a throw-back, perhaps, to the howling of wolves.By the time we reached their farm, they had quietened. Its always a relief. I like dogs, but the prospect of being surrounded by an excited pack is worrying. Ive had more than enough run-ins with Alsatians and nippy sheep dogs to know how scary they can be when chasing you off their land.My sister was once bitten by a dog on a farm in France, and had to be given an anti-rabies injection in her stomach. Impressively stoical when it comes to medical matters, she still shudders at the memory. It was possibly even worse than the day she caught her fingers in the blender.The road past the farm leads to wooded hillside, beyond a lake. This morning two swans faced each other, creating the love heart shape so beloved of hoteliers as they contort hand-towels for your arrival. Three deep grey cygnets swam beside them, with no hint yet of white. Two have disappeared in recent weeks, feared to have fallen foul of foxes.Near the lake is a verge where last month we came across a family of newborn voles. One had been trampled, and its siblings were either in shock or simply too young to realise what had happened. I prodded them with a frond of grass to urge them back into the hedgerow, out of sight of passing predators.On our final mile, we encountered a creature that would have swallowed them like Coco Pops. In the cool green shade of an avenue of beeches, a heavy bird suddenly launched itself onto the air and disappeared deeper into the trees. As we got closer, it moved further again. Each time we were too far away to identy it. I thought buzzard, Alan an owl. The rest of the walk was spent trying to settle the matter, although like so much in the countryside, it will forever remain a mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-unionists-witch-hunt-opposition-just-sake","story":"It will be interesting to see how events unfold where, and in England particularly. There, awarding bodies applied similar processes to moderate estimates submitted by teachers that were \"ridiculously inflated\".

The dference is due to the peculiarities of the two electoral systems, the one guaranteed to produce an overall majority in Westminster on as little as  per cent of the votes, the other designed to prevent an overall majority under any but the most unpredictable circumstances. The result has been shameless opportunism by the Unionist parties in proposing a vote of no confidence in John Swinney, when he did what any education secretary should do in protecting the value of the qualications awarded to candidates, as all candidates suffer when their awards are devalued. Had the SQA awarded a % pass rate based on teachersrsquo inflated estimates, he would have been castigated by these same parties. Tory MSP Jamie Greene even called for the resignation of Fiona Robertson for, effectively, not only following the instructions of her employer, the Education Secretary, but also of protecting the value of SQArsquos qualications as she was bound to do in her contract of employment. This smacks of opposition for oppositionrsquos sake but for Unionists, the Union comes before everything.Larry Cheyne, Bishopbriggs.I FEEL Rebecca McQuillan somewhat misses the point over what the public perceive of both the pandemic, and the reaction to it of their leaders . I suspect most people see Scotland as suffering heavy coronavirus mortality as a consequence of UK ldquolockstep, and that having erged from that would assess us as doing better. Nicola Sturgeon stands up daily to answer questions, and is regarded as trustworthy all over the UK in a way that Boris Johnson is not.You donrsquot require weasel words like ldquosaintly to describe competence. Impartial news and journalism is important. The media that operates in Scotland, not least the BBC, have allowed themselves to be exploited as a conduit for attacks on the governing party in a way that does not happen in England. The public arenrsquot daft they can see this bias in the dferent emphasis placed, for example, on the education ldquoshambles on both sides of the Border. You can see it on any health issue, where the BBC in Scotland immediately escalates every story to a government ministerial responsibility. That never happens in England, in spite of repeated serious health scandals over decades.Why does this matter  It seems that repeated, and context-free, SNP-bad stories have inured many in the public into regarding much of the news as Unionist ldquodisinformation, and increasingly easy to ignore. An interesting project for universities to evaluate. The latest wheeze is to badge every spending commitment to Scotland with a Union flag asScots did not pay taxes. Will it give Scotland a fair per capita share of UK spending, for example, in defence spending and procurement  And the BBC, which will be expected to promote this stunt, will it spend in Scotland the same per capita share of its licence fee, as England GR Weir, Ochiltree.MY support for independence rests on the simple fact that it would allow the people of Scotland to elect the Government of their choice rather than having one chosen by voters south of the border. It has nothing to do with the competence or otherwise of any political parties or inidual politicians but has everything to do with my perception of the competence of the Scottish nation. Against this, your regular anti-independence correspondents, including Dr Gerald Edwards and James Martincan offer nothing better than their view that Nicola Sturgeon may be brilliant but John Swinney is useless. How does that in any way relate to the democratic deficit which underpins the case for independence Willie Maclean, Milngavie.CONGRATULATIONS to your correspondent James Martin, for condensing into one short paragraph the most brilliant piece of doublespeak that Ive ever read in your Letters Pages. He refuses to comment on the suitability of the Education Secretary for the position while at the same time labelling Mr Swinney incapable of holding any government post.Gordon Evans, Burnside.GERALD Edwardsasks the question \"Is Scotland really a democracy any more \" As the no-confidence vote against John Swinney failed because it wasnt backed by the majority of MSPs, then clearly the answer is that Scotland is a democracy. The political make-up of the Scottish Parliament may not meet with Dr Edwardss approval, but he and all of Scotlands voters will be able to have their say next May and we will get the government we elect, unlike the situation at Westminster where we get not only the government England elects, but an unelected second chamber, where the already excessive numbers are due to be swollen still more by a Dame who is currently ensconced in Holyrood as a Tory MSP. Wheres the democracy in that Dr Edwards need have no fear that \"independence will be foisted upon us\". Scotland will regain her independence when Scotlands voters make that choice, and as there has been a \"signicant and material change of circumstance\" since  and as opinion polls increasingly indicate that voters want to make that choice, there should be no obstacles put in Scotlands way to prevent the choice being made. That would be a real travesty of democracy.Ruth Marr, Stirling.A NEW poll shows that four in  Scots, including a majority of SNP voters, do not want English tourists to be admitted to Scotland . I can only assume that these substantial numbers of people are not themselves involved in the tourist industry, and that they do not have family members, neighbours or friends who are so involved. The tourist industry has been very hard hit by the coronavirus, and consists of far more than BBs and attractions of ious kinds. Shops, pubs, bars, restaurants and taxis, and more, all benefit greatly from tourists.I can only assume that those who would bar from Scotland English people ndash who normally come here in their droves ndash have some kind of atavistic grudge and no concern for their fellow Scots who depend on tourists of all kinds for a livelihood.

But I believe schools should ldquosqueeze the brake pedal before reverting to the way things were in February. We have a golden opportunity to change our rigid education system.I donrsquot propose a complete abandonment of exams, timetables and classrooms, but I believe we have a duty to ask whether we can evolve the education system to better prepare pupils for an unknown future.Last year, our school built the UKrsquos first Innovation School, NuVu. There, pupils collaborate on developing creative solutions for real-world social and environmental problems. This supplementary method of learning challenges the Scottish Government by providing an example of how a new national curriculum could look.In March, the innovation school hatched a spinout, ViseUp, a collaboration between Kelvinside Academy and businesses across Scotland, which used the schoolrsquos D modelling software, D printers and laser cutters to provide PPE for frontline staff.For all that agility, we ndash just like every school ndash were unprepared for a pandemic. We learned valuable lessons and are still working to answer a litany of dficult questions of ourselves, our school and the entire system.Does being taught passively by a teacher in a classroom serve pupils  They are digital natives and wersquove been given a passport into their world.

Often those questions are the gateway to true breakthroughs. How can we make sure pupils continue to feel secure enough to ask those questions in the classroom As businesses across the world debate whether or not toto the office, we will explore how we can adopt elements of blended learning which serve pupils preparing to enter a world moving away from an office-based -, with increased flexibility, and increased personal responsibility.Witnessing the pupils who have thrived during lockdown has been a wake-up call. We must make sure these pupils continue to thrive when school s. Part of this will be continuing to prioritise inidual feedback on a task by task basis, even in the cut and thrust of the classroom.Pupils have been consumed by two stories the pandemic and the social justice movement. We were able to adapt to make space to explore these issues and the level of engagement was inspiring. Can we be agile enough to always put current issues at the heart of the curriculum Finally, we must ask how we can make sure therersquos a quick and easy switch to home learningschools must close again.If educators go back to the way things were, we will fail our pupils. What will allow us to answer these questions is empathy and openness. We must be open to transformation and empathetic to pupils and teachers as we navigate our uncertain future.For all the questions and for all the debate about what pupils have lost, we are certain about what the most valuable skill pupils can have when they leave school, and itrsquos resilience.

I donrsquot think that he has really thought this through, though.Aside from the ridiculous assertion that he will one day be First Minister, has he not realised that continuing to run the line at Scottish football matches would mean that the new leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party would, in fact, be facing the general public This is something that no Conservative leader does any more, that isthey ever did. Running the line at football matches was previously okay for him because he was a complete and utter nonentity unknown completely to the general and footballing public, but it will not be the case now.I now look forward to his public footballing appearances in the former industrial heartlands of Central Scotland decimated by the very people he venerates. However, fair play to himhe does turn out and I look forward to see his appearances at such places as Motherwell, Falkirk and Dundee. Perhaps he will hold public question and answer sessions after the matches.What he will do, though, is have football chairmen up and down the country rubbing their hands in anticipation of adding a few thousand supporters on to their gates every week. When the wider Yes movement and the grass roots football fans realise that he will continue to run the line at Scottish football matches and with thousands deprived of Yes marches to go on, attendance at Douglas Ross football matches could become a new raison drsquoecirctre for lots of Scots he could possibly single-handedly save Scottish football, filling stadiums week in week out.However much as it would be entertaining to see him continue as a football linesman I fear his bosses in London will put a block on the continuation of his refereeing career.

If it is not yet an exodus, it is certainly a trend, and it is in effect across the political spectrum.At next Mayrsquos election, the SNP will lose Aileen Campbell and Gail Ross, one an established Minister and Cabinet Secretary, and the other most likely on track to becoming one.The Tories will lose Ruth Davidson and Adam Tomkins, the first being by some distance the biggest name the party has ever had, and the second a real henrsquos tooth an MSP who combines academic intelligence and political smarts.And Labour will lose Neil Findlay, someone who can break the Holyrood mould by making a speech without having his eyes fixated on a script.These are people of high ability and with good ideas. There are dferent drivers behind their decisions, to be sure, and I will not imprint them here on each inidualrsquos behalf, but the fact remains that whatever their reasons, they are united by one overriding view: this is not worth it. And we should all be deeply worried that they think that.Perhaps last weekrsquos events in Holyrood gave us eyes on the problem. In John Swinney, few would question that we have as an education secretary a real political heavyweight. A man of substance and morals. A good man. He has erred during this time in the role, most notably in buckling before the trade union when he was thwarted in his attempts to empower schools and teachers, and more recently when he failed to foresee the incandescence amongst parents and health professionals at the thought of children not ing to school full time.Butwe are in search of a politician who doesnrsquot make mistakes, wersquoll spend a long time searching. Last week, Mr Swinney faced a vote of no confidence in the Scottish Parliament, with us urged to believe that the very act of him being replaced would suddenly propel us to educational excellence.This was the result of his perfectly sensible proposal to moderate the exam results to replicate as closely as possible the outcome of real exams. It was the least imperfect of a set of imperfect options.We did what, in this country, we just love to do. Labour argued that every student should be awarded their teacher estimate even though it is perfectly clear that employers and universities will forever look upon this cohort as tainted. The Tories agreed even though theyrsquove spent  years arguing against grade inflation. And the Government caved, even though it knew it was allowing optics to override policy.Watching from outside the bubble, Scotland felt very small last week. And it made me think, as I have many times before, who would want to do this  Who would want to be John Swinney  Who would want to be an MSP Irsquove been around politicians all my working le, so please allow me to give you a snapshot of their existence.They work long and hard. Commonly - hours a week, sometimes more, and usually seven days a week. Most of them travel, having to stay away from their families three nights a week. They spend their days in Parliament, their evenings at meetings and s related to work, and their weekends seeing constituents at surgeries or cutting ribbons at community events.We expect this from them, and wersquore angrywe donrsquot get it. If they are not omnipresent, we abuse them. Usually online, where they are commonly subjected to bile , but also sometimes in the street.If they make a mistake, or eventhey donrsquot, we deride them. They are mocked in the press, live and in colour for their parents, partners and children to read.And we demand they do all of this for a salary similar to that available in a middle management role at a local authority.This is not designed to incite a wave of sympathy for Ministers or politicians. Nobody makes them stand, or seek high office. The SNP would have done to a Tory or Labour Minister what they had done to them last week. And they all must shoulder their fair share of blame for the fairly depressing relationship we endure between the three legs of the stool: politicians, media and people.But we should be clear where this ends. It ends with more good politicians leaving. It ends with less talented people, who do not have as many employment options out in the real world, being elected in their place.The solution lies in joint action to make Holyrood a better place to be. That means political change, where adult behaviour replaces pettiness. It means a joint sht in the relationship and understanding between politicians and the media. And it means the public giving politicians some room for manoeuvre, including a signicant rise in their salary.We can keep going the way we arewe wish to. But wersquoll end up with the politicians we deserve.bull Andy Maciver is Director of Message MattersOur columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

We want to now take steps to remove as much stress and uncertainty for young people as possible...\"After reflection, we have decided that the best way to do this is to award grades on the basis of what teachers submitted. The switch to centre assessment grades will apply to both AS and A levels and to the GCSE results which students will receive later this week.\"Mr Taylor said there was \"no easy solution\" to the issue, and said the Education Secretary had asked the body to \"develop a system for awarding calculated grades, which maintained standards and ensured that grades were awarded broadly in line with previous years.\"He said: \"Our goal has always been to protect the trust that the public rightly has in educational qualications.\"But we recognise that while the approach we adopted attempted to achieve these goals we also appreciate that it has also caused real anguish and damaged public confidence.\"Expecting schools to submit appeals where grades were incorrect placed a burden on teachers when they need to be preparing for the new term and has created uncertainty and anxiety for students. For all of that, we are extremely sorry.\"We have therefore decided that students be awarded their centre assessment for this summer - that is, the grade their school or college estimated was the grade they would most likely have achieved in their exam - or the moderated grade, whichever is higher.\"The path forward we now plan to implement will provide urgent clarity. We are already working with the Department for Education, universities and everyone  affected by this issue.\"Mr Williamson said the government \"now believe it is better to offer young people and parents certainty by moving to teacher assessed grades for both A and AS level and GCSE results.\"He explained: \"We worked with Ofqual to construct the fairest possible model, but it is clear that the process of allocating grades has resulted in more signicant inconsistencies than can be resolved through an appeals process.\"I am sorry for the distress this has caused young people and their parents but hope this announcement will now provide the certainty and reassurance they deserve.\"Labour leader Keir Starmer branded the whole scenario \"a complete fiasco\".He said: \"The Government has had months to sort out exams and has now been forced into a screeching U-turn after days of confusion.\"This is a victory for the thousands of young people who have powerfully made their voices heard this past week.\"However, the Toriesrsquo handling of this situation has been a complete fiasco.\"Incompetence has become this Governmentrsquos watchword, whether that is on schools, testing or care homes.\"Boris Johnsonrsquos failure to lead is holding Britain back.Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrats education spokeswoman said the move was a \"victory for common sense\", demanded the education secretary resign and the Prime Minister apologise.She said: \"Despite the warnings, the Education Secretarys botched handling of grade awards has left countless young people stressed and anxious. The Prime Minister must show leadership and personally apologise for his Governments shambles.\"This U-turn is victory for common sense and rightly answers calls from Liberal Democrats and others, but it should never have gotten this far.\"While it is embarrassing for the Government, it has been excruciating for students. It is clear the Education Secretary is out of his depth. If he doesnt walk, he must be pushed.\"She also called for an independent review of the process which led to the bungled grading."},{"url":null,"title":"trial-alex-salmond-bbc2-review","story":"BBC iPlayer***AN Edinburgh morning in spring.

The independence movement is bigger than any politician, bigger than any split and certainly bigger than the SNP and should the SNP ship ever become holed below the waterline, there is an ample supply of leboats in the waiting.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.YOUR Saturday columnist Struan Stevenson this week holds forth on economics and politics . If, like me, your readers were hoping for cogent analysis and logical thinking they would have been disappointed.His theme is SNP grievance, but Mr Stevensonrsquos article is redolent with his own grievance that by some inexplicable paradox, support for both the SNP and independence is steadily rising while all around, all he sees is failure and despair.He berates SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford for taunting him with the mantra of ldquotoo wee, too poor, too stupid. However, he then attempts, with the aid of some dubious back of an envelope calculations, to demonstrate that Scotland is essentially bankrupt, unable to support a currency or public services and unable to achieve equivalence with countries such as Ireland or Denmark. He opines we are so economically toxic that Scotland would be shunned by the EU.Does Mr Stevenson really believe that  And,he does, is it a good reason for persisting with a -year-old Union which has left us in such penury He then recycles the tired arguments of Better Together circa . Discovering oil was an economic disaster, Scotlandrsquos deficit is the largest in Europe, we are totally dependent on the largesse of London and so on. For Mr Stevenson and those of his ilk, any thought of constitutional change can only be measured against the yardstick of his version of economics. Itrsquos all about bawbees and siller in your pocket, especiallyyoursquore a higher rate taxpayer.The answer to his paradox, of course, is not to be found in balance sheets or economic statistics. Itrsquos staring him in the face. Since  Scotland has voted decisively against Brexit and three Tory governments, yet all have been imposed by the Union. Thatrsquos where the grievance lies and thatrsquos the reason for the increasing support for the SNP and Independence.Iain Gunn, Elgin.STRUAN Stevenson states that it would ldquocost around pound billion to establish our own currency. He has, however, got it this the wrong way round.To put  billion Scots Pounds into circulation, you take in pound billion Sterling in exchange. This forms the reserve as backing for the Scots currency, although I would suggest that some of the Sterling be sold in exchange for gold and or dollars, since Sterling is a very weak currency, and the Scots pound would be stronger. The reason for this is that the UK has, for a good number of years, been running a trade deficit, usually at least pound billion annually, whereas Scotland has, since records began, always shown a balance of trade surplus, currently around pound billion a year.Older readers like me will remember the post-war mantra ldquoexport or die, the IMF bail-out when James Callaghan was Chancellor and the conditions imposedand the fall of Sterling from the post-war  to the pound to . to the pound now.Since the last world war, about  countries have become independent. Nearly all established their own currency very quickly with no fuss, little expense, and a lot of advantages.But maybe Mr Stevenson would have preferred to stay with the Titanic rather than risk a leboat.Ian Macdonald, Bearsden.STRUAN Stevenson repeats the mantra about Scotlandrsquos ldquodeficit, ignoring as usual that, whatever this figure is supposed to actually represent, it is mostly generated as a result of mismanaged fiscal powers reserved by the UK Government. The Scottish Government, allowed very limited fiscal freedoms, balances its budget every year. When was the last time the UK managed to do this  Elsewhere he refers to Scotlandrsquos Covid- death rate being higher than Norwayrsquos, a unionist deceit since, again, it was the delayed, incompetent deployment of powers reserved to the UK Government that resulted in the unnecessary deaths of our fellow Scots.These are but two typical examples of the flimsiness of the unionist cause.

They also said increased vitamin D levels could be protective for people with the dementia gene.The AD gene - Apolipoprotein endash is a major genetic risk factor for the disease, and is found in around a quarter of the population. It increases the risk of developing dementia by at least three times.The researchers looked at a wide range of blood molecules ndash including cholesterols, markers of inflammation, vitamin D, sex-specic hormones and renal- in people carrying the AD gene to better understand the mechanisms of it and the risk of developing dementia.The study found relatively large associations of neuro-inflammatory and cholesterol biomarkers, such as low-density lipoprotein levels, in people with a genetically-high risk of Alzheimerrsquos.Previous studies also reported an association between APOE e and higher vitamin D levels however, this study found decreased levels.Dr Donald Lyall, public health lecturer at the Universityrsquos Institute of Health and Wellbeing and senior author, said: ldquoOur research confirmed that the [dementia gene] predicted subsequent dementia.\"But, more importantly, by looking at such a large sample size and such a wide range of biomarkers ndash both in patients with the disease and those currently non-demented but at high genetic riskndash we were able to get a lsquobig picturersquo look at the role of common biomarkers and this gene, which is considered to be dementia-causing.ldquoOur findings of relatively-large associations between [the gene] with neuro-inflammatory biomarkers and elevated cholesterol levels, reinforces that these biological pathways are important to our understanding of common, late-onset Alzheimerrsquos disease.ldquoWhile these findings could suggest biomarkers for dementia, further studies are needed to fully determine their role in dementia, both in those with a high genetic risk for Alzheimerrsquos disease and more generally.Lead author Dr Amy Ferguson added: ldquoWe hope that, by continuing to understand biomarkers of those at genetic risk of AD, we can one day use them in early detection of AD and, hopefully, potential pathways for future prevention, management and treatment options.Alzheimerrsquos disease is the most common form of dementia, and is believed to be the result of interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors.News of the biomarker research comes after it was reported that a blood test could spot Alzheimers disease at the earliest stage and years before symptoms appear, according to US and Swedish researchers.The test looks for tiny amounts of a protein which is elevated in people with the illness.Investigators found measuring this protein, p-tau, could predict Alzheimers dementia with % accuracy.Experts said that with more research, it could be developed into a test doctors could offer to patients.Currently, Alzheimers is diagnosed using a combination of memory tests and brain scans, once symptoms have already appeared.The idea of a dementia blood test is not new, but the two latest studies give the clearest indication yet that a protein associated with Alzheimers disease could be used to diagnose people at a much earlier stage.The University of Glasgow study is published today in the Journal of Alzheimerrsquos Disease.

HIAL’s previous engagement on the ATMS programme has been on a face-to-face basis. However, Mr Matthew is working with local authorities to determine the best way to engage with community groups given the current restrictions due to Coronavirus.Reference Economic Consultants is currently contacting community representatives as part of the consultation process and Mr Lyon encourages those contacted to engage with the process saying: “It is important that local representatives contribute to the assessment of potential economic and community impacts.“HIAL looks forward to receiving the report with the findings from Reference Economic Consultants following completion of the consultation phase.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will require the Scottish Government to invest in lower emission modes of transport, including more fuel efficient ferries.“Orkney’s internal ferry service is a perfect example. This leline for our island communities is operated by ageing vessels, which are costly to run, damaging to the environment and no longer fit for purpose.“Scottish Ministers should therefore be looking to agree on a replacement programme with Orkney Islands Council that would introduce more fuel-efficient vessels that cut emissions, cost less to operate and provide our island communities with the service they need and deserve.“If the Scottish Government is genuinely committed to meeting its climate change objectives, and treating our islands with fairness, replacement of these vessels must now be a priority.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system. By contrast, for the least deprived pupils, the predicted . per cent for A-C grades was lowered to . per cent.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that it would not be “credible” to have accepted the high pass rates as recommended by teachers.The First Minister and education secretary John Swinney both urged pupils to appealthey feel they have been treated unfairly.Both Highland Council and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar have said overall pass rates in the region were up on the previous year"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Shieling-on-Barvas-River-I-F-Grant-Collection-Edinburgh-Central-Library-2-scaled.jpg","title":"digging where we stand memories from the airigh shieling for a post covid new","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineOur hyper-globalised, high-octane way of le was stopped in its tracks in a matter of weeks, and many of us found ourselves confined to our local communities, with a great deal of spare time on our hands.The TaD team have – fortunately – been able to continue working from home, and over these past few months I have been lucky enough to have conversations with some of our contributors and their families, speaking about recordings from the past, but naturally reflecting on those times and comparing them with the situation we find ourselves in today.One conversation of note was with a relative of a contributor who was recorded in the early s., the ethnologist and previous TaD columnist, Mairi MacFadyen, referred to Alastair McIntosh’s idea that we should ‘dig where we stand’ in order to find meaning and to regain a ‘sense of place’.Mairi then explains: “The idea is that by researching and learning about our own history and the place we are living, we – as iniduals and as groups – can regain some control over the understanding of our lives and our inter-connectedness..”, or the shieling. – the seasonal moving of livestock and people, still practiced today in many parts of the world including the mountainous regions of Norway, Alpine and sub-Alpine Europe, and the Pyrenees.In the Highlands, the practice was widespread until the early to mid-th century when much of the moorland on which the communites had their shielings were claimed by the landowners and used for sheep runs, and for hunting., where the contributors are well aware of the custom of going to the shieling in their parents’ and grandparents’ generation... # of the sheep.Historically, this allowed the unenclosed crops in the township to grow undisturbed, and it allowed the livestock to take advantage of the superior seasonal grazing on the hills.. – the first day of may.The flitting took a lot of effort, but it was also a time full of excitement, for man and beast:., including cats for hunting the rats, but according to Donald MacDonald, dogs were not taken to the àirigh.On the first day the men would prepare the shieling huts, and the women would prepare a meal for everyone who had helped with the move, before leaving the children and younger women once everything was prepared.In Lewis the people stayed at the àirigh until the beginning of August., and they would come home at the weekends to go to church, often bringing fresh milk with them.. recited here in  by the Rev.

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

These have been in the following council areas: Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council , Ards and North Down Borough Council , Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council , Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council , Mid and East Antrim Borough Council , and Newry, Mourne and Down District Council .In addition, there have been  clusters across Northern Ireland with fewer than five people.These figures are up to pm on th August . Cases in a smaller cluster may also be associated with a larger cluster, for example a common geographic location or common social setting.The PHA will be publishing cluster data on a weekly basis each Thursday until further notice.A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period.Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings. COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters.The PHA’s Contact Tracing Servicecontinues to engage successfully with the vast majority of identied contacts and provide appropriate advice to help prevent any onward spread.Over the week up to pm on th August , the number of positive tests reported to the CTS was  – the number of positive cases requiring contact tracing was . There were  positive cases that completed contact tracing, and  contacts identied. There were  contacts successfully contacted and advised. [see Notes to Editors for further explanation of these figures]Since July, the average number of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing.Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app.“This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts.“Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters.Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings.“Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful.“We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.”Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible. For further information on the virus, its symptoms and how to book a test, visit www.pha.site coronavirusWe must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.If you receive a positive test result you will be contacted by the PHA’s Contact Tracing Service from .Members of the public are also encouraged to download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app on Android or Apple, which complements the work of the Contact Tracing Service.

A really great day. When I heard the news that Peter Weir was allowing centre-assessed grades from teachers to be used for GCSE students# results on Thursday but was staying firm on A-levels, I and so many others were outraged at one set of rules for one and a dferent set for the other. After hearing the news that A-level students are now being awarded their teacher centre-assessed grades, I am delighted.It has been a turbulent few days for students, parents, s, teachers and so many others who helped to U-turn this decision. I have spoken to fellow students who have come forward to tell their story, as well as many courageous parents who spoke out against their children being wronged.The pressure from the media and people coming forward to share their stories has told.We owe a huge debt of gratitude to every journalist who asked the tough questions that needed answering to every teacher for their hard work in preparing our grades with the sufficient evidence to every politician who stood up for us, and to every single person who put pressure on Mr Weir to do the right thing.As a result of young people stepping up and speaking out to challenge Mr Weir and Justin Edwards, who heads up CCEA, we have finally got the grades we deserve.I am thrilled with the result for students in Northern Ireland and I am so glad teachers have been listened to and their professionalism acknowledged.It does disappoint me that all of this could have been avoidedMr Weir had considered the future of young people receiving results on Thursday before now. We cannot go back in time, but we can certainly learn lessons from this.It cannot be ignored that the A-level fiasco has had a negative impact on the mental health of young people.It must be considered that young people lost out on the traditional rites of passage after secondary school: the farewells to teachers and other students, the end-of-school parties and summer holiday plans.The added trauma of not receiving fair A-level grades was devastating for so many of us and the past few days have been dficult. I#m glad we can now work to move forward and get back on track - but it shouldn#t have been like this.I often read young people have the power to change the world and today that quote couldn#t be more true. We have the power to use our voice and in recent days people have used their s in incredible ways. We were failed. But we fought for what we believed in as a team, and we have won.And that is something we all should be so very proud of.Jamie Harkin is head boy of Drumragh Integrated College, Omagh  Belfast   Most ReadJamie Bryson#s Amateur League dispute could halt entire football seasonWatch: James Nesbitt#s words of love and respect at funeral for dad JimThree Belfast restaurants close after staff test positive for Covid -#We will miss him more than words can say# - James Nesbitt in moving tribute as dad laid to restSinister picture of republican #gunman# near Derry#s Bogside bonfires,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I hope today#s decision will provide a  for [students] to go forward positively into higher education, employment or training.More than a third of A-level grades issued last Thursday were lower than teacher estimates.The proportion of A* to A A-level grades rose by .%.In total, % were lowered while .% were raised.A-level and GCSE students in England and Wales will also be given estimates by their teachers.Robert Wilson, Northern Ireland regional officer of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: We welcome the decision to put an end to the grading fiasco of using only standardised grades.NUS-USI students# union president Ellen Fearon said the decision was a huge relief to students who have faced months of uncertainty already.She added: This victory belongs to students who would not accept their futures being decided by an unjust algorithm.UUP MLA Robbie Butler said: This is a fair and just resolution so that students can make the decisions that best suit their future educational and career paths. I am glad that the Department of Education has now accepted that it is right to place trust in teachers to grade students# A-level work.However, the question will be asked why did it have to be this way  This decision could have been made long before now. It#s very late in the day. Students have been put through immense stress. Given that mental health is the number one issue for young people this has only piled misery upon misery.Alliance MLA Chris Lyttle said: While this news is welcome, we are not through the woods just yet. The Education Minister#s delay has risked many pupils missing their university place. We now need a prompt delivery of the new grades and support for those who need it to move on in their educational career.SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan said: This is a win for our teachers and their professional judgement, but most importantly, a win for our young people.They fought tirelessly against the flawed standardisation process and for grades that accurately reflected their ability and their work ethic.Green Party education spokesperson, Councillor Simon Lee, said: The Education Minister has made this U-turn as a result of pressure from teachers, parents and pupils. Credit to them for demanding an equitable resolution to this fiascoIt#s been a fiasco that was entirely foreseeable since problems with standardisation began to emerge with the publication of results in Scotland. Many students have been through a horrible ordeal as Peter Weir wobbled his way through this matter.Belfast Related ContentVideoEducationNI A-level pupils to receive teacher-assessed or exam board grade, whichever is highest, Education Minister Peter Weir says after back-to-back U-turns Education Minister Peter Weir has announced a dramatic U-turn over how AS and A-level grades in Northern Ireland will be awarded.CoronavirusNew lockdown restrictions comingCovid- cases continue to rise in Northern Ireland - SwannThirty-nine new cases of Covid- were confirmed in Northern Ireland on Monday amid fresh warnings that localised lockdowns could be introduced.News Analysis PremiumAlan HutchinsonOpinionLet#s give full credit to Mr Weir ... eventually he did the right thingAfter a long day of entering examination results appeals on behalf of many of the students of Glastry College, I was absolutely delighted when at .pm a message popped up on my phone: #A-level U turn!# Most ReadJamie Bryson#s Amateur League dispute could halt entire football seasonWatch: James Nesbitt#s words of love and respect at funeral for dad JimThree Belfast restaurants close after staff test positive for Covid -Sinister picture of republican #gunman# near Derry#s Bogside bonfiresNI man dropped trousers and asked woman was she a Catholic,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

With another  cases confirmed yesterday, that is  in just four days.On Saturday the Republic#s health authorities announced  cases there.The UK and Irish Republic have already begun to impose localised lockdowns in areas with high cases of the virus. Yesterday Stormont#s chief scientic adviser said the same approach could be taken here.Suddenly the outlook is a lot less optimistic than it had appeared.In May the Executive introduced its five-stage plan for exiting the lockdown. While many restrictions have been lted, some - including the reopening of wet pubs - have still to be acted on, amid lingering concerns of a second wave.The road map:On May  the Executive published its five-stage recovery strategy.Included in the first step of the plan were proposals for groups of four to six people to meet outside, churches to be permitted to open for private prayer, outdoor sports including golf and tennis to resume and more people encouraged toto work. Garden centres and large outdoor retailers were also permitted to reopen.In step two, up to  people could meet outdoors, while two to four people could meet indoors for short periods. Sports training would be allowed to resume and non-food retailers would be allowed to reopen.Step three would enable up to  people to meet outdoors along with the reopening of museums and galleries, with theatre rehearsals allowed to resume. Large indoor gatherings would be authorised, while the phasedof office working would be encouraged. Children were also set toto school on a part-time basis.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBishop of Down and Connor, Noel Treanor celebrates Mass under strict social distancing in St Peter’s Cathedral, west Belfast this morning.

Masks are also mandatory on public transport - although again enforcement is largely non-existent - and will be strongly encouraged for activities involving large numbers of staff or pupils in an enclosed space.Expert#s views:Queen#s University Belfastvirologist Dr Connor Bamford said that he believed Northern Ireland#s coronavirus lockdown had been successful.He said that the virus had been slowed down with cases being reported in single and double digits most days.However, while lockdown had worked well, he believes the virus was always present in Northern Ireland.We were always detecting cases and we were always seeing small clusters that would pop up in dferent parts of the country, he said.Dr Bamford said it was anticipated that, as restrictions were relaxed, cases would rise because the virus was present and most people remained susceptible. He said contact tracing had played a key role in identying new cases and clusters in Northern Ireland.The virologist, who emerged as one of Northern Ireland#s experts on the virus, said a dynamic approach was needed to deal with the virus going forward.We#re not out of the woods yet, certainly we would like to be able to reduce restrictions safely, but then we might have to bring in more restrictions as has been seen in other parts of the UK, Dr Bamford said.I would imagine nothing is off the table, we could be looking at lockdowns by city, or county or even given the size of Northern Ireland they may just decide to lockdown the entire country, it will depend purely on the circumstances surrounding the outbreak.Dr Bamford said the virus seemed to now be affecting more younger people as they were taking more risks as lockdown eased.We just can#t go back completely to normal until we have a very good vaccine, he said.We have to think of it as the #new normal#, it isn#t going to be forever, there will be a time when we won#t worry about Covid, but until then this is what the new normal has to be.However the virologist said he didn#t believe we were seeing the beginning of a second wave of the virus.I wouldn#t say that at this stage, but you#ll see with things like schools going back or large changes to lockdown, they all might sort of come together and you might see something that looks like the beginning of a second wave or a large outbreak, he said.Dr Bamford praised the Executive#s fluid approach to managing the pandemic. However, he believes a policy of eradicating the virus should be pursued.I think more could be done to get rid of the virus in Northern Ireland and then it might be safer to reopen schools, he said.At the minute we#re all sort of responding to outbreaks, what happenswe really went after the virus and eradicated the virus from the country I think there#s a lot to be said about that because then you might not have to make the choice between opening schools or pubs.You need to find where that virus is and really go after it with more testing, community testing, but we#re not really doing that and we#re more managing the outbreaks. That could be a risky strategy.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Connor Bamford FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Connor BamfordUlster Bank economist Richard Ramsey said that even before the lockdown was introduced businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector, saw a downturn in custom and demand.He said when businesses were told to close, those who didn#t have cash reserves found themselves left exposed.However, Mr Ramsey said the scale of the support provided to businesses during lockdown was huge.If you thought beforehand that they would introduce things like a furlough scheme or eat out to help out, it wouldn#t have been thought possible, the economist said.While he accepted that some people may think not enough support has been provided, Mr Ramsey said that he believed further measures would be forthcoming.The chancellor isn#t done providing stimulus yet, we expect to see more in the autumn, it will be more targeted and dferent from what we#ve seen, it#s not the end of it, he said.Mr Ramsey said he believed businesses had come through the worst of the pandemic.We#ve seen huge falls in lockdown, it stopped dead, but you#ve then seen recovery, the corner had been turned in terms of activity, he said.He cautioned that the jobs market was one area that was set to get worse in the months to come.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseUlster Bank economist Richard Ramsey FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappUlster Bank economist Richard RamseyMy view:If the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise, then the Executive will have some very dficult decisions to make.Despite spending much of the past few years engaging in petty public squabbles, the parties came together when the outbreak began, just months after Stormont#s institutions were restored.Now as cases look to be on the rise once again, our politicians will have to decide what steps are necessary to halt the spread of the virus.Rolling back on any lockdown easements could be met with widespread public resistance.One only has to look at the debate created by the mandatory wearing - and, in some cases defiance - of masks to see the public has become weary of widespread government intervention in their lives.However, the Executive must do what it deems necessary to protect public health.If we continue to see Covid clusters developing in certain areas then we are more likely to see localised lockdowns, but the question remains how effective would this be in a country the size of Northern Ireland.Just a few short weeks ago cases were in the single figures, businesses and public facilities were reopening, people were ing to work and beginning to foresee ato some normality.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ab .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ebd---af-acbdc_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Doses of the Oxford vaccine PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDoses of the Oxford vaccine Now it feels like we are beginning to go backwards rather than forward.It is still unknown what effect reopening schools could have on the spread of the virus.If cases continues to rise then it is likely an increased number of deaths will follow.Should we see ato daily reports of multiple Covid- deaths, the Executive will be forced to take action, no matter how unpopular it may be.The virus remains unpredictable and until we have a widely available vaccine, any hopes of ato pre-Covid times seem distant.

However, the fact that , burglaries still occurred during lockdown , even when Stormont’s most stringent quarantine measures were in place, highlights that break-ins remain a very real risk for homeowners and tenants alike.” He urged homeowners to remain vigilant and not to forego insurance despite being in their dwellings more often. “Remember to always double check doors and windows are locked when leaving your property or going to bed, set security alarms when necessary, keep valuables out of sight, apply light timers when off on holiday to make it seem like the property is occupied, and ask anyone entering your house for professional reasons for ID,” he said. Chief Superintendent Simon Walls said while he welcomed any reduction in burglary, the figures had been collated by a commercial organisation and are not official PSNI statistics.“Tackling burglary remains a priority for us and we are committed to working with local communities and police and Community Safety Partnershipsin a bid to reduce incidents and keep people safe,” he added.

A body which represents the industry, Hospitality Ulster, has told the Executive that non-food or ‘wet pubs’ have been left ‘without any hope’. A financial package from the Executive is now ‘urgently needed’ to save many businesses employing dozens of people in Derry despite hotels, restaurants, and pubs serving food operating safely since July , says Hospitality Ulster Chief Executive Colin Neill. Pubs were set to reopen on August  but a decision has now been pushed back for a number of weeks. googletag.cmd.push However, further easing of the lockdown - including the reopening of pubs - depends on the rate at which the virus is spreading in the community. Mr Neill said the Executive needs to support pubs: “Although we have an indicative date of  September, that is an eternity away and there is no guarantee that this date will even be met. “I have pressed the case for non-food pubs to be open as soon as possible, andnot, then a bespoke financial package must be delivered immediately. “The consequences of no support will mean that many jobs will be at risk, on top of those who have already been made redundant. googletag.cmd.push “We now need to take a pragmatic approach and raised with the Executive Office Ministers, a number of ways in which we can get non-food pubs open in a safe way, just like the rest of the hospitality sector.” As preparations were made to come out of lockdown in May ideas were floated such as making use of Guildhall Square and outdoor spaces in the city centre, however, those plans for the most part have not come to fruition. Derry City and Strabane District Council said it continues to meet with representatives from ious government departments and key stakeholders to proactively bring forward a number of positive initiatives aimed at assisting with the ‘safe recovery and reopening’ of the city centre. SAFE SPACES A council spokesperson said stakeholders have looked at a number of new creative and innovative ways at providing more space and a safe environment that will enhance the city centre visitor experience. She continued: “Council is very supportive of Department for Infrastructure’s desire to put measures into place within the Walled City to reduce traffic and to improve conditions for pedestrians. “We believe that this will provide assurance to the public and will assist our businesses in planning for social distancing as part of their recovery plans.” They say work is ongoing to assist with this process and to also look at how such pilot schemes could possibly be extended to Strabane and other parts of the district over time. In terms of street trading and licensing, the council is looking at ways of resolving the challenges that exist and ensuring that government guidelines and health advice are being adhered to. A temporary Pavement Cafeacute Licencing scheme has been introduced to assist hospitality retail businesses and agreed to temporarily waiver all fees associated with granting a temporary licence for a period of six months. Although pavement cafes may not be suitable for all businesses or streets, it is believed that pavement cafes may help some hospitality retail premises during the recovery phase and assist with adhering to current social distancing guidelines when they reopen. The council is currently processing  pavement cafeacute licence applications. A spokesperson added: “The council will continue to work in partnership with the department in the coming weeks to engage with businesses and the public to ensure that whatever measures are put in place are reflective of the needs of all our local stakeholders.” The council added that any changes in relation to the pedestrianisation of streets would have to be agreed by the relevant government departments and key stakeholders and in consultation with the local businesses. NEW SCHEMES The Department for Infrastructure said the minister is committed to working towards reimagining and reshaping spaces as part of an ambitious Executive recovery plan. As part of this recovery phase, there is a need to provide additional temporary pedestrian space in urban centres to accommodate social distancing. The department is working to identy where measures to re-allocate road space may be appropriate to facilitate local footway widening and social distancing. A spokesperson commented: “The department has been working closely with Derry City and Strabane District Council to devise projects in order to adapt to a new way of living, driven in part by the ongoing Covid- emergency. “Together we have already initiated a project to provide widened and pop-up cycle lanes on the Foyle Riverside in the city centre. “The department is also a member of the City Centre Economic Stakeholder Group, which is chaired by Derry City  Strabane District Council, and is focused on co-ordinating the phased and safe recovery of Derry’s city centre. “The group is exploring schemes such as footway widening, timed traffic exclusions, temporary traffic management measures and streetspace repurposing. “Further details will be announced in due course.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A body which represents the industry, Hospitality Ulster, has told the Executive that non-food or ‘wet pubs’ have been left ‘without any hope’. A financial package from the Executive is now ‘urgently needed’ to save many businesses employing dozens of people in Derry despite hotels, restaurants, and pubs serving food operating safely since July , says Hospitality Ulster Chief Executive Colin Neill. Pubs were set to reopen on August  but a decision has now been pushed back for a number of weeks. googletag.cmd.push However, further easing of the lockdown - including the reopening of pubs - depends on the rate at which the virus is spreading in the community. Mr Neill said the Executive needs to support pubs: “Although we have an indicative date of  September, that is an eternity away and there is no guarantee that this date will even be met. “I have pressed the case for non-food pubs to be open as soon as possible, andnot, then a bespoke financial package must be delivered immediately. “The consequences of no support will mean that many jobs will be at risk, on top of those who have already been made redundant. googletag.cmd.push “We now need to take a pragmatic approach and raised with the Executive Office Ministers, a number of ways in which we can get non-food pubs open in a safe way, just like the rest of the hospitality sector.” As preparations were made to come out of lockdown in May ideas were floated such as making use of Guildhall Square and outdoor spaces in the city centre, however, those plans for the most part have not come to fruition.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Aoibhine McFlynn, from Ballyronan, was chosen for the role of ‘Cassie’ in the film, which was produced in East Susseux, England and released in cinemas on July . The plot follows a reclusive writer who forms a relationship with a young London evacuee named Frank after adopting him during World War Two. Her mum, Edele, says rubbing shoulders with stars like Gemma Arterton and Sir Tom Courtenay, has left Aoibhine keen for more acting experience. “She enjoyed it. She says she wants to do more and that’s what she wants to get into. Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Conor Cahill, a native of Cloyne in the Rebel county, began his trip in Belfast and will make his way down Ireland’s west coast before ing along its eastern seaboard. The walk, which Conor has branded the ‘Camino d’Ireland’ is a huge personal undertaking, but his chosen charity, the Ethiopian Deaf Project , is the priority. “I’m walking anyway, sosomeone  can get the benefit of it then it’s a great story for me,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I do this because it pushes my body and resets a lot of my batteries. It’s just like hard training, the benefits are fantastic.” The EDP is a committee of voluntary fundraisers dedicated to supporting deaf children in Ethiopia gain access to formal education. They place a particular emphasis on assisting deaf children from poor rural families or those who are living isolated lives. Fundraising activities, in particular their child sponsorship program, have facilitated the development of a school that is transforming the lives of the children who attend. Miriam ORegan Miriam O’Regan, secretary and founding member of the EDP, said all donations, no matter how small, are helpful. googletag.cmd.push “The money is so hard to raise that we are extremely careful on how it is spent, we know where every cent goes,” she said. “We started my chance I suppose. Myself and my husband, Patrick have two children adopted from Ethiopia, one of whom is deaf. “We then heard of a Dublin priest, Fr. Stephen Monaghan who was trying to do something to help the deaf in Ambo. “We contacted him and said we’d like to help, maybe have a coffee morning or something, the rest is history. “We raised enough to buy land, then with matched funding from Misean Cara to build and extend the school, set up a sponsorship program to support the children and their families. “Now they come with their families once a month to learn sign language and in the next few years we are hoping to get one of the bigger organisations or group to help us establish a much needed boarding house.” Conor stayed in Dungiven while travelling through Derry. Conor feels the experience of being deaf can be a lonely one, but while staying in Dungiven, he was able to meet and talk to a deaf person from the town. “Caroline, my host, took me down to the GAA club and I started talking GAA with a few lads who were down there,” he said. “With social distancing, I was kind of sat in the corner and a deaf lad was brought over by a few of the lads. “I knew straight away he was deaf, so we were signing back and forward and it’s a lovely experience to have. “The other experience I had of that was in a place called Matera, in the south of Italy. I went into a restaurant last year and there were two people signing. “Eventually I went over and introduced myself and signed my name to them. We spent an hour and a half, between signing and texting and talking - communicating. “They told me that, over the three weeks they had travelled from Hamburg, I was the first person that had made any attempt to engage with them. “It’s a tough way to live. Three weeks on holidays and no one making any effort to communicate with them.”  Having already been to Derry City, Conor was keen to experience what rural County Derry had to offer when he was planning his trip. “I had been to Derry [City] before so I decided I didn’t want to go back through the city again, and I wanted to see rural Northern Ireland as much as I could,” he said. “It was great to come through the county and put places to the names, like Slaughtneil from the GAA side of it. “I loved the shared community spirit as that’s dferent in the north. The word ‘community’ is used a lot more. “I did have a chuckle, though, coming through some towns and seeing the signs from winning the  Tidy Towns’ award in . “When you walk Italy, you get an ancient sense of history. When you walk Ireland, our history is a more recent history.” Conor, along with the EDP, is running a ‘Guess the Steps’ competition. Entry is via donation and can be accessed on the EDP website - www.edp-ambo.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Phil Gordon, who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, says the ‘milk float’ stereotype is outdated and inaccurate. “There are fantastic cars to drive. People have an image that they’re like a milk float, but they’re very powerful cars and fantastic to drive,” he said. “I’ve been saving about pound, a year since I went electric. I do about , miles a year down to Dublin and between Derry and Letterkenny regularly and it suits me perfectly. googletag.cmd.push “I could never go back to a petrol or diesel car. It’s just frustrating they’re not making it easier for more people to get on board.” While the price of EVs is higher than a standard internal combustion enginecar, Derry man Ronan McElholm says the cost of petrol or diesel often means a saving on electric cars. “There is a massive saving. People look at the price of the car and compare it to their petrol or diesel, but you have to factor in the fuel that you use,” he said. “You could easily spend pound, on diesel in three years and then there’s the service costs. The servicing of an electric car is very minimal. googletag.cmd.push “Most of your breaking is regenerative, so it recharges the batteries and brake pads have been known to last , miles on an electric car. “There isn’t as much wear on brakes or tyres, it doesn’t need serviced as much and when you go to sell it, the residual value of the car will be so much more than any combustion engine car. “People have to look at the bigger picture. I would love to see every car become electric.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.

Stendhal Festival Presents: Unlocked, due to take place in Limavady in the last week of August, would have been the first ever series of socially distant outdoor music gigs in Northern Ireland. However, after receiving advice from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Advisor, organisers have had no choice but to cancel the event. The advice said the festival was likely to cause a signicant risk to public health. A statement from the festivals Board of Directors said they were disappointed with the decision, but that it left them with no choice. googletag.cmd.push As a result of this advice from the CMO and CSA and due to the fact that the R rate is on the rise along with the number of localised clusters and confirmed cases across Northern Ireland, we have no alternative but to make the decision to cancel all of the proposed events, a spokesperson said. From the outset we said that while we would do everything within our power to get the events approved, we would always put public health first and act on guidance provided by Government. We are disappointed for all the acts on the bill who were hoping to get back on stage doing what they do best, for the people who supported us and believed in us by purchasing tickets, for those who were to be involved in the production element of the festival, the traders and the event staff who were hoping to secure some income from the events. googletag.cmd.push We would like to thank everyone who supported us on this quest to get festivals back on the agenda post lock-down, in particular our amazing team of volunteers and our local Councillors in Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, who made a brave decision to support our endeavours in June. We await more detailed feedback on our Risk Assessment and Event Plan from the Department of Health in the hope that further clarity can be gained on the specic threats outdoor gatherings may pose to the public. These documents can still help be a factor in getting outdoor gigs back on the agenda,not for us now, for others in the arts and music industry going forward. The organisers said refunds for tickets would be available on the website by the end of the week.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan OrsquoHiggins opened the scoring early on before Jerome Johnston and Marty Devlin replied for the Ulster champions.The industrious Paddy Sheridan levelled matters in the tenth minute with Martin McCourt giving the Magpies the slightest lead by the water break.Both sides continued to probe before half time with scores hard to come by. Miceal Rooney put Kilcoo two clear five minutes from the short whistle, while OrsquoHiggins scored a beauty right on half time to leave it - to - to Mickey Moranrsquos side.The lsquoFord got the best possible start to the second half with Conor Maginn and substitute Cathal Burns finding their range to put them ahead. It was tit for tat for the next phase of the game and with ten minutes left Kilcoo lead by one thanks to scores from Jerome Johnston, Paul Greenan and Conor Laverty.The games turning point came on the rd minute. A brilliant move involving Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Ryan Johnston and Miceal Rooney placed the ing Ceilum Doherty in and he palmed home from close range.The home side never gave in though and showed great resolve, Marc Reid even coming up to point from distance in what was a superb inidual score and one of the highlights of the game.But the Magpies held out, Doherty adding a good score to seal the three-point victory margin.Bryansford: Marc Reid , Stephen Toner, Ryan McDonald, Aaron McDonald, Timmy Hanna, Conor Maginn , Danny Savage , Fintan Canavan, Conor Devlin, Corey Laverty, Ryan OrsquoHiggins , Paddy Sheridan , Thomas McAnerney, David McKenna, Daniel McDonald.Subs used: Cathal Burns , Chris Clarke , Jack Maginn, Niall OrsquoHiggins, Lewis Casement.Cill Chua: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Ryan McEvoy, Tiernan Fettes, Miceal Rooney , Darryl Branagan, Eugene Branagan, Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Paul Greenan , Shealan Johnston, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty , Martin Devlin , Ryan Johnston, Niall McEvoy.Subs used:Ceilum Doherty , Felim McGreevy.Referee: Neil Cousins .Bryansford -Cill Chua -ACFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick motorists facing further disruption  ","story":"MOTORISTS are bracing themselves for five weeks of town centre disruption in Downpatrick.Work on a pound, sewer improvement scheme starts next week, with NI Water contractors focusing on key areas.They include New Bridge Street, Church Street, Bridge Street, Saul Street, Saul Road, Marian Park, Drumlin Park, Scotch Street, Market Street, Market Lane, Stream Street, Racecourse Hill, Ardglass Road, Edward Street, Knocknashinna Road and the Knockchree Road.A number of short lane closures are expected, with two-way traffic maintained at all locations using temporary traffic controls.Vehicular access for residents and businesses will also be maintained as far as possible but there may be some slight delays according to NI Water which has confirmed that pedestrian access will be available at all times. Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick Cricket.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across the district and to review the car park tarf of p an hour, with a reduction in the hourly rate being considered.Cllr Sharvin said while shoppers will not have to pay to park for almost two more weeks, he has vowed to continue working with local businesses to ensure that the local authority is doing everything it can do to support them.He added: ldquoWith this feedback from local businesses, I would not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to the new way of working.She also highlighted the need for the local authority to press ahead with its car parking strategy and for an equitable charging system across the

Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 United.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness. Itrsquos said that lsquounited we stand, ided we fallrsquo but we have no intention of falling anytime soon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11502604.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
