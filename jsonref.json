But for many people having a period is more than a slight inconvenience. When you consider that a woman has on average 450 periods in her lifetime and will spend up to £4,800 on tampons and sanitary towels alone, lack of access to period products is a real issue.Period poverty – the umbrella term used to describe lack of access to sanitary products due to financial restrictions – is worryingly common here in the UK.Homeless women, asylum seekers and refugees are particularly at risk, but a survey from Plan International reveals that one in 10 school girls in the UK have been unable to afford sanitary products, and 12 per cent have had to improvise using socks or newspapers. For generations women across the country have been living without access to sanitary products because they can’t afford them, but period poverty isn’t going away on its own. Access to period care is a basic human right, and considering that it affect half of the world’s population, it’s about time all women had access to tampons and pads. Here’s what you can do to help, whatever your income: The easiest and fastest way to drive change is by offering financial support to your local food bank, or charities and organisations like Bloody Good Period, who supply sanitary products to refugees and asylum seekers, If you’re not in the position to donate money directly, many brands have ‘give back’ schemes when you buy their products. Freda, an organic and eco-friendly period subscription service, donates a portion of their profits to initiatives worldwide tackling period poverty. Hey Girls offers a new type of sanitary pad which claims to be ‘leak free and comfortable’ as well as being chlorine and bleach free, and for every pack you buy they donate one to a girl in need. Since you have to buy pads and tampons on a regular basis, might as well help out women in need while you’re doing it.Boys should also be taught about periods (Picture: Ella Byworth for )The fact that period products aren’t free, let alone that they’re (still) taxed as a ‘luxury’, is infuriating, but being able to afford them is a privilege we often take for granted. There’s a slew of different sanitary products available, from pads and tampons to absorbent knickers and cups, all which can be donated (unused, obviously). You can search for your local food bank here and donate some products yourself, or go the extra mile and start a collection drive through initiatives like the Red Box Project, who provides free sanitary items to school girls, and The Homeless Period, which gives homeless women free access to period products. Want to make a morning out of it? Consider hosting a period brunch. Bear with me, it’s not as gross as it sounds. The initiative is called Bloody Big Brunch, and all you need to do is invite your friends over for brunch and serve Bloody Marys – that your guests have to pay for with a packet of period products, which you then donate.Period poverty ultimately requires political action, but luckily there’s plenty you can do help ensure that government have proper policy in place.You can start by joining the #FreePeriods campaign started by teen activist Amika George, which calls for girls from low income families to be given free menstrual products.  At the time of writing the online petition already has over 159,000 signatures, but more are needed.‘To me, as women, we face so many challenges in achieving true equality in society, and it seemed completely unfair that something as normal and natural as periods should hold us back further,’ says Ms George, who is currently studying for her A levels.‘I was really shocked that the government had refused to take action so I decided to try and lobby them so that these girls could be helped.‘Whether you flood your MP’s inbox with emails, or tweet incessantly telling them to make change happen, it does make a difference. ‘Campaigning is all about seeing a need for change, and then charging forward with every ounce of energy that you have to orchestrate that change.’Society’s inability to talk openly and honestly about female issues (or vaginas) not only ensures that periods remain a taboo, but also allows the patriarchy to prevent women from taking control of their own bodies. Menstruation is still often perceived as shameful, so much so that 48 per cent of girls aged 14-21 feel embarrassed by their periods, while 71 per cent have felt embarrassed buying sanitary products. The stigma underpins the real reason period poverty is so hard to talk about it – because most people feel like they can’t, or shouldn’t.Silence isn’t always golden, and talking about periods loud and proud is the only way to end the taboo surrounding them. ‘An important part of what I’m trying to achieve is to destigmatise periods,’ says Ms George. ‘We need to re-frame menstruation and stop being ashamed of our bodies. As women, we really need to start normalising conversations about our periods. Until that happens, it’ll continue to be a topic that has men running for the hills.Education about menstruation is also essential, and not just for girls, but young boys too. It’s vital that we’re all taught about periods in order to dispel myths and end the shame surrounding menstruation. It might seem like a small thing, but little by little proper knowledge about periods will lead to a society that recognises periods as a natural part of life rather than something disgusting or embarrassing.

There’s no shame in a self-love sesh), we asked a bunch of people their masturbation routines.Do they light ten candles and play Enya in the background? Are they more of the ‘bash it out quickly in the loos’ type?Turns out there’s a real range in the preparation people put into their wank seshes.All names have been changed for reasons of privacy.‘I masturbate at least six times on weekdays, eight or more on weekends. I usually plan my day around it.‘Twice in the morning (first thing when I wake up and then in the shower), twice at work when I go for “toilet breaks”, and at least twice in the evenings.‘I have a wardrobe with costumes I like to wear depending on the fetish porn I’m watching. It’s the reason I live alone because I need the privacy.’‘I only do it when in alone in my flat so it’s normally on a midweek day off, in the afternoon is my fave time.‘I close the curtains, lock my cat in another room (otherwise he hears the vibrations and triess to attack, not cool). Normally I just watch porn on my phone and use a vibrator of some variety.’‘At least five times a day. You sometimes hit the wall at three, but you need to power through.‘Firstly I light a few candles, cinnamon really gets me going.‘Once I’m tumescent, I take off all my clothes looking directly into a mirror, never taking my eyes off my helmet. At this point I am ready.‘I squat down in front of the mirror and beat away at myself.’‘No real routine. Usually in bed or sometimes if a day off in the shower, depending on how i was feeling. Just ’til it feels like a natural end.’‘I stupidly signed a 12 month contract on a flat with my (at the time) girlfriend. We ended within a couple of months.‘So my routine is quickly, before the ex gets back, using my phone for porn.’‘I try not to do the same thing every time because I read this terrifying article about how doing the same thing every time can make you unable to come any other way.’‘Sometimes they’re planned treats. My ‘dessert’ after dinner, the ceremonial way to see in and out the weekend, it’s Wednesday, etc.‘Sometimes they’re not planned at all and I’ve just accidentally seen half a tit on a commercial ad or suddenly remembered Michaela Strachan.‘I’d say I feel closest to God after I’ve ejaculated thrice in a week, so I present my case to a human woman and then see myself past the goalposts.‘Porn helps, and I normally stick to the big guns before it’s show time IF I’m choking the chicken from a laptop. That said, I require very little set-up and have actually laid the foundations for a very mobile operation.‘I live in a house-share at the moment, so I need to have some wits about me. If it’s quiet, I’ll play music to drown out the faps – but then I guess it’s a red flag to be playing early-2000s R\u0026ampB 25 minutes after I’ve said goodnight.‘I have no go-to porn category. I’d never watch the same video twice but I like picking from the Russian roulette of the first homepage carousel and playing with the cards you’re dealt with.’‘I do it because the stimulation from my bullet isn’t something you can get from toy-less sex and it feels amazing, but don’t do it often because I prefer sex in general and my boyfriend and I live together so I don’t feel like I need to all that often.‘Setup would be checking there’s no danger of being interrupted, lying on or in my bed and usually have low lighting but close my eyes anyway.‘Tend to mostly or fully undress before starting but depends how long I’m dedicating to it and whether I’ve just showered or I’m fitting it in during the day.’‘I dim the lights, get out some lavender oil to set the mood, I insert the biggest butt plug I have into my anal cavity and stroke my meat wagon with passion.’‘Probably once a fortnight? Maybe more? So not often, but I find that I usually do it more when I’m due on my period.‘Sometimes I feel like I need to watch porn to get myself going, as it were, sometimes I don’t need to, it depends.‘I can usually have multiple orgasms and be done within 30 to 45 mins.‘I don’t use ‘tools’ much anymore. I haven’t got a vibrator and (I’m back living at home) and I found the bullet too noisy and it was making me paranoid so I just use my fingers instead.’‘Daily before, weekly now #womaninmylife is here.‘Sometimes I use the old fashioned method of using my imagination, but recently I’ve actually got into watching porn.‘I have a vibrator which I hardly use anymore. I prefer the natural method.’‘Depending on how the day unfolds, it will either be before or after work. However, there have been a few occasions which the stress of the day has taken its toll, leaving me with no other option but to have a little time of pleasure to myself – not ideal in a public cubical.‘Let’s discuss the set up at home – a little more pleasant! Firstly I set the scene with candles and sweet soul music playing softly. Then, I bring out my partner in crime – the dildo. The rest is history.’‘As a guy I normally get morning wood when I wake up. So, I would masturbate before starting my day.In the middle of the day I would do it again if say, I was bored or need a break from doing work.‘Lastly, after a long day if I couldn’t get to sleep I would masturbate again and pray this puts me to sleep. Which not to mention is another benefit: It puts to you to sleep!‘In terms of set up, the perfect timing for me is if no one is in the house or everyone is occupied in another room. I would make sure my webcams or other cameras are blocked or stored away since somehow the government may be spying on me while I have my Me Time, as well as close my curtains since other people can see me from other buildings.‘I guess I can do it anywhere in my house as long as I’m closed off from society for a while.‘For timing, I masturbate if or when I feel like doing it. Of course, it has to be in a private area and if there is even time for it. If not, I can wait until I get home.’‘No routine really. Mostly when in bed. Sometimes with porn, sometimes just when feeling turned on.’‘I’m a very routine driven person, so I stick to a schedule of once every other day.‘My routine is pretty simple. I usually go to Pornhub and find some decent videos on there. It can take anything from a few minutes to over half an hour depending on my mood andor quality of the video.’‘No real set up or routine – typically will be when chilling on the sofa watching TV or in bed before sleep.‘Some mental stimulus can help, but never really need visual aids.’‘I don’t masturbate often, so when I do it’s an event. I’m talking a long bath, fresh sheets, silky underwear.‘I struggle to find decent porn that isn’t just jackhammering and giant penises, so usually watch lesbian stuff or anything with domination. I start off with my hands and then use a vibrator on my clit.‘My room has to be tidy because otherwise I get distracted, and I play music out loud and use headphones for the porn. I’ll only do it when no one’s home because otherwise I get so worried about keeping quiet that I can’t come.’‘For porn I use Tumblr, which is probably the best system I’ve ever seen for that sort of thing since everything is linked together.‘For schedule it’s at least once in the morning in bed…I wake up before my kids do at six (since I have them every other week). There’s no music or candles.‘If it’s at night and I don’t have the kids then sometimes I’ll hit up Literotica.‘My porn “type” tends towards BDSM but that can cover pretty large genres really. Variety is the spice of life!‘And I always have some.sort of lube to use since I’m not a savage.’‘It all depends on how busy I am that week or how often I see my boyfriend. If I have a day off with nothing to do I can crack out a few in a day, but sometimes it’ll only be once or twice a week.‘If there’s no one in my flat, I’ll use a toy (they’re noisy buggers) and watch porn or read something online, and make my room look nice so i’m not distracted – make a real thing of it.‘If my housemates are in or it’s just a quickie, it can be as simple as laying down and getting the job done.’‘In a house full of people it usually happens in the toilet but if they’re all out, then I can go for it in peace. Sometimes I use sex chatlines.’‘I don’t have a routine anymore, I generally just smash it out if I remember.‘If I feel like watching some porn, then it’ll most likely be threesomelesbian.’‘No set-up.

But where?          King Edward VII is pictured with Queen Alexandra at York Cottage in 1899           Prince Henry of Wales, the Duke of Gloucester is pictured at York Cottage in September 1902George, like Harry, was the second son, not expecting to inherit the throne. But then his older brother Prince Eddy, Duke of Clarence, died suddenly aged 28.It was on his marriage that George was given what was then called the Bachelors\u0027 Cottage — built as an overspill for Sandringham\u0027s unmarried shooting guests. A man of simple tastes, he wanted nothing grander. The house had been designed by a Colonel Edis, an old friend of Edward VII, but according to biographer James Pope-Hennessy: \u0027The main drawback was that he was not an architect at all.\u0027From Edis\u0027s sketch-pad came a maze of twisting passages, narrow stairs and bedrooms the size of a housemaid\u0027s cupboard.The nursery could barely contain a small rocking-horse.

Even when he was king after his father died, George remained there while his widowed mother Queen Alexandra stayed in the big house at Sandringham.To accommodate George V and his growing family, York Cottage was extended twice — making it \u0027even odder\u0027 according to Pope-Hennessy.           Prince Albert is pictured in 1864 Queen Mary thought it was ugly, and hated it for every one of the 33 years she was forced to live there. So too did the royal children —among them our present Queen\u0027s father, George VI, and another Prince Harry — the future Duke of Gloucester.They couldn\u0027t wait to get away, but none the less were forced to spend six months of every year at York Cottage during their growing up years.There was no privacy — the place was overrun. George and Mary and their six children came first, but then there were equerries, ladies-in-waiting, private secretaries, four pages, a chef, valet, footmen, wine butlers, nurses, nursemaids, housemaids and cooks.There was nowhere for staff to sleep — \u0027the King said he supposed they roosted in the trees,\u0027 wrote biographer Kenneth Rose.And his majesty\u0027s private secretary — effectively the CEO of House of Windsor — had to use his tiny bedroom as his office, with his visitors perching on a chair in the corridor until he could greet them.No wonder, then, that with such lack of space each Christmas turned into \u0027a feast of acrimony\u0027. \u0027An atmosphere of restriction, killjoy pompousness, mystery, artificiality, and the most complete and utter boredom,\u0027 wrote David, later Edward VIII.          Inside the drawing room at York Cottage at Sandringham pictured in October 1897 \u0027And that doesn\u0027t even begin to describe how ghastly it is.\u0027There was worse. York Cottage was pervaded by the ghost of King George\u0027s elder brother Prince Eddy, who\u0027d borne the title Duke of Clarence and was expected to inherit the throne until his early death.Even today\u0027s most ardent royalists agree Prince Eddy was the worst king we never had.Recklessly promiscuous in his sex life, he suffered constantly from gonorrhea and was utterly brainless.In the army, he could not be guaranteed to turn the right way on the parade ground and forgot the orders he was supposed to issue to his men.He was embroiled in the Cleveland Street scandal, where telegraph clerks from the General Post Office were used as rent-boys in London by the titled and rich — and was urgently dispatched on a tour of India when the ringleaders were put on trial at the Old Bailey.          York Cottage at Sandringham in Norfolk is pictured from behind with its private lake But he liked women too, with his fellow officers encouraging him to try new experiences in order to ingratiate themselves.He was even suspected, then finally cleared, of being Jack The Ripper.Eddy was said to have secretly married at the age of 20 to an artist\u0027s model called Annie Crook, and later he was ensnared for his sexual high-jinks by a notorious blackmailer, Maude Richardson.He was named as the lover of a chorus girl, Lydia Miller, who committed suicide by swallowing carbolic acid.He was nothing short of a walking disaster for the Royal Family.There was a concerted effort to get Eddy married off, in the hope it would put an end to his wild ways, but finding a suitable bride proved impossible — his reputation as a brainless philanderer went before him.          Harry and Meghan are pictured attending a reception for the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London In the end Princess May of Teck, a distant cousin, agreed to the job — but just at that moment Eddy, weakened by gonorrhea, died of influenza.Weirdly, within weeks, May accepted the proposal of marriage from Eddy\u0027s younger brother George, and so became Queen Mary. Both she, and her husband,lived intimately with Eddy\u0027s ghost at Sandringham.\u0027All is left just as it was,\u0027 wrote Empress Frederick of Prussia, their cousin.\u0027His dressing-table with his watch, his brushes and combs and everything. His bed covered with a Union Jack in silk, and his photos and clothes in a glass cupboard.\u0027George\u0027s children grew up with this ghost, and couldn\u0027t wait to get away.Bertie — the present Queen\u0027s father — was on the lookout for a bride from his teens on, the only means of escape being marriage and a home of his own.His sister Princess Mary, equally desperate, accepted the hand of the Earl of Harewood, who at 40 was 16 years her senior (Harewood\u0027s reputedly proposed to her for a wager).The future Edward VIII, according to his biographer Philip Ziegler, hated York Cottage — \u0027as he grew older it came more and more to symbolise all that he disliked about family life\u0027.So nobody enjoyed the redbrick, suburban, glum and gloomy house — apart from King George. \u0027Very nice to be in this dear wee house again,\u0027 he wrote unknowingly in his diary.But no royal ever lived in it again. In 1925 he and Queen Mary moved up to the big house after the death of his mother Queen Alexandra, and the place was eventually turned into what it is today — staff offices, with a few flats tacked on.York Cottage\u0027s convenience for Meghan and Harry is that it\u0027s near to William and Kate at Anmer Hall, and should babies come along, their cousins will provide handy playmates.But a joyful place for their future family home?As Meghan has yet to learn, there are a few heavy prices you have to pay when you become a princess."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/07/4BCB952700000578-0-image-m-15_1525327815445.jpg","title":"Chris Evans pays tribute mother Minnie returns air","story":"\u0027Mum was incredible, she needed to be at peace\u0027: Listeners...Share this article    Chris Evans, pictured with his mother Minnie at London\u0027s Chelsea Flower Show in 2000\u0027My mum was only supposed to last a month or two, but five months after this, seven months in all, she was still there.

But what is Martin Lewis’s net worth?Who is Martin Lewis?Born Martin Steven Lewis on May 9, 1972 in Withington, Manchester, he is an English financial journalist and founder of the website MoneySavingExpert.com.He lost his mother in a car accident at a young age and later in life, went on to become a patron of the children’s bereavement charity Grief Encounter as well as an advocate for life insurance.Martin studied government and law at the London School of Economics and went on to complete a postgraduate course in broadcast journalism in Cardiff.His first job was at a financial communications consultancy, the Brunswick Group in London and later, became a producer for the BBC Business Unit working on BBC Radio Five Live business programmes.Martin was also an editor of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and then moved to Sky’s Simply Money where he formed his Money Saving Expert persona.After the collapse of Simply Money, he wrote for the Deal of the Week column in the Sunday Express and was then granted slots on Channel 5’s Open House with Gloria Hunniford.Martin returned to BBC for a short while before presenting a daytime television series on ITV in 2005 called Make Me Rich as well as Channel Five show It Pays to Watch.He then presented money saving programmes on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine and now appears on This Morning, The Wright Stuff and began presenting The Martin Lewis Money Show.Martin Lewis is married to former 5 News weather presenter Lara Lewington in May 31, 2009 and the couple had a daughter in November 2012.          Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis pictured with his Order of the British Empire (OBE) medal alongside his wife Lara Lewington at an Investiture ceremony in February 2015 at Buckingham PalaceMartin Lewis on Question TimeMoney Saving Expert Martin Lewis was applauded by Question Time viewers after he slammed Labour Party MP Chi Onwurah over student finance claims.He accused politicians of dissuading young people from attending university by referring to the fee payments as student ‘debt’ and said that an entire generation had been ‘mis-educated’.He said: \u0027It is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame... It\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Martin explained that the price of attending university was irrelevant and the repayments are based on salary, which means that those who earn a lot after completing their studies, will naturally have to pay back more.Ms Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central said: \u0027If somebody, and particularly somebody from a working class background, if somebody has 57,000 in debt,\u0027 but Martin interrupted her to say: ‘Don\u0027t tell them! Politicians do this all the time. You can\u0027t make political points.\u0027You put off young people from underprivileged backgrounds from going to university with a fear of debt by framing it as a debt when you know it doesn\u0027t work like that.\u0027Politicians need to take responsibility. Your political football that you and all the parties have used student finance to be has mis-educated a generation about how student finance works and it is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame because there are people from poor backgrounds on television - I saw a programme two weeks ago - saying I can\u0027t afford to go to university.\u0027Well, you know what, it is expensive, it\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Ms Onwurah responded: \u0027It is really, really important to recognise that tuition fees are an obstacle for students going into university. It\u0027s psychological but a lot of the world is psychological. How things are perceived is what informs people\u0027s choice.\u0027You can argue to re-educate, or you can argue, as we have done, to abolish tuition fees.\u0027Martin Lewis suing FacebookIn April 2018, Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis revealed that he is in the process of suing Facebook for publishing dozens of adverts using his image to promote scams.He said that the social media platform had used his name to ‘rip off vulnerable people’. He continued: \u0027I feel sick each time I hear of another victim being conned because of trust they wrongly thought they were placing in me.‘I believe politicians have totally missed the impact of social media companies on real people and their pockets. It is about time they took this seriously.’Martin went on to say that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg ‘pretends to be an honest and campaigning man but his company is a facilitator of criminal scammers … They have known about these scam adverts for years, and they are still happy to roll around in their dirty money.’Facebook has been accused of publishing more than 50 fake Martin Lewis adverts, with the majority promoting schemes trading in Bitcoin, which Martin claimed were actually binary trading firms.Binary trading is a risky form of gambling on the stock market that sees most investors lose money.The Financial Conduct Authority has said almost 100 firms are illegally offering such investments to UK consumers and warned of online firms that take money, place no bets for customers then break contact.Martin has asked Facebook to remove the adverts multiple times but they are left up for days or weeks before being taken down and then reappear days later.A Facebook spokesman said: ‘We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed.’Martin Lewis net worthMartin Lewis’s net worth has accumulated to approximately £73 million, according to Wealtholino.In 2012, BBC News reported that Martin sold MoneySavingExpert.com for up to £87 million.Marvel character searches on Pornhub surged before Avengers: Infinity War releaseJennifer Aniston joins Brad Pitt and others in objecting to The Weinstein Company saleGrey\u0027s Anatomy preview hints at Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw\u0027s leavingCinco de Mayo: How to celebrate in style Who is Matthew Lawrence?

The mast was broken, the sails in shreds and the boat itself flooded with water.The British towns where VEG has almost vanished... and why...We had to tell our children Daddy could die on Everest... we...Share this articleWhat followed was a story of good fortune, rare courage, and redemption. For more than 40 days, with her boat crippled, equipment smashed and heart broken, 23-year-old Tami somehow endured the elements threatening to annihilate her and then conquered them – and she did so thanks to the guiding spirit of her dead fiancé, whose insistent voice, day by day, had urged her on to a seemingly impossible survival.That voice, she says, brought her back from the brink, helping her navigate with just a sextant and the stars above her head.Now her ordeal and the extraordinary memoir that followed have been made into a big-budget Hollywood film, Adrift, set for release in June, and featuring British actor Sam Claflin as Richard and Shailene Woodley as Tami.Both are rising stars – Sam appeared in the film adaptation of Jojo Moyes’ novel Me Before You, while US actress Shailene played a teenage cancer patient in The Fault In Our Stars – and Adrift looks set to be this summer’s cinematic hit.Yet even the big-screen treatment could hardly be more dramatic than the true 1,500-mile solo epic that Tami describes in Red Sky In Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss And Survival At Sea, which will be re-published next month as Adrift.It was September 1983 when the two young sailors embarked on what they imagined to be a routine delivery for the Hazana’s British owners, Peter and Christine Compton.At 34, Richard was more than a decade older than his young American lover, but with his his lapis lazuli eyes, golden hair and ‘exotic’ English accent, he meant everything to her. They had already spent a year and a half together on the Pacific, delivering and mending boats.True, the distance involved in this new mission was vast, yet the pair had few concerns, as Tami later recalled in a series of moving interviews: ‘I’d been sailing blue water for four years. Together we had 50,000 miles of ocean-sailing under our belts. We hugged, laughed, made love and relaxed into 20 days of paradise.’          The couple set off on the 4,000 mile trip on board the Hazana across the Pacific OceanA disastrous reality was less than two weeks away, in the shape of tropical storm Raymond, which ‘tore out of the blue’, hit hurricane force then held its peak intensity for two catastrophic days.It was Richard who spotted a monster wave approaching the Hazana and ordered Tami below deck while he secured himself with a safety harness and tried to keep the vessel afloat.Moments later she heard him scream ‘Oh my God!’ and her world was thrust into darkness.Tossed like a cork on the raging ocean, the yacht had flipped end over end. It was 27 hours before she regained consciousness to an eerie silence and utter devastation. The cabin was half-filled with water, everything inside it smashed or scattered on the floor.Scrambling out onto the deck she looked desperately for Richard but found only wreckage. The boat was all-but destroyed: masts were broken off and the waterlogged sails floated uselessly in the water.Richard’s safety line dangled ominously off the boat. Tami shouted his name over and over again, but found only empty ocean. Richard was nowhere to be seen.

But scientists warned more vents would likely form and disgorge more lava.Hawaii Volcanoes National Park evacuated all visitors and non-emergency staff. The quakes triggered rock slides on park trails and crater walls. Narrow fissures appeared on the ground at a building overlooking the crater at Kilauea\u0027s summit.The University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College both closed campuses and a long stretch of Highway 130, one of the main arteries through Puna, was closed because of the threat of sulfuric gas.Leilani Estates, where lava was pushing through cracks in the earth, has about 1,700 residents and 770 homes.

Activity picked up earlier this week, indicating a possible new lava outbreak.The crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles  downslope toward the populated southeast coastline.Residents have faced lava threats before.In 2014, lava burned a house and destroyed a cemetery near the town of Pahoa. Residents were worried it would cover the town\u0027s main road and cut off the community from the rest of the island, but the molten rock stalled.From 1990 through 1991, lava slowly overtook the town of Kalapana, burning homes and covering roads and gardens.Kilauea hasn\u0027t been the kind of volcano that shoots lava from its summit into the sky, causing widespread destruction. It tends to ooze lava from fissures in its sides, which often gives residents at least a few hours\u0027 warning before it reaches their property.In the uncertainty, however, some residents found comfort in the abiding beauty of the Big Island.

Authorities also ordered an evacuation of Lanipuna Gardens, a smaller, more rural subision directly to the east   In this photo released by U.S. Geological Survey, ash plume rises above the Puu Oo crater, on Hawaii\u0027s Kilaueaa Volcano Thursday, May 3, 2018 in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park\u0027There is quite a bit of magma in the system. It won\u0027t be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved. And so we are watching that very, very closely,\u0027 Miklius said.After a week of earthquakes, authorities had warned residents to be prepared to evacuate because an eruption would give little warning.Henry Calio said the first sign that something might be wrong happened when cracks emerged in the driveway of his home in Leilani Estates. His wife, Stella, then received a call from an official who told them to get out immediately. They feared they might lose the house.\u0027This is our retirement dream,\u0027 Henry Calio said.  Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.

The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.The magma later crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point. Authorities closed the area to visitors and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.Over the decades, most of Kilauea\u0027s activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky and killed one person.A 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet (457 meters) into the sky. Since then, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles of land and destroyed many homes.

We met when we were 18, and she is still in the same townhouse off Mill Hill Broadway she lived in then. Her daughter was taken home there after she was born. Her mum still lives round the corner, and she sees her every day.Last time I stayed with her, we reminisced about seeing the first Star Wars when it opened on Leicester Square in 1977.I told her daughter, now 21, that her mum hasn’t changed a bit. Her hair is the same. Her mannerisms. Her face. But, most importantly, her house."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/02/4BE643A900000578-0-image-a-23_1525569571366.jpg","title":"Dog appears frozen stiff vets examination table","story":"    In a clip shared by Arizona native Joshua Snelling, his dog can be seen completely frozen on a examination table          \u0027This is my dog at the vet, this is what he does... he\u0027s scared as hell,\u0027 Snelling can be heard saying in the video          Snelling, a railway engineer based out Phoenix, says that it\u0027s the \u0027weirdest thing\u0027 while his dog appears frozen in motion"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/01/4BD7D11400000578-5695503-Outside_London_the_picture_was_worse_with_disastrous_performance-m-4_1525567421425.jpg","title":"Now no doubt Corbyn got prayer says LORD BLUNKETT","story":"      Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party missed an opportunity to seize key Conservative-held London boroughsCertainly they will never have a better opportunity. The internal Tory civil war over Brexit, the Windrush scandal and the breast-screening fiasco all resonate deeply in the capital. But even in London – now, more than ever, a Labour city – the Corbyn revolution is the dog that refused to bark.The party I have worked for all my life catastrophically failed to win targets such as Barnet, where voters, at least in part, turned away from Labour in droves because of the anti-Semitism furore. Outside London the picture was worse, with disastrous performances in Dudley, Derby and elsewhere. Election expert Professor Sir John Curtice pointed out there had actually been a swing to the Conservatives from Labour.Yet according to the leadership’s advance publicity, this was an election in which the Corbyn-supporting Momentum group was supposed to deliver grassroots campaigning and a seismic political breakthrough. How telling that one of Labour’s few success stories, in Plymouth, happened precisely because local activists insisted on running their own campaign and told Momentum to stay away.The lesson to be learned is simple and obvious: Corbyn’s project is leading the party away from victory.            Outside London the picture was worse, with disastrous performances in Dudley, Derby and elsewhereLabour moderates have remained dutifully silent since he unexpectedly won more than 40 per cent of the vote in last year’s General Election. But it’s becoming clear that Theresa May was denied the mandate she sought for a whole host of reasons, not because Corbyn is some sort of modern prophet.Last June some voted for Labour safe in the belief that Corbyn would not be Prime Minister, others because they believed it was their best chance of avoiding a hard Brexit. There were, certainly, some true believers. But it has become increasingly clear that Jeremy’s leadership is going nowhere.Where, for example, is his vision? He could have cauterised the damaging anti-Semitism scandal by exposing it for what it was: the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader, and expelling those responsible. Instead he has fudged and prevaricated.His policy on the most pressing matter of the day, Brexit, is so vague that even the Shadow Ministers press-ganged to explain it on television and radio tie themselves in knots.And the parliamentary successes Labour has enjoyed in recent months have come because of the hard work and political nous of politicians the Corbynistas hatefully profess to despise as ‘Red Tories’ – backbencher David Lammy shaming the Government over Windrush Margaret Hodge forcing the Government into a U-turn on Commonwealth tax havens Yvette Cooper holding Amber Rudd’s feet to the fire over the ‘hostile environment’ for immigrants, which resulted in her resignation. Keir Starmer and his team are the only reason Labour’s Brexit balancing act has lasted so long.We currently stand at a crossroads in British history, where if Tory hard-Brexit free marketeers have their way, workers’ protections could be shredded, countless jobs lost.This is precisely the moment where the Labour Party should be leading the national debate about our future, but all Corbyn and his acolyte John McDonnell have to offer are ideas that were promoted and rejected in the 1970s and 1980s. I’m not opposed to their ideas of social ownership of water and joint partnerships in rail. But these are not the policies of tomorrow. What does Corbyn’s Labour say to the millions who stand to lose their livelihoods to automation and outsourcing? How will it rejuvenate hollowed-out towns where shops are boarded up? What will it do about our deteriorating public spaces, where shared events and experiences should be enriching all our lives?What, after all, is the point of Labour as a party of principle if it doesn’t make a stand for the people it is elected to represent rather than peddle outmoded political dogma?I was part of a Labour ‘project’ that won three General Elections by appealing to people’s aspirations for a better future, not a return to the past. The lesson then, as now, is Labour can only be politically successful if it creates a clear agenda based on a positive alternative, rather than defining ourselves as being ‘anti’ everybody and everything.The parliamentary party – backbenchers, committee members and Select Committee chairmen – must pick up the cudgel and begin formulating ideas and policies. From among them, a leadership group must be formed from which a genuine alternative can emerge.It won’t be easy. I’ve seen the personal vitriol local activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from the likes of Unite’s Len McCluskey. I’ve seen how good Labour MPs are traduced and insulted, and admired the bravery of those who have been vilified for standing up to anti-Semitism.But it’s clear from the council election results that Corbynism is doomed to failure. Rebuilding a new, positive, Labour from the ground up is the only way forward. It’ll take time, which means there’s no time to lose.Whatever your views on Labour, our country and our democracy needs a proper, credible and electable alternative to challenge the Government. A renewed form of moderate New Labour needs to return.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/02/4BE615F300000578-0-image-m-19_1525568658997.jpg","title":"Photo series shows profiles men Tinder Bumble Happn sunsets backdrops","story":"The project explores human desire, self-perception, and the murky world of data-based love.In it, Middleton is asking the crucial question that bubbles under the surface of today\u0027s cyber-driven relationships: how much does a photo tell us? Who is this person, \u0027the swiped\u0027, who we see as nothing more than a beaming man with a setting sun?\u0027While using the widest search settings possible (on Tinder it was 100 miles max distance, age 18-55+, men) to browse through endless images of men, I noticed a formula for attraction, the most endearing trope of them all, the sunset,\u0027 Middleton told DailyMail.com.\u0027Each guy offered their own version of the same iconic sun. The relationship between the inidual, the sun, and how the two came together to attract the viewer, fascinated me. The project physicalized my overall feeling within today\u0027s culture of dating.\u0027Almost 50 million Americans have used online datings sites or apps, according to a recent survey by eHarmony.Of those, Pew Research found 66 per cent have gone on dates with people they met virtually - a huge leap up from 43 per cent in 2005.However, 33 per cent - approximately 16.5 million - go no further than swiping, messaging, and ultimately sidelining their matches.There are clear caveats. Even now that online dating is so ubiquitous and socially accepted, the chances of bagging a successful relationship remain slim - just 13 per cent of Tinder couples survive a month together.    For women, harassment is another deterrent to following through on a date: 57 per cent of women feel harassed online, including 39 per cent of Tinder users and 38 per cent of OkCupid users. But those factors aren\u0027t slowing down the industry\u0027s resounding boom which is rapidly transforming modern relationships.Taking stock of this dating revolution, Middleton was interested in the way the millions of singles used each app\u0027s strict visual format to sum themselves up.\u0027I\u0027m obsessed with the ways we represent ourselves to others,\u0027 Middleton explained.\u0027How do we curate the digital and physical world around us to represent a body others might desire? How do our choices create behaviors, both inidual and collective, that impact our everyday relations?\u0027Technological platforms, such as Tinder, Bumble, and Happn, offer a sensuality that lacks physicality. The desired body exists on the other end of a screen we touch. We feed ourselves the fantasy of partnering body in a warm sunset as we finger a flat surface and eat a bag of cheetos. Our body takes in an entirely separate reality from our mind and the disconnection causes a split of self.\u0027I believe this splitting has a micro affect on how we relate to each other in the physical world as the space for seeing and being seen has extended beyond our body\u0027s physicality and enabled new potentials for self-performance.\u0027I make work that questions this strange new relationship we have with ourselves and with others.\u0027  \u0027The video \u0027Guys with Sunsets\u0027 is the only interaction I have with these men,\u0027 Middleton said. \u0027It exemplifies the broken relationships we have with each other through our daily digital experiences.\u0027\u0027In the exhibition, a video is displayed in a small space that asks you to lie down and insert only your head. I wanted to cause a gesture that physically separates the head from the body, mentally taking you out of the world around you and into the one I have created for you.\u0027The installation emulates the experience of entering the connected world of our phones, while the sensations of our body in physical space pause and become a literal surface for those around us.\u0027The exhibition took place in the Tribeca neighborhood in Manhattan, New York, on March 24. In a choreography of images, set to Nina Simone\u0027s Either Way I Lose, Middleton playfully remarks on her personal feelings in the digital world of attraction.\u0027Searching for something real in an image-based system can be exhausting,\u0027 Middleton says.\u0027Mostly because our definition of real is continuously in flux.  People who visited the exhibition had to participate with the installation by laying down and sticking only their head in a small room (right) as the video played on loop  The installation (right) purposely detached participants from their body to emulate the artist\u0027s feeling of disconnection as she swiped for love with her body behind the confines of a screen\u0027As a member of this developing visual culture I find myself in a constant state of foreign and familiar. Both feelings happen simultaneously as I find difficulty in identifying the difference between the digital and physical worlds. \u0027The two worlds migrate closer to one another, within one another, on top of each other. Soon the sensation of difference will be gone and the rules of performance anew.\u0027Apps presented a new physicality of human desire. A longing funneled into a digital dating game. Their algorithms have presented a new data-based method for understanding relations and offer a distance between both the swiper and the swiped that turns another human into nothing more than an image of an idea.

Those are the facts that we’re still working on,\u0027 Giuliani said. \u0027And that -- you know, may be in a little bit of dispute. This is more rumor than it is anything else.\u0027The facts of the matter are under dispute in no small part because of Giuliani\u0027s claims last week about what Trump knew and when he knew it.Trump personally distanced himself from his lawyer\u0027s statements on Friday, claiming that Giuliani had only just come aboard and was operating without all of the relevant information. Hours later, Giuliani released a statement recasting the entire incident. Giuliani said in a Saturday evening appearance on Fox News that his star client ‘says he still loves me’ even though he inadvertently put him in legal jeopardy with a claim that the payment was made with the 2016 election in mind.He attempted to use that interview, and the one on ABC this morning, to narrow his role to the special counsel investigation into alleged collusion and obstruction of justice. Giuliani on Saturday caled called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the Mueller investigation into alleged collusion with Russia.He also slammed the Justice Department for what he perceives as giving Hillary Clinton preferential treatment during her investigation - unlike Trump and his associates. The statements by Giuliani this week contradicted longstanding positions of Trump and the White House, who have claimed for weeks that the president had no knowledge of the payment.

Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, says she was paid $130,000 by Trump to keep quiet over their alleged affair during the presidential campaignGiuliani said the President was surprised when he learned what the money had been used for and approved Giuliani\u0027s decision to go public with the reimbursement, which he did while speaking to Sean Hannity on Fox News on Wednesday night.\u0027You\u0027re not going to see daylight between the president and me,\u0027 he told NBC. \u0027We\u0027re going to work hard to have a consistent strategy.\u0027Trump may now be vulnerable to criminal liability over undisclosed payments as well as possible violations of campaign finance laws.When asked if Trump was angry with him, Giuliani told The Washington Post on Friday: ‘He says he loves me.’Giuliani and Trump continue to have a strong relationship.It has been reported in the Post that the two men are still coordinating their legal strategy as Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation continues apace.Trump and Giuliani are planning strategy without bothering to consult or inform members of the White House communications team, the Post reported. Meanwhile, it was reported on Saturday that Trump knew about Cohen\u0027s hush money payment to Daniels several months before he denied any knowledge of it in April, according to two people familiar with the arrangement.          Michael Cohen, Trump\u0027s long-term private attorney, is being investigated for fraud and campaign finance breaches over the alleged payment to Daniels, it is understood          Mueller\u0027s team is understood to have raised the prospect of forcing Trump to answer questions in the Russia probe, though it is unclear how serious the threat wasThe insiders told The New York Times they were unsure exactly when Trump learned about the money transfer - intended to stop Daniels discussing their alleged affair - but he knew about it by the time he made his denial in April.Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, signed a nondisclosure agreement with Cohen several days before the presidential election. The porn star has now sued to have it made invalid because Trump never signed it himself. The lawsuit has now spiraled into questions about whether the payment made to secure Daniels\u0027 silence violated campaign laws, as could be the case if the money was sent with Trump\u0027s knowledge or to benefit his run for president.If this was the case then it should have been declared, according to legal experts. Cohen has insisted he paid the money out of his own pocket without the then candidate\u0027s knowledge. Trump, meanwhile, has denied the affair and insisted the agreement was organized by Cohen to prevent embarrassment to his family, not to help his presidential bid.Asked why Cohen had made the payment on Air Force One in April, he replied: \u0027You\u0027ll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen is my attorney. You\u0027ll have to ask Michael.\u0027Giuliani on Friday said he is preparing for the possibility that Mueller will subpoena President Trump as part of the ongoing Russia probe.Giuliani said he believes there is roughly a 5050 chance that a subpoena will be issued, telling ABC News \u0027I got to prepare for that 50 per cent.\u0027  Rudy Giuliani insists Trump wasn\u0027t aware of Stormy Daniels reimbursement until recentlyGiuliani tries to clarify comments on Trump¿s reimbursement of payment to porn star Stormy Daniels - The Washington Post"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/10/4BE87E3500000578-0-image-m-7_1525598828725.jpg","title":"Tory MP accuses Corbyns spin chief Seumas Milne peddling Russian propaganda","story":"    A Tory MP launched a savage attack on Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s top aide Seumas Milne (left) today and accused him of peddling Russian propagandaThe incendiary claims against Mr Corbyn\u0027s communications dircetor were made in today\u0027s Sunday Times.Mr Seely said: \u0027I am concerned about the writings of Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s communications director Seumas Milne  and how they have appeared to dovetail uncomfortably closely with Russia\u0027s agenda in Ukraine.\u0027 The Isle of Wight MP said four articles by Mr Milne made the same \u0027broad argument\u0027 about Russia\u0027s case for federalism in Ukraine.He said leaks from the Kremlin laid bare that this was the foundation of Russian mischief in Ukraine.Theresa May vows she WILL take Britain out of the EU customs...Wet wipes will be \u0027eliminated\u0027 in Britain under ministers\u0027...Share this articleAnd vowing to challenge Mr Corbyn in Parliament on his aide\u0027s activity, Mr Seely said: \u0027Based on what Milne has written, I am concerned that he appears to be, at the very least, a fellow traveller of an authoritarian regime intent on invading other countries.\u0027The question is not whether Milne was sympathetic to the Kremlin\u0027s agenda but whether he was  wittingly or not  a fellow traveller or an active agent of influence for the Kremlin.\u0027I ask the question in the public interest.\u0027           Bob Seely said writing by Seumas Milne during his career as a Guardian columnist had chilling echoes of Kremlin misinformationA Labour source dismissed the reports.They told MailOnline: \u0027The claim by Conservative MP Bob Seely that Seumas Milne is an \u0027\u0027agent of influence\u0027\u0027 is an absurd and baseless political smear.\u0027Mr Milne has repeatedly criticised the Russian government, describing Putin\u0027s justifications for intervention in Ukraine as \u0027\u0027legally and politically flaky\u0027\u0027 and argued that Putin\u0027s \u0027\u0027authoritarian conservatism\u0027\u0027 offers \u0027\u0027little for Russia\u0027s future\u0027\u0027.\u0027Western governments have also backed greater regional autonomy in Ukraine to help end the conflict, so Bob Seeley\u0027s suggestion that this is somehow sinister is utterly ridiculous.\u0027Conservatives MPs should instead explain why Putin\u0027s government supported the Conservative Party in last year\u0027s UK general election, with the embassy in London even promoting May\u0027s \u0027\u0027strong and stable\u0027\u0027 slogan.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/16/4BE85D1B00000578-0-image-a-105_1525619423466.jpg","title":"Octagonal weather observatory built Quakers 150 years ago 600 000","story":"    The incredible octagonal building was built by Quakers 150 years ago and has gone on the market for offers over £600,000          The four-floor tower is split over several levels and features a striking spiral staircase which snakes its way through the entire building          From the fourth-floor of the tower there are striking views out over Falmouth harbour and the Cornish countryside beyondIt was built in 1868 by the Royal Polytechnic Society, founded by Anna-Maria and Caroline Fox, Quakers who were concerned about the well-being of the working classes.The tower was constructed to provide weather information to the local population and serve as a way to engage them in meteorology.It only served this purpose for 12 years until 1880 when another observatory was built elsewhere in the town. It was then used for storing meteorological records and artists and school groups visited until it was turned into a private residence in the 1980s.The current owners bought it in 2004 and transformed it from the basic accommodation it had been over just the bottom two floors, into the stunning five-storey property it is now.It has 1,216 sq ft of accommodation with two bedrooms and two bathrooms on the ground and first floor and the kitchendiner and lounge on the second and third floors to take advantage of the views.On the fourth floor is the observation deck, which the estate agents describe as \u0027one of the most incredible rooms anywhere in Cornwall\u0027.          On the ground floor of the building there is a useful wet room with modern appliances, shower, loo, sink and modern tiling          There is also a camera obscura in the observatory deck, effectively turning the room into a pinhole camera and projecting the beautiful panoramic views onto a table          The comfortable lounge one floor below the observatory deck affords the inhabitants ample living space and yet more sumptuous viewsIt has windows on all eight walls offering a genuine 360-degree view across Falmouth, the surrounding countryside and coastline, including Falmouth Bay, and across to the Roseland Peninsula, with St Mawes and Pendennis Castles easily seen and lit at night.The room has an oak panelled vaulted roof space leading up to the camera obscura at the apex, which was constructed in the 1950s.It converts the whole room into a pinhole camera when the black-out blinds are drawn and it rotates, allowing the panoramic views to be projected as an image on a table in the observation deck.The owners have recently run the property as a holiday rental and are prepared to sell it with ongoing bookings and its website if the buyer wanted to continue this.All the furniture, linen, cutlery and crockery, light fittings, blinds and artwork are available by separate negotiation.Ian Lillicrap from Lillicrap Chilcott said: \u0027I\u0027ve been an estate agent in Cornwall for 39 years and I can honestly say it\u0027s the most unusual property I have ever dealt with.          The house also features a light and bright compact kitchen with 360 degree windows offering light from every angle around          The house only features two bedrooms in total but they are modern and bright throughout - with the house having been recently renovated          The house\u0027s floorplan shows the unusual layout in more detail - as it is split over five floors but only offers around 113 square meters in living space\u0027And the views from the upper floors and the top are the most spectacular I have ever seen.\u0027It\u0027s like being in a helicopter above Falmouth when you reach the top. It just completely takes your breath away.\u0027It\u0027s glazed on all sides so you get a 360-degree view over Falmouth and for miles surrounding.\u0027It is the sort of vista you just never see.\u0027It\u0027s a well-worn phrase but it truly is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\u0027The craftmanship in this property is spectacular. The beautiful, quality, intricate workmanship and ingenuity, similar to kitting out a superyacht, has been brought into this building.\u0027The flooring, the winding staircases from floor to floor and the way the kitchen has been fitted, it\u0027s all marvellous. The owners have the most incredible eye for detail.\u0027It\u0027s not huge so I don\u0027t think it will sell as a main home but it would be an absolutely prized second home for someone or it could be someone who wants to use it for lettings.\u0027I don\u0027t believe there is anything else resembling it in Cornwall.

The weekend I pasted floral-sprigged Laura Ashley wallpaper upside down.My first love lived in Brixton. My first grown-up dinner party was in Brixton. I’ve just remembered that I once woke to find someone had tried to jemmy open the front windows, and I was once hit about the head at the bus stop opposite Brixton Police Station. But even crime fails to stem my ardour.After the window incident, my late brother turned up unbidden, and slept every night on the floor to keep me and my sister safe.Or maybe I should travel even further back, before I left for London, and make sure I stayed firmly in the town where I was born: Chelmsford in Essex.My dad was born in a nearby village called Terling.

That ancient quince tree, whose fruit my mum turned into jam, is not only still alive, it has exploded into blossom!So the news last week that at least a million fewer people moved house between 2001 and 2011 compared with 1971 to 1981 is heartening. The change might be due to lack of social mobility and housing, or soaring stamp duty rather than not wanting to leave the location of your first kiss, but as someone who has moved house 14 times, that can only be a good thing.Like millions of baby-boomers I was seduced by TV shows such as Location, Location, Location (I actually hired Phil Spencer to find my farm in Somerset) and Grand Designs, and like many ambitious Londoners I thought moving to the country would be a breeze: just like staying in Babington House, but with no checkout time.But moving away from not just friends but the familiar – the florist that did your wedding and your mum’s funeral, the local art-house cinema where you snogged your future husband, even the basement kitchen where you found out he was cheating – is scary.Your past, like a tent caught in a gale, is ripped from its moorings, and disappears. Like many people, I moved house thinking, Ooh, once I’m there, in that dreamy location – I study new houses on Rightmove for hours, Google Earthing them, taking imaginary walks from the door and working out where my furniture will go – I will be happy.It never happens, because you take yourself with you.The most sorted person I know is my best friend. We met when we were 18, and she is still in the same townhouse off Mill Hill Broadway she lived in then. Her daughter was taken home there after she was born. Her mum still lives round the corner, and she sees her every day.Last time I stayed with her, we reminisced about seeing the first Star Wars when it opened on Leicester Square in 1977.I told her daughter, now 21, that her mum hasn’t changed a bit.

Andy Perry is believed to be the first Brit to lose an entire leg from a spider bite, after he almost died when the creature sank its fangs into his ankleAfter numerous appointments with specialists Andy opted for an elective amputation above his right knee, which was carried out in March.He has now been left wheel-chair bound, unable to work or play with his children and needs daily treatment.Andy, of Huncote, Leicestershire, who lives with his police officer wife Christine, 39, said: \u0027I was doing a quote for a job in 2015 and I was coming home at lunchtime to look after the kids because my wife was on shift.\u0027But within a couple of hours I started feeling really poorly. I rang the missus to see if she could come home but she couldn\u0027t and the next I know I got a massive ache in the small of my back.\u0027That was pretty much me done then and Christine came back home when I called her again.          Mr Perry\u0027s leg is pictured three weeks before the amputation. He said the pain was so severe he considered sawing it off \u0027I went to bed when she got back, pretty much for the whole weekend and I was throwing up.\u0027Then on the Sunday morning it was a question of having to get over to the hospital as soon as I could.\u0027I was seen by a doctor in the Royal Leicester Infirmary Triage and he said there was no chance of me going home.\u0027Then he admitted me straight away, the ache in my back was the kidney\u0027s packing up from the infection and sepsis. I put on a IV anti-biotic and almost died because of the sepsis.\u0027US surgeons could save this little girl\u0027s leg... so why did...Woman, 26, has her right leg AMPUTATED after suffering a...Share this articleExperts believed the false widow spider was to blame after daily blood test when a phlebotomist noticed two puncture marks on Andy\u0027s ankle.The doctor in charge deemed the bite to be from the false widow spider - as its bite has similar effects that Andy was experiencing.\u0027It was the phlebotomist who did my daily blood test - he spotted these little puncture marks on my ankle,\u0027 he added.\u0027He said it looks like a spider bite, they then got the doctor in charge to have look and that\u0027s what they came to agreement on.          Mr Perry\u0027s leg is pictured following the amputation he was forced to undergo when the spider bit his ankle \u0027They came to a conclusion it was a false widow spider because it has a reputation of biting people.\u0027The puncture marks were just above the sock line because I used to wear socks and boots.\u0027The only thing we can think of is that I literally just brushed past it and its had a quick bite as I\u0027ve gone past.\u0027Apparently the bite of the false widow feels like a bee sting but I didn\u0027t feel a thing. The spiders are an awful lot more common than people think.\u0027After they sorted out the kidney function, things started improving and the sepsis was beaten by the anti-biotics.          Mr Perry (pictured before the bite with his son Tom) is believed to be the first Brit to have a leg amputated due to a false widow bite\u0027I\u0027ve had the district nurses coming around for the next three months changing the dressing on my leg every day.\u0027The lymphedema caused the leg to swell to the point where the skin split and fell off.\u0027That was all just a massive open weeping sores and blisters and just generally horribleness.\u0027And that was it, the leg was all but useless from that point, I spent a certain amount of time trying to get treatment.\u0027There just wasn\u0027t a surgeon nearby who wanted to touch it because of the lymphedema as it was a live infection.\u0027So without getting any treatment I just couldn\u0027t work - so I figured I would go down the route of elective amputation in a last desperate attempt to get back to work.          Andy had no idea he had been bitten by Britain\u0027s most venomous spider until he was rushed to hospital suffering from sepsis and kidney failure\u0027But again trying to find a doctor or surgeon to look at the amputation was hard.\u0027Eventually I had to threaten my GP with cutting my own leg off with a blade from a chainsaw because I was getting so desperate.\u0027Out of that I tried a guy in Coventry who climbed on board straight away as soon as he saw the leg.\u0027I spent 20 minutes talking to him, needed a second opinion and spoke to prosthetic people and as soon as that was done it was all agreed.\u0027The leg was cut of on March 13 of this year, it should\u0027ve been healed by now but I got a secondary infection so I was back in surgery on April 27.\u0027I\u0027ve now got a vacuum dressing on me which pulls all of the gulp out of the leg and takes it away.          The father-of-two has spoken of his horror after he fell seriously ill after being bitten by a false widow spider\u0027The plan is to rehabilitate the leg, get a prosthetic and get back to work for this year or next.\u0027I had been a landscaper for about five years prior to the bite and I had a good business going on but now its all gone.\u0027We\u0027ve been living off my wife\u0027s salary - I have got zero income because of this bite.\u0027Andy is now hoping to get help to fix up his garden so he can play with his children Thomas, 8, and George, 5.He added: \u0027They\u0027ve been brilliant, they\u0027ve taken it in their stride, we have explained every single thing about whats happened all the way along. I can\u0027t use the garden, I\u0027m just complete and utterly stuck\u0027I\u0027ve been looking for help with my new project which is sorting out his garden to make it more wheelchair friendly.          Mr Perry was rushed to hospital suffering from sepsis and kidney failure and had to have his leg amputated \u0027I\u0027ve now realised that our garden is horribly unsuitable for my wheelchair.. My chair is great but it doesn\u0027t like grass.\u0027It is a small garden and it\u0027s laid mostly to lawn and soft landscaping but there is a large raised deck that I installed to overcome the slopes in the garden.\u0027I can barely get outside let alone use the deck so I\u0027m restricted to an area of 1.5 square metre.\u0027I\u0027ve contacted lots of builders yards in the hopes of securing donations of materials. I can\u0027t afford to buy the items which I think will cost around £4,500.\u0027I know it is a long shot but I\u0027m hoping to raise donations of materials and then I\u0027m hoping to find friends and tradesmen willing to help out by doing the work, a kind of Ground Force, DIY SOS thing, on a local basis.\u0027I just need to get a prosthetic but we don\u0027t think that will be this year - I had promised the boys to take them trick or treating at Halloween but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a possibility now.\u0027The UK has seen a rise in false widow spiders - dubbed Britain\u0027s most venomous spider - in the past four years, believed to be caused by an increase in climate.The influx of the eight-legged beasts has seen a number of unsuspecting Brits hospitalised.The false widow spider is not deadly, but can deliver a similar bite to its antipodean cousin, which can kill within hours.Instead of the venomous black widow spider, which dons devilish black and red markings across its body, the false widow spider in Britain is usually harmless.The Steatoda nobilis is native to Madeira and the Canary islands, and is believed to have arrived on British shores via a cargo transporter in the 19th Century. Andy\u0027s Justgiving page is here. Crowdfunding to Buy an electric wheelchair on JustGiving"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/14/4BBB5ED000000578-0-image-a-82_1525179717175.jpg","title":"Pictured Karen Matthews sports new hairstyle revealed sponging sugar daddy","story":"New photos have revealed Eric Anderson (pictured right) the 72-year-old sugar daddy of Karen Matthews (pictured left)Revealed: British tourist who dressed up as \u0027Britain\u0027s worst...Karen Matthews \u0027scams the homeless by selling them DONATED...Share this article    Matthews is believed to be with Mr Anderson in a Pret A Manger store in this picture from 2017Matthews, who claims to be a devout Christian since finding God while in prison, now works in a charity shop alongside Mr Anderson, who denied giving her money.However, the 43-year-old is thought to have fibre optic broadband and a slew of flat screen TVs in her state-funded flat, funded by the pensioner.   He has also ­allegedly been putting money in Matthews\u0027 pockets ever since she was released from prison in 2012. Although the pensioner declined to comment on whether their relationship involves any financial agreement, he did admit to giving her support and teaching her about love.           Eric Anderson, pictured, is thought to be a devout Christian and works with the evil Matthews in a charity shopThe shamed scrounger served four years for arranging the kidnap of her daughter Shannon who was aged just nine at the time. Sources close to Matthews claim she\u0027s been on the hunt for a sugar daddy since coming home from prison in 2012. She is alleged to have set up multiple accounts online seeking financial arrangements with men.

The black circles – obliterating the entire face of a farmer in North Dakota, the right eye of a woman in Arkansas, or resembling an eclipsed sun hanging in the sky over labourers in Maryland – were created when the negatives were censored in the 1930s by clipping them with a metal punch.Many of the 175,000 photographs in the Farm Security Association archive became defining images of the Great Depression, including Evans’s gaunt sharecropper families, Lange’s portraits of farm women with nothing left except willpower, and Arthur Rothstein’s Fleeing a Dust Storm, a surreal scene of a family fighting to keep their feet in the wind that has already ripped their farm buildings to shreds.However, thousands more images were censored, judged not to meet the strict criteria the photographers had been given for the type of images sought – a tricky brief to show the scale of the problem the association was trying to tackle, but without obliterating all hope. The negatives were mutilated – occasionally several holes were punched to prevent the image being used even in cropped form – but not completely destroyed. The censored and approved images all ended up archived in the Library of Congress, where they have recently been digitised. Nayia Yiakoumaki, the curator of Killed Negatives, spent weeks poring over thumbnail images to choose the 80 photographs in the exhibition. “They were so wonderful,” she said. “It was an almost impossible task, there were thousands I could have used.“I was astonished when I learned of the existence of the rejected negatives. These are photographers and images that I have studied and taught, but I had not realised that the images we know so well were only part of a much larger story.”The images all date from a pioneering project by the FSA, which in the 1930s sent photographers out into fields, homesteads, villages and small towns across America to record the farming communities being ground down by the Great Depression and the efforts being made by the FSA to help them.Although the images often appear as spontaneous photojournalism, the photographers were actually working to a very tight brief, and were given detailed information in advance about their subjects. The briefing note recorded that Steve Doty, of Tangipahoa Parish, whose mule had died and who received a temporary loan for fertiliser for his strawberry crop, had “built a one-room log hut for his family to live in. The cracks have been stuffed with newspapers. Two of his children are in school and the two youngest ones are at home.” A widow and eight children were left destitute when a man died of cerebral cancer after months getting lifts as a charity case for hospital treatment. The youngest child was under three, and 15-year-old Angelina had been left totally blind by typhoid. The 17-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, was the only one able to work, “being able to sew and do canning work very well”. In many cases the contrast between the immaculately turned out people and the shabby surroundings shows clearly that the photographer’s visit was expected and prepared for, but any images that looked too staged were rejected, as were those showing FSA officials.All the photographers sent back their rolls of film to the project director, Roy Stryker, an economist but a photographer himself, who had the approved images printed in his laboratories. Yiakoumaki can see why some images, slightly out of focus, poorly composed or showing the photographer reflected in a window, were rejected – but she can only guess at others. Did the striking black couple photographed by Walker Evans in New York look too smart, confident and urban? Was the group dancing in a circle, described by the photographer Carl Mydans as “healthy children in clean backyard”, just too healthy and too white? And the same photographer’s pair of black children, sitting in a litter-strewn yard in front of a decaying shack, “such is the front yard available to these two youngsters to play in”, too desperate and too black?“These photographs stand as beautiful images in their own right,” Yiakoumaki said, “but the intervention, the very act of destruction has made them into something more, objects which can be seen as works of contemporary art.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d966ef48d35f574967779e6bf05fbcb0b51ca9c5/0_353_4603_2762/master/4603.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bdc73c3aa91e26ddbbf7377b57fb4f3","title":"three hundred years of false teeth in pictures","story":"A new exhibition at the Wellcome Collection covers the past 300 years of dentistry: from blacksmiths removing rotten teeth with pliers, and dentures made with teeth stolen from corpses or – for the very wealthy – out of walrus ivory, to the pure white Hollywood smiles of Cary Grant and Shirley Temple.

The journey of the Saltwater people of the Gold Coast as documented by photographer David Kelly and narrated by Ben Allmon by Ben Allmon and David KellySeventy kilometres, three days, two canoes, one unforgettable adventure. The journey of the Saltwater people of the Gold Coast as documented by photographer David Kelly and narrated by Ben Allmon by Ben Allmon and David Kelly“A land bridge connected Minjerribah (Stradbroke Island) to Kombumerri country (Southport) and Goories also came in canoes to Minjerribah trading bunya for eugarie, amongst other things.” – History Life and Times of Robert Anderson, Gheebelum, Ngugi, MulgumpinReading this four years ago, I realised I knew nothing of the Indigenous history of my home on the Gold Coast – the land of the Saltwater people. I felt a responsibility to my young son to learn the story of the place we live, so that when he grew up I could teach it to him.But who was going to teach me? So I embarked on a voyage of discovery that carried me further than I ever expected, into a cultural story that is rarely offered to outsiders. What started as an attempt to educate myself became something far bigger – The Saltwater Story.Anderson’s account gave me an idea – why not make canoes and re-establish these ancient routes of connection? The Bundjalung, Yugambeh and Quandamooka were accomplished seafarers with complex maritime routes plied by bark and dugout canoe (gundal) – the former for short trips, the latter for longer voyages like the one described in Anderson’s book. The bark canoe in particular illustrates how to sustainably take what you need from your environment – the bark is removed but the tree remains alive and over time new bark grows. Very few still possess this knowledge – thanks to veteran paddler Mark Matthews I met Bundjalung canoemaker Kyle Slabb, who does. We quickly realised that this was more than just an opportunity for a whitefella to engage and educate himself – it was a chance to ensure cultural continuity in the next generation of Saltwater people. We decided to document the experience in a film, a book and an exhibit of David’s amazing photographs. As it happens, there was a suitable bark canoe tree in my backyard but the year was too dry to make a viable gundal. Nevertheless, Kyle’s demonstration of the crafting techniques to the younger generation was invaluable. We then made dugouts from hoop pine and paulownia the latter wood repels seawater, which prevents it from becoming waterlogged. Even when the temperature rose to 45 degrees, the young mob were interested in chipping in with (and away at) the canoe.We departed from the middle of Surfers Paradise on Australia Day weekend, surrounded by huge modern vessels and glittering towers. Maori, Dragonboaters and the general boating community joined us on the first leg in a wonderful flotilla – a celebration of all maritime histories in this country.Over the next three days and 70km through shark-infested waters we watched the young men grow into their roles, assume the mantle of leadership for the voyage. When we reached Dunwich (Goompi), a lot of the Quandamooka welcomed us. It was an emotional experience for many, especially as Robert Anderson himself, 88, was the elder who welcomed the paddlers … and with whom we exchanged bunya for eugarie. It had been 150 years since this journey had been made. There is talk now all along the Sea Eagle songline of canoe making, of connecting through the canoe over the saltwater again.So what will I tell my son? A story of connection – between the Saltwater people, between generations, between black and white, between land, sea and sky. A story of collaboration – whether it is made from bark or dugout, no one makes a canoe alone.A story of co-operation – paddlers working together to get to their destination, through rough seas and shark-infested waters.A story of continuance – of ancient knowledge held by just a few, of ensuring that tomorrow’s elders are brought along for the journey today. That is the Saltwater stories"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7c266d14e2297b0c07fc37fde6de25f2f5a313d/0_588_7284_4371/master/7284.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be37a347e693bbb3ed2ac30dcf3a043c","title":"may bank holiday sun heats up sales of paddling pools and garden gnomes","story":"Stores pack shelves for boom in sales of ice-cream, rosé wine, BBQ staples and garden ornamentsRetailers and garden centres have enjoyed a much-needed boost from what is set to be the hottest early May bank holiday on record, packing the shelves with ice-cream, barbecue food, paddling pools and plants as shoppers got their first real taste of summer.Sainsbury’s said: “This scorcher of a bank holiday is set to be the first proper barbecue weekend of the year. We’re predicting that our ice-cream, gin and Taste of Summer barbecue staples will be real sizzlers – not to mention suncream flying off the shelves as we all head outdoors to soak up the rays.”DIY retailer B\u0026ampQ said that each of its flagship stores is likely to sell well over 100 barbecues, 3,000 bags of compost, 6,000 bedding plants, 150 mowers and 125 fence panels over the weekend.“At this time of year especially, customers do respond to the weather. We tend to see a change in the type of projects they do,” said Steve Guy, B\u0026ampQ’s market director for outdoor. We look at the weather forecast for the next 14 days and make trading and stock decisions on a daily basis.”“It’s no surprise that herbs are the must-have plant of the season they’re fragrant, look great and are the perfect addition to summer BBQs for both drinks and dining,” said Lilidh Matthews, herb buyer at Wyevale Garden Centres. “They also thrive in small spaces, and are an increasingly popular addition for city balconies and kitchen windowsills alike.” Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, said garden and DIY-related goods were likely to fare well because it was the first opportunity for keen gardeners to get out planting and tidying-up after weeks of poor weather.“Anything related to the garden is likely to do well after such a poor Easter. People will use the opportunity to get out and do work in the garden and in the home. And of course fashion should benefit as people will want to replenish their wardrobe as the first signs of spring and summer emerge.”Well-stocked smaller convenience stores were expected to be among the bank holiday winners, according to analysts at research firm Kantar Worldpanel.“Whenever the mercury rises people swiftly move away from traditional meals and start focusing on the barbecue,” said Fraser McKevitt, Kantar’s head of retail and consumer insight. “In the interests of maximising their exposure to the sunshine consumers are also much more likely to shop locally rather than travel longer distances to bigger stores, so the retailers who’ve stocked up on sausages and burgers in their convenience outlets should perform well this weekend.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba933f6e47e93b4d9a2a7ee42517d4a6","title":"against such a shambolic government labour should be doing better than this","story":"Stalemate is a result which a prime minister at midterm can live with. Tories have been left feeling more cheerful than they deserve to beOne way of assessing who has done best at a midterm election is by computing vote shares and measuring swings. If we do politics by calculator, then the local elections were pretty much a dead heat. Both Labour and the Tories enjoyed gains they could trumpet both suffered losses they’d prefer not to talk about. Like First World War armies, they have fired their shot and shell, only to end up in a trench warfare stalemate. Labour can pray in aid the projections that this result, translated into a general election, would make the party the largest in a hung parliament. Tories can retort that that’s worse than Ed Miliband managed when these council seats were contested in 2014. The projection then had him in Downing Street with a majority. So much for projections.If you want to know how the parties really feel about how they performed, forget the swings, the shares and the misleading extrapolations. Get out of the psephologists’ playground and use your ears to measure the frequency and quality of the excuses coming out of the spinners and spokespeople. In that regard, Labour has been on the back foot since the polls closed it is Jeremy Corbyn’s team that talks like the deflated party.In the early hours of Friday morning, at a time when all but political nerds have put themselves to bed, I watched Dawn Butler, a member of the shadow cabinet, trying to put a brave face on disappointment by saying: “We always knew it was going to be a difficult election.” This is normally the alibi you hear rolled out by a government minister explaining why midterm elections nearly always go badly for whoever is in power at Westminster. You do not anticipate hearing the defensive “always knew it was going to be a difficult election” excuse from a senior spokesperson for the principal party of opposition.Still less do you expect to hear it from the main challenger to the government, when the incumbents have fouled up so atrociously in the run-up to polling day and have been in office for a long and torrid stretch. The Conservatives are entering their ninth year in power. Economic growth is anaemic and many people are still not seeing real increases in their wages. Public services, especially many local services, have been pinched by the protracted grip of austerity. Mrs May has just lost another cabinet minister, the fourth forced departure from her top table in six months. From the national picture to the local one, from the shameful Windrush scandal to the record number of potholes breaking wheels and bones on the roads, the Tories went into these elections facing strong headwinds. They thought that they’d be the ones having to scrabble\u0026nbsparound for the excuses on election night. The Tories were on the ropes and flinching before an expected thumping by Labour that didn’t materialise. Some say that Labour has got the rough end of the stick in the post-election assessments because the party was poor at playing “the expectations game”. Anticipation of what could be achieved became overblown, with the consequence that a reasonable result would then be interpreted as failure.There may be some truth to this when we examine what happened in London. Labour had a result there that confirms its dominance in the capital, but it was not quite powerful enough to knock the Tories out of control in Kensington \u0026amp Chelsea, Wandsworth or Westminster. You can say that Labour lost the expectations game or you can be a bit less polite and observe that the party’s leadership and its admirers have been guilty of hubris. They went on about seizing the “Tory crown jewels” in the capital because they really thought there was a chance this was going to happen. They have so taken it for granted that Britain is inexorably embracing Corbynism that it has come as a bit of a shock to find that many voters still have the gravest reservations about giving their support to Labour even when the main alternative is Mrs May’s party.In some places, Labour was punished for specifics. The failure to deal with antisemitism in the party’s ranks clearly hurt the party and badly in Barnet, where it failed to win a part of north London it should have taken. Jeremy Corbyn’s broader problem is the same one he had at the election last year. Under him, the party does extremely well in large urban conurbations. One of Labour’s advances was to deprive the Tories of control in Trafford in Greater Manchester.Labour also has increased support by historic standards among more affluent professionals. It is one of life’s ironies that Mr Corbyn has made Labour a more middle-class party than Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson managed to do. We also know that Labour is popular among younger generations. It may be that Labour’s performance at the locals was somewhat suppressed compared with a general election because younger voters are less likely to turn out for council elections. Where Labour made insufficient progress at the general election, and continues to struggle, is beyond the big cities and university towns. The party is doing particularly badly among older and less affluent voters in provincial England. It underperformed in areas such as Basildon, Bolton, Derby, Dudley, Nuneaton, Swindon and Walsall. These are places with key parliamentary constituencies where the opposition has to be winning well at this stage of the electoral cycle to look credible as a government-in-waiting.One Labour alibi for this is to blame the implosion of Ukip, which has become the “Black Death” party in the estimation of its own general secretary. For every three former Ukip voters, two went to the Conservatives and just one to Labour. It seems to me that Labour has been a bit too ready to accept this as inevitable, rather than to ask itself why it can’t appeal to more of these voters. That boosted the Conservatives as they enjoyed the bigger helping from the carrion of Ukip. But this feast contains a poison pill. Because a large chunk of Tory support was provided by Leave voters, the hard Brexiters have been emboldened to clamour for more concessions to their demands. The price of catering to that constituency is that it will further alienate the Tories from the younger and more liberal voters that they will need to attract if they are ever to assemble a decent parliamentary majority.Forward-thinking Tories will also be worried that the Lib Dems are flickering back to life. The gains made by Vince Cable’s party will lift morale and encourage them to think they can rebuild the traditional base in local government that was devastated during the coalition years. As importantly, the evisceration of Ukip re-establishes the Lib Dems as the third party in England, which ought to give a boost to their presence in the media. They will be helped by voters being reminded of their existence more regularly. Experience suggests that a Lib-Dem revival will hurt the Conservatives in parliamentary contests more than it damages Labour. That is for the future. Theresa May, a prime minister who measures success by whether she gets to the end of the week, is simply glad that she avoided a Tory meltdown. For her, survival is a kind of triumph.Local elections are a highly imperfect guide to general election success or failure, the more so when the next national contest could be as much as four years away. That said, we should not make the opposite mistake of pronouncing that they are entirely meaningless. The voters are always telling us something about the present and a bit about the future when they cast a ballot. On these results, there is no clear path to a parliamentary majority for either of the big parties. The Labour MP Jess Phillips got it right when she drolly observed: “I see everyone is claiming failure as victory.”Failure is always relative in politics. Stalemate is a result that a government at midterm can live with. Tories have been left feeling more cheerful than they deserve to be and more optimistic about their prospects than they have been for a while. A draw is not good enough for the main opposition party. “We should have romped home,” remarks one senior Labour MP. More of them would be saying that publicly if they did not feel intimidated into silence. Against a shambolic and ided government presiding over a weak economy, Labour has not put in the level of performance necessary to make it look like an opposition party striding confidently towards national victory.Deep down, at least some of Labour’s leadership know this. Just listen to the excuses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b6bcd2e1d83535d0974c1560e36f3bcd6371997/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cf4433fd69131d2a60cbb46c86d1d9b","title":"even when the likes of macron foul up multilingual politicians get it right","story":"The French president, Emmanuel Macron, never ceases to surprise his audience, especially when he speaks in English. While some of his compatriots were shocked that he should address the US Congress in its native tongue, it pleased a large number of French people who appreciated how he engaged directly in version originale.A few days later, however, when President Macron thanked the Australian prime minister’s wife, Lucy Turnbull, for being “delicious” – conjuring up images of cannibalism and Hannibal Lecter – some commentators suddenly thought of Macron as creepy. It was hours before somebody thought to tell the Australians that the word “délicieuse” actually means delightful.Speaking a foreign language is a minefield for anyone who ventures there but also a source of constant wonder, joy and fun. The rewards are manifold and it is even thought to prevent Alzheimer’s disease.The smartest leaders either know many languages or understand the power of words enough to play with them to their advantage. Perhaps Macron used the word “delicious” on\u0026nbsppurpose perhaps, even, the secret behind the strangely warm rapport between Macron, Trump and their wives is built on such deliciously faux amis?The fact is that multilinguists rule the world. That Angela Merkel is trilingual (she speaks German, Russian and English) should be no surprise. If David Cameron had not been a monoglot, maybe Britain would not have found itself in a Brexit nightmare. Just a thought.I will always remember when Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, on a visit to Paris in 1989 declared in French on French television that the PLO’s charter was “caduque!” What a stroke of genius. The world reached for their French dictionaries and discovered Arafat had just buried the 1964 Palestinian charter (since “caduque” means out of date), which had so far insisted that armed struggle was the only possible way to win back the homeland. This tiny word paved the way to the Oslo accords of 1993 and the famous handshake between Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin in Washington.In 1940, Parisians owed a big favour to Louisa Gross née Horwitz, the mother of the then American ambassador to Paris, William Christian Bullitt Jr. A German Jew, she made sure that her son was perfectly trilingual, as fluent in German and French as in American English. When the French government fled Paris, in effect making Bullitt the provisional governor of the city, there were only a few hours left to save the city from the fate shared by Rotterdam and Warsaw. Bullitt managed to persuade two French officials to meet their German counterparts at Écouen, 12 miles north of Paris, to settle terms for the handover. With the document signed, the German Field Marshal Georg von Küchler called off the bombardment of Paris.In everyday life, multilingualism and potential linguistic gaffes don’t carry such catastrophic potency, and faux amis leading to faux pas are part of the learning process. When I first arrived in Britain, aged 22, I found out that, more often than not, French words in the English language don’t actually mean a thing. I recall an awkward evening when an Englishman whispered some slightly salacious things to me. He winked and apologised for the “double entendre”. Double entendre? It took me some time to realise he meant “sous-entendre” – meaning implication.It is, however, always better to make small mistakes like Macron did in Australia than to rely on poor translators. The writer Oliver Kamm, the son of one of the greatest living British translators Anthea Bell, reminded me this week that in 1977, the translator Steven Seymour, accompanying Jimmy Carter on an official state visit to Poland, had to be fired after a disastrous first evening. President Carter had begun his speech saying: “I have come to learn your opinions and understand your desires for the future.” His translator told the Poles, in Polish: “I\u0026nbsphave a carnal desire for Poland.”• Agnès Poirier is the author of Left Bank, Arts, Passion and the Rebirth of Paris 1940-1950"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33901bcc4f0c1f1cc4bade7d525d1314534d8a01/0_0_1906_1430/master/1906.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d999b7c9adeb752d3e47f1bb4d89b1d 700w","title":"nick offerman interview parks and recreation","story":"Best known for his role in the US sitcom, the actor talks about his love of tools, being a Londonphile, and his proposal to Megan MullallyNick Offerman is best known for his portrayal of libertarian local government worker Ron Swanson in the US sitcom Parks and Recreation.

There was a touch of Little House on the Prairie. My earliest memories are of my dad splitting firewood. As soon as we could swing an axe, he’d have me and my siblings out there. It was a carnival of tool use – gardening, repairing barns, maintaining machinery. I always looked up to my two uncles, who reminded me of Han Solo.

It’s charismatic to be self-sufficient, to be able to mend our own bicycles. For decades, we’ve been taught to be sheep-like consumers. “The handle’s fallen off the toaster. Let’s throw it away and get a new one.” That’s not frugal living nor respectful of the planet’s resources. Using tools makes you a good citizen.You’re soon co-hosting a new NBC show with Amy Poehler. Tell us about it.It’s a crafting contest called Making It, starting in July. Crafters of all different disciplines compete in challenges to make things, while Amy and I clown around, tossing out as many painful puns as we can muster. I’m thrilled with . It’s good-hearted and optimistic, the sort of medicine the world could use right now. After you’ve spent the day shaking your fist at your Twitter feed or grinding your teeth at the political situation, you can switch on Making It. The comfort food of television.Sounds a bit like The Great British Bake Off…Funnily enough, that was one of our influences. The Bake Off’s warmth, camaraderie and joy in creativity was really inspiring to us.Amy Poehler was one of your Parks and Recreation co-stars. Do you stay in touch with the others?The whole cast just got together for a reunion dinner, which was wonderful. We still have a group text thread, which started when we were shooting and has never stopped. It’s like a great sports team or your college years, whatever your glory days were. In some ways, you’ll always miss it, but with maturity, you realise it can’t last for ever. We’re grateful we got to experience it for seven years but it came to a natural end and wrapped up at the right time.Devoted carnivore Ron Swanson became a hero for meat lovers. Do people assume that’s the real you?There are several areas in which people conflate me with Ron’s cartoon physicality. Sometimes in a restaurant, if the chef is a fan and hears I’m dining, they’ll add an inch-thick layer of bacon or send over an extra steak. At first, it was amazing. Who doesn’t love free meat? But my cardiologist pointed out that a real digestive system can’t eat like that. Or indeed drink scotch in Ron’s quantities and hope to lead a productive life.You’ve slimmed down in recent years anyway, right?I have. My Parks and Rec boss asked me to “stay beefy”, which is one of the best things you can hear from your employer. But as the show ended, the parts coming my way fell into a similar trope: “An ex-sportsman, 30lb past his prime, standing in his briefs, crying in the mirror.” I decided I’d like to live as long as possible and get a wider variety of roles, so I cleaned up my diet and trimmed down. Maybe now I’ll be cast as a thinner version of that depressed, gone-to-seed sportsman.Do you miss Ron’s trademark moustache?I love having a healthy faceful of whiskers. Facial hair is a boon for a character actor. In any given year, I can sport a full prospector’s beard, all the way down to clean-shaven. It’s another tool in my thespianic toolbox, as it were.You’re quite a Londonphile, aren’t you?London is our favourite city on the planet. Much like Fortnum \u0026amp Mason’s Beef Extract spread, it’s simply moreish.

Magically, the ducks on the water and birds in the air began to furiously copulate all around us. Something made the moment bigger than the two of us. It was fated by Mother Nature.Haven’t you and Megan co-written a marriage guide too?It’s called The Greatest Love Story Ever Told, out this fall. It’s a sincere memoir of our romance, but, as always, shot through with humour and lots of filthy references to what we do in the bedroom. Eighteen years into the relationship, I’m constantly grateful she continues tolerating me. When I wake up and look over at her, I still think: “You lucky bastard, you better be on your best behaviour today.”What else is in the pipeline?I have a film coming out in June called Hearts Beat Loud. It has a crackerjack cast and it’s the beautiful, touching, funny story of me and my daughter’s little rock band in Brooklyn. I’m proud of it. I’m hoping it will expand my repertoire to bearded man in briefs, holding a Les Paul custom guitar and crying in the mirror. • The Tool Book with a foreword by Nick Offerman is published by Dorling Kindersley (£20).

On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city – the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau – or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival it’s the world’s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers.In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa’s central Rideau canal. The world’s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that’s a pastry, not an animal’s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children’s Snowflake Kingdom.Thanks to it’s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada’s topography.The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada’s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Château Laurier, the historic “castle”, opened as a grand hotel in 1912. Parliament’s central Peace Tower is perfect for a bird’s-eye panorama of the city visit on Wednesdays at noon in summer for free yoga sessions in front of parliament on the lawn. Keep your eyes peeled: you might just see prime minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau joining in.There’s a vibrant restaurant scene in Ottowa. Explore the eclectic cuisine of Canadian Culinary Champion Marc Lepine, the only chef to win the Gold Medal Plates competition twice, at his restaurant Atelier or the innovative Middle Eastern fare of Walid El-Tawel at Fairouz.City neighbourhoods are equally exciting and eminently walkable. ByWard Market is arguably the most vibrant, with more than 120 places to eat and drink in a four-block-by-four-block patch that’s also home to a great selection of shops. Also try Westboro and the Glebe, where you’ll find Lansdowne, a complex with a year-round farmers’ market and a new stadium where you can catch sports events downtown. Ottawa’s museum and gallery scene reflects Canadians’ past and future hopes. Gatineau’s Canadian Museum of History’s Grand Hall with its towering totem poles captures the lasting presence of indigenous cultures, while the museum’s new Canadian History Hall presents the largest and most comprehensive exhibition about Canadian history ever created. In contrast, quirky Bytown Museum reveals the history of Ottawa . Here you can discover the military raison d’être of the Rideau canal – a Unesco world heritage site – as you learn about its construction after the British colony’s war of 1812 with the US.

It is this latter quality, initially seen by many as a good thing, that has become an acute concern for safety campaigners, who fear that the rising number of electric vehicles constitutes a silent menace.When they travel at under 20mph the vehicles can barely be heard, especially by cyclists or pedestrians listening to music through headphones. “The greatest risks associated with electric vehicles are when they are travelling at low speeds, such as in urban areas with lower limits, as the noise from tyres and the road surface, and aerodynamic noise, are minimal at those speeds,” said Kevin Clinton, from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents.But the days of silence are numbered. From July next year, all new electric and hybrid vehicles sold in Europe will have to emit a noise when travelling at low speeds. All existing ones will have to be retrofitted with a device by 2021.The law has been welcomed by campaigners. James White, at the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, is worried about the risk the cars pose to people with sight loss. He said that for people who struggle to see them, the vehicles should indicate their presence in other ways.In Japan there was a national outcry when a guide dog and its owner were killed by a reversing electric vehicle whose driver had used a pause control to deactivate its sound emitter. The new standards, which in Europe will be introduced via an EU directive, will bar their use.About 140,000 electric vehicles are now registered in Britain compared with just 3,500 in 2013. By 2030 the National Grid predicts there could be as many as 9 million electric vehicles on Britain’s roads.Chris Hanson-Abbott, whose firm Brigade Electronics is a distributor of vehicle safety products, is an adviser to the UN working group on quiet road transport vehicles that came up with the industry standards now being introduced across the world as electric cars become mainstream. “The object is to have warnings which are audible but which are not the least bit environmentally disturbing,” said Hanson-Abbott, who introduced the reversing alarm to the UK in 1976.Battles have raged over what sort of sound the vehicles should emit and when they should emit it, Hanson-Abbott said. The agreed standard is a mix of tonal sounds, or white noise, that will cut out once the vehicle gets to about 20mph and the sound of the tyres becomes sufficiently audible. “White sound is very pleasant. It’s the sound of falling water,” Hanson-Abbott said. “It has two unique characteristics. One is that it’s very pleasant on the ear and the second is that the source direction of that sound is instantly recognisable. The moment you hear white sound you can point directly at where it’s coming from. This is an incredibly valuable quality.”In contrast, “tonal” sound emitted by diesel or petrol cars can bounce off hard surfaces, making it difficult to judge its source. “It’s a huge improvement on the noise emitted by petrol or diesel vehicles because its sound source is directional,” Hanson-Abbott said. “That’s a massive safety factor.”Politicians promoting electric cars as the future of urban transportation have welcomed the move to make the vehicles noisier.“It’s something manufacturers are already looking into and we understand from previous tests that the main risk is lower-speed driving – such as reversing when manoeuvring around a car park – when the car is most quiet,” said Sally Longford, who is in charge of neighbourhood services and local transport at Nottingham city council. It wants to support the use of 8,000 more electric vehicles in the city by 2020.“We are fully supportive of calls for manufacturers to look at how this can be addressed to ensure the increasing number of electric vehicles on our roads doesn’t create an unnecessary risk to pedestrians and other road users,” she added.Number of electric cars in UK, up from 3,500 in 2013.Predicted number of electric cars on UK roads by 2030.Date all electric cars in EU must fit a noise emitter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75d1ebc99fa0eebca93e813c70e372bbed6766ed/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1151eff6e6dc8953792193dfa402650","title":"lean on pete review andrew haigh modern american odyssey charlie plummer","story":"British director Andrew Haigh’s modern American odyssey sees Charlie Plummer excel as a teen fleeing grim realitiesA performance of remarkable depth, candour and vulnerability by rising star Charlie Plummer lies at the heart of this terrifically moving fourth feature film from British writer-director Andrew Haigh. Adapted from the 2010 novel by Willy Vlautin, Lean on Pete blends timeless American myths with pin-point portrayals of modern urban hardship, as its lonely teenage lead heads east from Oregon with a horse on its last hurrah. The travails are tough but there’s an unsentimental tenderness at the centre of Haigh’s movie – a melancholic counterpoint to the grim realities of life from which our young hero flees.Plummer plays Charley Thompson, a lanky 15-year-old (he lies about his age) who has moved home umpteen times with his single father, Ray (Travis Fimmel). With dreams of playing for the high-school football team blighted by a nomadic lifestyle, Charley has become a loner who has learned to fend for himself. Running past the Portland Meadows racetrack, he meets Steve Buscemi’s trainer, Del Montgomery, who offers him a few bucks to change a tyre and help with his horses. “Never let go of the rope,” Del tells Charley an instruction that seems to double as a diehard life lesson.A diffident yet attentive presence, Charley has a trusting nature and finds a kindred spirit in the eponymous quarter horse, a former short-sprint winner (“Don’t blink or you’ll miss it”). The endearingly named Lean on Pete is showing signs of age, and Del is getting ready to send him, euphemistically, “to Mexico”. “You can’t get attached to a horse,” says Bonnie (Chloë Sevigny), a jockey who has suffered her fair share of injuries, and who observes tellingly that “there’s only so many times you can fall down, right?” But when all hope seems lost, Charlie hits the trail with his one true friend, heading for Wyoming and searching for somewhere to call home.Vlautin’s novel has been described by critics as a distant descendant of Walter Farley’s The Black Stallion, with shades of Salinger and Steinbeck. There is a quote from the latter at the start of the novel that Haigh has clearly taken to heart. “It is true that we are weak and sick and ugly and quarrelsome,” Steinbeck wrote, “but if that is all we ever were, we would millenniums ago have disappeared from the face of the Earth.” Haigh paints sympathetic portraits of all the characters the good, the bad and the ugly. Ray may not be an ideal father, but there’s a tangible tenderness in the scenes with his son, and a sense of closeness that persists even during his frequent absences. Del is a world-weary chancer who dopes, exploits and then dumps his horses, yet there’s a gruff paternal affection in his advice to Charley to “do something else before there’s nothing else you can do”. Even Steve Zahn’s drunken drifter Silver has a child-like quality that is counterposed with a violent tinderbox temper.After the tight focus of Weekend and 45 Years (which the director described as “companion piece” pictures), Haigh widens his canvas as Charley heads into the desert, embarking upon an American odyssey to which Danish cinematographer Magnus Nordenhof Jønck responds with lyrical grandeur. While the narrative may be read as a coming-of-age story, there’s something more elemental in Charley’s search for a beloved aunt, who comes to represent his idealised yearning for a lost family life. Crucially, Charley remains at the centre of the picture, with the oblong 1.85 frame lending a human dimension to these expansive vistas, ensuring that we don’t get distracted by the scenery, or lose sight of the true focus of the story.Unsurprisingly, Lean on Pete is a film in which gestures are more important than words. Having declared in passing that “You won’t see me again in California”, Del shoots Charley a glance that speaks volumes about his shady past. As for Charley, he may have been schooled in Sam Shepard-style manly “truths” (“The best women have all been waitresses at some point,” Ray tells him between beers), but his voice has a lilting softness, which matches the expressiveness of his face. At times, there’s a touch of James Dean in Plummer’s plaintive delivery, along with echoes of Jon Voight’s marooned hustler in Midnight Cowboy. Having made a splash in Felix Thompson’s 2015 indie-pic King Jack, Plummer has proved a mercurial presence in films as erse as Oren Moverman’s The Dinner andmore recently Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World. In Lean on Pete, this rising star proves his mettle in a role for which he is simply perfect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c2cd7da24e914d22d02826c46fe41f5501337ab/0_302_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ab2a0c40b577ace11a125d4f9163525","title":"cardiff city promoted to premier league draw reading","story":"It was carnival time in the Welsh capital as Cardiff City celebrated their return to the Premier League on a day that felt like a triumph for Neil Warnock as much as for the club he has revived.This is Warnock’s eighth promotion – a record that sees him eclipse the achievements of Jim Smith, Dave Bassett and the late Graham Taylor – and completes an astonishing turnaround since he took over as manager only 19 months ago, when Cardiff were second from bottom.The goal the home supporters craved failed to materialise but in the end it did not matter, courtesy of Fulham’s defeat at Birmingham, which meant Cardiff were promoted irrespective of the scoreline here. Those goals at St Andrew’s were greeted with huge cheers, no more so than when Birmingham scored a third in the 89th minute to put to bed any lingering fears Fulham could somehow spoil the Cardiff party.A premature pitch invasion followed before the real thing, which ended up with every blade of grass covered by thousands and thousands of Cardiff supporters, who spilled over the hoardings to salute their heroes. Amid a sea of blue shirts, bathed in glorious sunshine, Warnock’s name reverberated loud and clear as the Cardiff fans paid tribute to the man who has galvanised their club and put together a team who are far greater than the sum of their parts.This is the fourth occasion he has won promotion to the top flight, following the success he enjoyed as a manager with Notts County, Sheffield United and Queens Park Rangers across three decades, and Warnock described it as “the biggest achievement in my 38-year career by an absolute mile”.Vincent Tan, Cardiff’s owner, was there to see everything unfold and to join in raucous celebrations that continued long after the final whistle. Appointing Warnock is arguably the best decision Tan has made at Cardiff and it promises to be a colourful experience with the two of them working in tandem in the Premier League.With Cardiff’s direct and uncompromising style, Warnock talked about how he has “built a team capable of ruffling a few feathers” in the Championship and made it clear he plans to do exactly the same next season. “That’s all we can do. It’s not rocket science when you take the top six out of it in the Premier League. We’ll be odds-on favourites to get relegated. But we were 33‑1 this year to get in the play-offs, let alone win promotion. So we’re going to enjoy it. At my age you can’t help but do that.”Warnock turns 70 in December and one school of thought would be that now would be a good time to call it a day and go out in style, yet he was totally dismissive when the word retirement was mentioned. “Oh no, not at all. I think I’ve got to stay here for the club. I saw a story this morning that Vincent might be selling. You just don’t know.“But as quickly as the club has developed, it could go the other way, make no mistake. And I’m not going to let it go the other way after what I’ve done. So whatever happens, I’m determined to see it through.”The Premier League has not been particularly kind to Warnock. He was relegated with Sheffield United on the final day in 2007 and sacked midway through the season with Crystal Palace and QPR, yet he sounded totally relaxed about what the future holds for him with Cardiff next season and, in what felt like an important message, vowed to only sign players prepared to buy into his way of working.“I don’t like losing four or five games on the trot and then all the experts will come out next year and tell me where I’m going wrong. But if it goes pear-shaped, I’ll just leave. So there’s nothing to worry about really,” Warnock said. “But I’m really looking forward to it. I don’t think we should worry about it too much. We’ve got the basis. We’ll have to buy five or six players to supplement the squad but it’s good to have different styles.Although the game itself was largely forgettable – Reading were never really at risk of losing their Championship status – Cardiff’s journey back to the top flight after a four-year absence will live long in the memory of their supporters and the manager who has written his name into the record books. “I know we’re going to get one or two things thrown at us next season,” Warnock said. “But, hey ho, it’s better than playing in the Championship, isn’t it?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/856e1236bc84d6657c9fe1fcb2eef3e2335b364b/0_222_4296_2577/master/4296.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db2419e82c7f81255cef8e8ee66a39e0","title":"manchester city huddersfield premier league match report","story":"After Manchester City tweeted in support of Sir Alex Ferguson on Saturday the mood here was celebratory from start to finish as the coronation of Pep Guardiola’s champions should be – though the pitch invasion at the close featured two City fans holding a large banner saying: “Football aside get well Fergie.”City had walked out to a guard-of-honour made up from survivors of the 1968 title-winning team in an Etihad Stadium turned blue-and-white by flags placed on seats.The visitors began as so many do here: watching a medley of passes from Kevin De Bruyne, Leroy Sané, Kyle Walker, Fernandinho and David Silva flash before them. The latter had the opening chance as he broke behind Huddersfield Town lines and aimed a low shot at Jonas Lössi, the goalkeeper making the save.David Wagner’s side offered an near-instant response via Aaron Mooy, though his effort required Ederson only to watch it. The German’s tactic was to box City in when the ball was with their Brazilian goalkeeper. So it was that with players surrounding the area Ederson misplaced one clearance straight to Mooy, the No1 perhaps feeling more pressurised that usual at this venue.This caused a shake of Guardiola’s head and there was more from Mooy. The Australian found Steve Mounié with a clever inside-out ball that had City’s rear-guard scrambling.Before this Sane had rolled the ball into De Bruyne but the Belgian’s measured left-foot shot went wide. Later Sane again broke through and failed to find Sterling. The pattern continued when Gabriel Jesus failed to finish a De Bruyne cross from near in.It all had Guardiola glum-faced as he watched on. Mooy, though, was having a fine half: his next touch was to find Chris Lowe with a no-look pass, the No 15 receiving the ball close to Lossi’s goal but, from a narrow angle, he snatched at the opportunity.Alex Pritchard had gone far closer when forcing Ederson into a flying save to his right, tipping the ball around the post for a corner and, as the second half started, his team remained on level terms.Guardiola had selected as close to his strongest available side, bringing in John Stones and David Silva for Aymeric Laporte and Ilkay Gundogan from the 4-1 win at West Ham.Wagner’s two changes were the standing down of Rajiv van La Parra and Collin Quaner for Mathias Jørgensen and Pritchard with his team still requiring a win from their last three games to ensure survival.If Guardiola put a flea in his charges’ ears at half-time a slipshod Walker pass that ceded possession will have particularly annoyed. Still, with Huddersfield now attacking towards their supporters the sight of Ederson confidently taking a high ball will have cheered his manager.City went close in a goal-line scramble that had the ball parried on to Mounié and scrambled away by Christopher Schindler. Huddersfield’s first-half exertions began to tell. They became more encamped in and around their area as City pressed for a win that would take them to a record 96 points.For the closing period Guardiola took off Stones for Bernardo Silva, switching to a back three, but victory proved elusive. For Huddersfield this a credible and invaluable point in the fight to beat the drop.And, for Vincent Kompany, after final whistle there was another proud moment. The Belgian, not in the match-day squad, finally lifted the Premier League trophy – a third time he has done so for the club."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74c685d4ba79a2d47040d4fee434de000495ebc4/0_224_1842_1105/master/1842.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bdc85ba0c0eb90add00b85d8ee1871d","title":"chelsea v liverpool premier league live","story":"82 min: Firmino is caught in possession on the halfway line but, as he often does, he wins the ball back off Fabregas as though offended. Liverpool build and Henderson bends a ball into the box that Rudiger stretches to head up and away. And then Henderson repeats the trick, trying to find Firmino on the far post, but Azpilicueta sweeps at the ball, mis-kicks and puffs his cheeks out in relief after watching the ball bobble harmlessly into Courtois’s arms. He was tad lucky there, all right.80 min: Then Chelsea break and Moses curls a delicious ball in to the back post, where Alonso bends backwards and thumps a left-footed volley inches wide of the far post. That would have been a sublime goal. It was behind him and difficult to control.78 min: Liverpool are going for this. Alexander-Arnold pings a ball in to Solanke’s feet. The youngster is under pressure but does well to hold the ball near the penalty spot. He’s desperate to turn and shoot at goal but the ball is prodded away by Cahill near. Mane picks up the loose ball and looks to shoot but the blue Chelsea wall moves out squashes the space expertly. The pressure is building though.76 min: Azpilicueta stops a dangerous-looking Liverpool attack with a wonderfully-timed sliding interception just outside the penalty area. He’s such a steady player.74 min: Robertson is taken off. Solanke is brought on. Klopp is going to go for this point. Milner is either playing rock–paper–scissors as he gets instructions off Klopp or he’s instructing the team that they’re playing 3-4-2-1. I think that’s what his hands said, anyway. 71 min: Salah tries to dance around a crowd of Chelsea players in the box. He almost succeeds but is finally forced to cut back inside where he tries to play a one-two with Firmino, but the Brazilian’s back-heel is stabbed away. Chelsea break but their counter-attack fizzles out in the final third.70 min: Arsenal are winning 4-0 now. They’re definitely better than Burnley. 68 min: This is all going wrong for Liverpool. Their passing has gone to pot and they’re looking disjointed now too. Robertson chests a ball towards Karius that is nowhere near the keeper and drifts out for a corner. Karius probably could have come out and helped the Scottish full-back out, mind.66 min: Moses shows fleet of foot on the right as he tries to engineer an opportunity to cross but Robertson does well to hold him up and Liverpool clear. Liverpool break and Henderson finds Firmino on the right. The Brazilian swivels inside his marker and clips a cross into the box where a sum total of zero Liverpool players are waiting for the ball.65 min: Salah has been quiet today but he has been quiet in other Liverpool games and then scored. He’s had only 22 touches in the game so far.64 min: Salah lurks menacingly on the edge of the box and flicks the ball towards Mane but Rudiger gets a boot on the ball and sends it high into the air. It’s not pretty but Chelsea clear eventually.62 min: Hazard plays a one-two with Bakayoko and beats Alexander-Arnold for pace down the left with a jet-heeled burst of acceleration. He can’t find a cross but the ball is worked back to Bakoyoko on the edge of the box but his shot is good old-fashioned daisy-cutter that slows down as it rolls across the dry pitch. 60 min: Henderson is on for Clyne. The full-back has looked a little rusty today. Alexander-Arnold will now play at right-back and Henderson can sit in midfield. 57 min: Hazard leads Firmino and Clyne on a merry dance down the left, leaving both looking flummoxed in his wake before walloping a shot at Karius that loops up and is cleared hurriedly at the back post by Robertson for a corner. From that, Giroud wins a header and Rudiger clatters the ball past Karius but he’s a mile offside. 55 min: Kante puts paid to another Liverpool attack, skidaddling into the path of Robertson and shepherding the ball out of play for a goal-kick after Milner had prodded the ball down the left wing.53 min: Liverpool win a couple of free-kicks around the penalty area that are defended well by Chelsea. The home side then break forward rapidly and force Robertson to clear at Liverpool’s far post. Chelsea look better balanced now. They’re much better in the transitions than in the first half.51 min: Hazard is enjoying himself now. He plays a rabona pass for no reason at all. I doubt he’d have done that early in the first half when Chelsea weren’t in the game.49 min: Alexander-Arnold takes a look at goal, thinks about laying the ball off and then thinks better of that and goes for the Roy of the Rovers approach. Thwack! It’s miles over. Nothing wrong with a bit of chutzpah from a youngster, though. 47 min: Hazard wriggles away from his marker on the left wing and finds Fabregas inside him. The midfielder spins away from his marker and then momentarily loses control before taking an extra touch and freeing Moses on the right-hand side of the box. But the winger’s shot at goal is drilled a foot wide. That was nifty play. 45 min: Peep! So, can Liverpool get the point they need to secure Champions League football next season. Salah has an early whiff of goal but his hot from 10 yards is scuffed under pressure.“Would Arsenal now be in the Uefa Cup final if they hadn’t moved Giroud on?”  asks William Hargreaves. Erm, I doubt it. One man alone cannot hold up a crumbling house. Arsenal are winning Wenger’s final Gunners home game 2-0 by the way, so they’ll probably finish above Burnley. Whoop!Joseph Harvey talks tactics: “As a Liverpool fan who has watched every Chelsea-Liverpool match the past couple of years, Conte has a really good plan against Liverpool. Basically, it’s let Liverpool have most of the ball, counter when you can. Towards the end of the last match, Conte threw on Fabregas and Willian and basically bossed the game. Liverpool were lucky to get out with a draw. Sure, Liverpool look dominant, but barring something special, this is probably the best way to play against Liverpool. Mind you, it doesn’t help to have Spurs fans on your side.”Maybe this is all part of a Klopp motivational masterplan. “By the way lads, you need to beat Real Madrid to do this all over again next season!”Chelsea hold out and Klopp has some thinking to do at half-time. For large parts of the first half Liverpool looked the better team but some nice wing-play from Moses and a trademark Giroud header have given the home team a lead that may keep their top-four hopes alive. Back shortly.45 min: The half is drawing to a close with an extended spell of sterile possession from Liverpool. The blue wall in front of them appears to have very few cracks in it.44 min: Rudiger does well to hold off Salah and wallop the ball out for a throw. They were team-mates at Roma last year. Rudiger has certainly read Salah well and has looked solid against the turbo-charged Egyptian so far this afternoon. Like with much of football I suspect the answer lies in dressing-room b@ntz. 40 min: Clyne is booked for clattering into Alonso over by the touchline. Fabregas swings the resulting free-kick towards the back post but Karius catches confidently under pressure. 38 min: Liverpool are back in possession and comfortable once more. They work the ball back up to to Salah, who dinks the ball across the D looking to make space for a shot and then tumbles under a challenge that was never really there. He’s correctly booked for a e. 35 min: Ah, what a goal can do for confidence. Fabregas wriggles away from Robertson and fires what appeared to be a shot across Karius and out for a goal-kick. In fact, maybe it was a cross. It was a mighty tight angle. 33 min: Before that goal Chelsea did set an alarm bell ringing when Bakayoko headed wide from a Moses cross. Well, this makes the game, and maybe the last game of the season, very interesting.Well, that was against the run of play but Chelsea won’t care. Moses scoops a cross in towards the near-post and Giroud nips in front of Lovren to glance a header across goal into the far corner. He legs it away to celebrate with David Luiz on the Chelsea bench.30 min: Mane has two half-chances again, first walloping one at goal from 25 yards that Courtois parries away and then picking up a loose ball with a wonderful turn before stabbing straight at Courtois from the penalty spot from 12 yards. 29 min: There are shadows cast on to the Stamford Bridge turf by the late-afternoon sun. However, this hasn’t happened yet. 27 min: Liverpool are pressing high up the pitch and Chelsea cannot get out of their own half with any ease. Conte is rubbing his head. It’s safe to say he’s not happy with what he’s watching. Liverpool, for all their endeavour, have not had a clear-cut chance yet though.26 min: Milner is hobbling in midfield. They have Henderson on the bench but beyond him their midfield backup consists of some 12-year-olds, Tinhead from Brookside and one of the Crankies. 24 min: Mane rifles a low shot at goal that Courtois parries. It was reasonably central though so the keeper was expected to save it. Still, it was hit with thunderous force. From the resulting corner Courtois gets the slightest of touches on the ball to take it away from Van Dijk’s head. It was a free header into an open goal had the keeper not got something on it. Liverpool are still very much bossing this game.21 min: Clyne crosses low after some dazzling footwork from Salah on the right but the ball is behind Mane, and the forward wallops a right-footed attempt into nearby Putney. 20 min: Shaun Wilkinson writes: “Do you think Klopp calling this ‘a semi-final’ was an attempt at some kind of Jedi mind trick? Liverpool haven’t won the league in nearly 30 years, but have won a ton of cups in that time. Does he think the way to finally win the league is to hypnotise his players into believing every league game is actually a cup game?” Maybe Derren Brown will be brought in to the coaching setup to replace Buvac.18 min: Kante shows his value in midfield by tracking Mane half the length of the pitch before sliding in to halt a Liverpool counter-attack. Mane did dawdle on the ball somewhat after an unnecessary stepover though.17 min: Alonso stings Karius’s palms from 20 yards with a sweetly struck shot. This is better from Chelsea. The chance came after Alexander-Arnold got caught out of position after trying to cover for Clyne.15 min: Moses cuts the ball back on the right in Chelsea’s first proper attack. With the chance to fire at goal from the penalty spot both Bakayoko and Giroud get in each other’s way. Giroud is furious. Liverpool break but nothing comes of the counter-attack.13 min: Chelsea just can’t get going. They’ve been sloppy in possession when they reached Liverpool’s half. You would think Chelsea had been the team who had played in an energy-sapping semi-final in midweek, not Liverpool. Giroud is caught late by Clyne. He lets out a huge shriek as the Liverpool full-back’s studs land on the top of his foot. That could have been a booking too. Giroud’s OK though.10 min: Firmino breaks clear and tries to release Salah behind the Chelsea defence but his pass is either underhit or holds up on the turf. Another dry pitch? Klopp would love that. And then Milner clatters into Hazard and is lucky to escape a booking. He slid right through him late there.8 min: Clyne and Alexander-Arnold trade passes on the right and the youngster whips a ball in to the back post but it’s too deep. Chelsea are playing like a team who need a point here. They need a win. They seem very happy for Liverpool to have the ball. Late smash-and-grab tactics?6 min: Chelsea just can’t get into this game at the moment. Liverpool look extremely comfortable in possession. Taking their time as they move forwards. Chelsea are very compact though. Space isn’t easy to find when Liverpool get into the final third.4 min: Alexander-Arnold curls the ball round the back of the Chelsea defence for Firmino to run on to. It’s a lovely ball. Firmino gets a yard on Cahill and then rifles a shot from 15 yards at Courtois, who parries and then smothers at the second attempt. This has been a strong start by Liverpool.2 min: Liverpool enjoy a bit of early possession, knocking the ball around at the back under very little pressure and then into midfield. I’m not sure Chelsea have had a touch yet.1 min: Peep! We’re off. Liverpool get the game under way. They are shooting from left to right on my TV. Chelsea are going the other way.There is a minute’s applause for Roy Bentley, the former Chelsea captain, who died recently at the age of 93. He played over 300 games for Chelsea.The teams are out. Chelsea in blue and Liverpool in red, as it should be. And it’s a lovely, warm spring day at Stamford Bridge. Perfect.It’s almost time for kick-off. For some reason Mike Buffer, the boxing announcer, has just been warbling a rally-cry on the sidelines. Pipe down Mike.Antonio Conte speaks: “We are trying to fight until the end to get a place in the Champions League. We won the last three games and we have only one option – to win and to keep the hope alive. But it wont be easy because we know the situation is not in our hands. We know very well if we dont win today this race is finished.On coping with Liverpool’s attack, Conte says: “We are talking about a team who, if they have space, they are very good. We must be very compact. With the ball, we must try to be dangerous.” On not selecting Morata he says he is injured but he should be back for the next game. The awful news that Alex Ferguson suffered a brain hemorrhage yesterday has shocked many this weekend. Jurgen Klopp has just been speaking about the former Manchester United manager’s huge standing in the game. “He was one of the biggest role models in this business. It was a big shock. From what I have heard – and I don’t know any more than anybody else – it looks like he is on his way to recovery but we all want to send our best wishes to Alex from LFC.” The Chelsea manager, Antonio Conte, echoed Klopp’s comments wishing Ferguson a speedy recovery.And our chief football correspondent, Daniel Taylor, has written this fine piece about Ferguson. Get well soon Alex. Mohamed Salah will need four goals from Liverpool’s three remaining matches to equal Ian Rush’s record haul of 47 in the 1983-84 season. Rush reached that magnificent figure in 65 games. Salah has scored 43 in 50 so far for Liverpool. Incredible.So two strong teams then, with Liverpool fielding their usual front three and only resting one player in midfield, with Trent Alexander-Arnold moving into the middle to take the place of Jordan Henderson, and Nathaniel Clyne coming in at right-back.Afternoon. Let’s get straight to the point: Liverpool need one of them to secure a tour-four spot and Champions League football next season. If Chelsea win, they keep their top-four hopes alive – especially so given that Spurs lost yesterday – but to take Liverpool’s place in the top four they would need wins against Huddersfield and Newcastle as well as requiring Klopp’s side to lose or draw at home against Brighton on the final day. So their hopes are still slim but with most of the Premier League teams now playing for very little at least something is riding on this.A Liverpool draw or win would enable Klopp’s side to power down until the 26 May, when they face Real Madrid in Kiev, and recent post-European Premier League games suggest a draw is likely. They’ve drawn 0-0 against Everton, 2-2 with West Brom and 0-0 with Stoke after Champions League matches. But Chelsea are in their best form since early September, having won four games on the bounce and would like to stretch that to five here.The last time the two sides met, in November at Anfield, Mo Salah scored for Liverpool (well, who else?) before Willian equalised for Chelsea with what appeared to be a cross. Liverpool would take the same result again here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d084865750ee24276944ca9bc351bf527a0e935/0_49_4838_2903/master/4838.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a780b2bfc96bc4b2bce7c3f560c4f0d","title":"manchester city v huddersfield town premier league live","story":"A superb effort from Huddersfield earned them a valuable point as they battle to avoid relegation, but City, who were presented with Premier League trophy at full-time, are still on target to break its points, wins and goals recordSo that appears to be that. Manchester City are the champions of England, and have done an amazing job in destroying the field playing brilliant football. Good luck to all those trying to stop them next season.Now, join Gregg Bakowski for Chelsea-Liverpool here:Otherwise, thanks for reading and enjoy the rest of the weekend. Thierry Henry says retaining a title is hard, and notes that his Arsenal team couldn’t manage it. But it’s very hard to see anyone catching up with City over the summer - they’re the best by miles, and are still improving. Arsenal did it in 2001-02 after United effectively clinched the title on New Year’s Day, but I don’t think Guardiola is about to reconstruct his midfield nor sign Laurent Blanc. David Silva says he’s so happy - his son, born prematurely, is getting better, and City have won the league. He says he feels good and then Walker and Stones attack him with streamers. And here’s the man himself. He says it’s special and the team fully deserve their success. He says the team are building very well and will be better next year. Mendy now has the mic and says everyone loves him - him being Toure.Jamie Redknapp is rhapsodising about how great Yaya Toure is, so here’s a piece about him and the concept of greatnes by, er, me. John Stones says he was talking to Kyle Walker saying this is why they came to City, to win trophies, and they didn’t know how it’d feel but it’s an amazing feeling. Sterling comes over and says he’s been dreaming about this since he was a kid, now it’s time to go again. An ominous thought for the rest of the league. He says winning in England is harder than winning in Spain and Germany, and he expects more from the competition next season. Teams who’ve won the league haven’t qualified for the Champions League the following year, so to retain the title in England is difficult. Guardiola then gives Souness a City shirt with 65 on the back - it’s his birthday today - Souness is really touched - and says Thierry Henry should be a manager. Guardiola says that England is special, and he had no doubts about the right thing to do. You have to do what you believe, he says, and today is the proof that City can improve. He then explains the input of Guardiola, and the drive he’s instilled in the players. He says he never doubted that he’d get back to moments such as this after every injury, and that someone told him how amazed they are by how positive he is the day after hurting himself. Champagne is being poured over Kompany’s head ... it takes a while. Hey Jude is pounding out of the PA and Pep Guardiola looks pensive as he enjoys the moment. The trophy is now going along the line, and the players are posing in various groups of mates. “Simply the best, so much better than all the rest!” says Martin Tyler. He was immediately fired for his behaviour. Then, waiting till last, Vincent Kompany. He invites Sergio Aguero to grab a handle, wiggles arm and hand, and lifts the trophy! A special cheer is reserved for Yaya Toure, who is then mobbed by the rest of the players. What a star he was and is, a big-match specialist and a stereotype-smashing symbol of skill, finesse, power and intelligence. I wonder if people still think Fabian Delph should’ve stayed at Villa and Kyle Walker should’ve stayed at Spurs. Maybe that sentence could’ve ended when the bold did. And now onto the big boys, starting with Ederson...Guardiola receives his medal from Richard Scudamore but even that doesn’t seem to tarnish the mood. Over the PA, the players are summoned to the dais, the youngest of them first. And here they come! Guardiola runs out of the tunnel, high fives the guard of honour formed by those already out, and the players follow. What a season they’ve had! I should add that everyone has City kits with “Champions 18” on the back. That is somewhat naff, in my humble opinion according to Gregg Bakoswki, sitting next to me, it looks like they’ve won 18 titles. Maybe what’s in fact happened is they’ve all changed their name to “Champions”. You’d have to respect that. Mikel Arterta leads out the coaches with his frankly phenomenal hairline, and Brian Kidd brings up the rear. bIt’s carried by two members of the club’s One City programme one boy who plays for amputee team and another who plays for the down syndrome team. Out come the various backroom staff in various shortnesses of short shorts. They applaud the crowd as the crowd are applauding them, which they aren’t. I can tell you that this version is so bad, I’m not even getting that weird feeling you get when you unexpectedly hear music you’re more accustomed to experiencing when you’re in a way. This band are now playing Alice Deejay. I don’t know, really I don’t.This is a bit odd - there’a bloke wearing a wispy beard with a ponytail therein and a tie-dye t-shirt, playing drums and various zany friends with other instruments. It turns out the presentation has been delayed because Fernandinho needs to take a slash for the drug testers and is wilting under pressure. In other news, John Stones is wearing glasses, I think. The stage is pretty much set up now - it’s a sort of mauve affair - and in a few minutes, Vincent Kompany will show the Premier League trophy to an array of photographers.Jorgensen says that Huddersfield had the belief they could do it, and the gameplan to press high worked really well for 30 minutes until they got tired - “It’s horrible, but when you take away a point it’s all worth it”. Then in the second half, they double-marked the wingers which worked well too and he says it’s given them the confidence that if they can take a point off City they can do the necessary against Chelsea and Arsenal. He seems an absolutely sound bloke.Anyway, stick with me for the trophy-lift, assorted pyrotechnics, and perhaps some crying children. So City need three points from their last two games to break the Premier League points record held by Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea, need two more goals to break the goal record held by Carlo Ancelotti’s Chelsea and need one more win to break the wins record they currently share with Carlo Ancelotti’s Chelsea. I think they might just manage it.A fair quantity of City fans have invaded the pitch, and Sky forget to turn Gary Neville down - he doesn’t seems best pleased that his working day will be extended. That’s an outstanding performance from Huddersfield, who were barely under threat in the second half. It’s fair to say that City weren’t at their best, but Huddersfield really were - they hung in there, played out from the back when they could, and never lost discipline or focus. Still, Huddersfield have a lot of work to do - if Southampton or Swansea get another win, they’ll need a point off Chelsea or Arsenal.90+5 min Can Mikey Dean be there hero?90+5 min David Wagner is flailing for the final whistle, and he’s about to get it...90+4 min Jesus finds the ball on the edge of the box, right-hand side, and slides square for Otamendi ... who tries for a curler inside the near post, but is wide and plenty. 90+2 min A brilliant, hard tackle from Kongolo, right on the edge of the box, stops Sane as he looks to go through the middle so City work the ball left, whereupon Malone calmly nots down into space so that Lossl can arrive and collect. Excellent work. 90+1 min Malone barges through Bernardo on halfway! Yeah, I know you’re thinking like yeah, whatevz, I could do that, but he pushes forward and runs out of pace and gas around the edge of the box, so dredges up a shot that Ederson beats away. 90 min There’ll be four added minutes. 90 min This game is petering out. Well done Huddersfield, who’ve disappeared the last 20 minutes with no alarms or surprises and barely any cheating.88 min If Huddersfield get a point here, they won’t be safe or anything like it one win for Southampton or Swansea will put them ahead on goal difference. But it’s a start, and will give them confidence they can do something against Chelsea and Arsenal.87 min Mendy tries a shot from distance that rushes high and wide, then goes again when a corner is cleared to him, this time dribbling an effort wide. 85 min “Your logic means you can’t be a great side unless there’s another great side and you dominate them,” tweets @goutmaskreplica. “That’s harsh. Lord Ferg’s double-double winning team was a great side, but their rivals were teams like Villa, Blackburn and Keegan’s NUFC. Scarcely Arsenal 1999.”I disagree here. The 94 side was not the same as the 96 side, and neither was great because they didn’t beat anyone good. But you don’t have dominate a great side to be great, but it’s important that you compete with one not essential, but important. 83 min Bernardo curls over a cross at which Lossl flaps but in the process does enough to get the ball away from immediate danger. City win a corner though, again it goes to the near post, and again it’s cleared - this time by Jorgensen. Waiting outside the is Bernardo, and he swivels into a low shot that swings just wide. 82 min Change for Huddersfield: Van La Parra replaces Pritchard. 82 min Yes, I am searching out database for photos of Lil Mikey Dean. 80 min After somw slow build-up, Mendy swings over an early cross, picking out Jesus. But Schindler is up alongside him, doing enough to ensure that the header loops well over the to. 78 min There’s not a lot going on here. City want to win and all, but speaking as an elite athlete, it’s hard to peak when it doesn’t matter. 77 min Lowe is down with cramp, so he milks as much time as he can before Scott Malone replaces him. 76 min Silva finds Sterling, who flaps past Lowe and is flattened. Eventually, Mike Dean appraises no advantage so stops play and hands out a disappointingly understated yellow card. 75 min It’s attack v defence now, and Huddersfield have earned the right to attempt that. But they’ve got maybe 20 minutes to avoid conceding, which sounds like a long-arse time to me.73 min Gary Neville was sure Foden would get a run out today, but Guardiola wants to win and presumably wants to thank Bernardo Silva for his efforts, so he replaces John Stones. presume City are going three at the back. 72 min And again, Sane goes for the near post, but again Huddersfield clear ... to no one, so back comes the ball. Nonetheless, the away side are relatively comfortable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2bc9ed4d450c6aec96dfa929f4e4a7f1bcfb3dd/0_157_2753_1651/master/2753.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34d808087fedbe62bfb8bdd93b292aa0","title":"azzedine alaia design museum couturier darling designer","story":"A stunning show at the Design Museum presents the master couturier’s own vision – although sadly he won’t see itWhen Azzedine Alaïa, the Tunisian master couturier, died of a heart attack in Paris last November, aged 82, the Design Museum in London was seven months into preparing a big show dedicated to his work. It was to be the first fashion exhibition in the museum’s new building in Kensington and the choice of Alaïa had been carefully made. “The museum has very special architecture,” says Alice Black, co-director. “What Azzedine Alaïa created over his career is also striking sculpture. We felt that his work against the backdrop of the museum would be amazing.”Black had come to know the tiny and charismatic designer over the previous few months. The team had been working closely with Alaïa himself, a man known for his perfectionism and hands-on approach. “Azzedine was the heart and soul of his label. For a while I wondered if the exhibition could still go ahead,” says Black. “But because he had really wanted it, everyone took it on themselves to make it happen. It was his concept, his idea, so we hadn’t been left to second guess.”Azzedine Alaïa: The Couturier, curated by Alaïa’s long-term collaborator and friend, Mark Wilson of the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands, opens this Thursday. The museum has resisted the temptation to turn it into a retrospective and has stayed with the designer’s original vision for it to be a study of technique and craft, with more than 60 examples of couture pieces. It is the first-ever UK show dedicated to Alaïa, who is less well known here than in his adopted France. But those who know fashion revere Alaïa almost like no other. The industry loves a secret and there has been a cult surrounding Alaïa for five decades, inspired not only by his unique – although much-imitated – style but by his desire for perfectionism (a dress could take five weeks or five years), his refusal to be dictated to by commercialism and his personal style of business, largely conducted in his atelier-cum-apartment in the Marais around a kitchen table, where Alaïa served guests with his own cuisine.The Alaïa aesthetic is so powerful that, to those who know it, merely uttering the name will summon up a vision – a living, breathing woman, her form enhanced by fabrics that sculpt and mould, clinch and cling. “He’s the master of cut and fit, a sculptor, ” says Wilson. “He didn’t do drawings that somebody else translated. He designed everything directly on to the body. That’s how he made things.” In both his couture and ready-to-wear collections his materials were Lycra bandages, smooth velvet, stretch wool and leather – lots of it, moulded or cut like lace by laser or riveted with silver eyelets. Wilson is showing the couture garments, chosen with Alaïa, in themed clusters – velvet, African-inspired, bandage dresses. “You get to see everything in 360 degrees and the groupings mean the viewer gets a better understanding of the craft and the technique,” says Wilson, who has now curated six Alaïa shows. “If you looked at these pieces separately, you would see less how each of them is very special in its own way. You can really see the cuts and seaming and construction, which in other exhibitions you might not be able to appreciate.”Alaïa saw the exhibition as an installation and asked artists to make screens as a backdrop to his work. “I came up with the idea and Azzedine selected the artists, who include Marc Newson, Tatiana Trouvé and the Bouroullec brothers. Wrapping around the walls is a series of pictures taken by Richard Wentworth, who spent two years documenting Maison Alaïa.“I make clothes women make fashion,” the designer said. For Black, the magic of the Alaïa look is that it is timeless. “They are garments that you look fantastic in today, much as you would have done 20 years ago, or will do in 20 years’ time,” she says. “It’s that craftsmanship, the perfection. In the exhibition you do see patterns and dresses that he’s been working on and reworking throughout his career, but in parallel you see very interesting variations of fabric. He’s always bringing innovation in there – the laser-cutting or working with a glass powder that gives fabric an iridescence. There’s innovation as well as a respect of a certain tradition.”When Michael Jackson made the 1992 video for In the Closet – directed by Herb Ritts, co-starring Naomi Campbell and with a voiceover by Princess Stéphanie of Monaco – Alaïa provided Campbell’s barely there clothes, white crop top and flippy skirt. This was the glitzy stratosphere he inhabited. The designer was made more famous by a line in the 1995 film Clueless when Alicia Silverstone’s fashion-obsessed Cher is robbed at gunpoint and refuses to get to the ground with the immortal words: “You don’t understand, this is an Alaïa!”But Alaïa himself was not a flashy person. The word most used about him is “humble”. He was kind and empathetic, a friend and guide to many people, including Mark Wilson who knew him for 22 years. “Oh, he was a sweetheart. I loved him,” says Wilson. “We were family. He was my favourite artist and he also opened his home to me.” He was a father figure for Naomi Campbell, who knew him as Papa, and moved into his apartment in Paris when she was 16. The model made a compassionate speech about him at the British Fashion Awards after his death last year: “Back in the day, our fridges weren’t stuffed with food: we bought what we ate on a daily basis and if there was one egg left in his fridge, Papa would offer it to me to make an omelette.”Born in Tunis, the child of wheat farmers, he studied sculpture before transferring, self-taught, to fashion. He moved to Paris in 1957 and got a job at Christian Dior, but was dismissed after five days for not having the correct papers. After working with Guy Laroche and Thierry Mugler he set up on his own, but it wasn’t until 1979 that he opened his own atelier, where he dressed Greta Garbo and Marie-Hélène de Rothschild.He is perhaps most recognised for dressing the supermodels who bestrode the 1980s and 90s – Elle Macpherson, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell – as well as the awesome frames of Grace Jones and Stephanie Seymour. The height of these women and his lack of it often proved irresistible to photographers images of the 5ft 3in Alaïa, towered over by some 6ft super-beauty, possess something of the fairytale. But his clothes were not only for Amazons. The Kardashian sisters, with their curves and gloss, look like they were conceived to wear Alaïa and are devotees. So, too, is his friend the gallerist Carla Sozzani, as was her late sister Franca, who was editor-in-chief of Italian Vogue. Pale blonde Italian waifs, they slipped their slim frames into wide-tiered skirts with flat black shoes so that the architecture of the dresses swung around them like kinetic sculpture.“He was at the service of women,” says Black. “Some have been his couture clients for a lifetime – once you start wearing Alaïa you just never stop. But even with his ready-to-wear he put so much attention into the structure. They don’t crumple and don’t fall the wrong way. A lot of the women we’ve talked to mention this feeling of empowerment they have while wearing his clothes. When you feel so beautiful, you feel confident and you can go out and take on the world.”The museum will exhibit a few dresses in the public foyer, alongside photography, as a taster for a wider audience. With a new flagship three-storey Alaïa store recently opened on London’s New Bond Street, this is perhaps the biggest year ever for the once tiny label. Alaïa may have left us, but his legend will endure.Azzedine Alaïa: The Couturier is at The Design Museum from 10 May to 7 October (designmuseum.org)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/634b7105cc55f09cdfade43729354030f0a89e9c/0_20_2245_1346/master/2245.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59d61d397945bb6dc64d143315af578e","title":"good time girl memories of a super groupie","story":"Pamela Des Barres had the giants of rock’n’roll in the palm of her hand, as her candid memoir revealsBarely 30 seconds in and Pamela Des Barres has not so much name-dropped as chucked her diary on the table. I compliment the author of I’m With the Band – one of the all-time classic rock’n’roll memoirs – on her ornate necklace, and she says it used to belong to Psycho actor Janet Leigh. When I ask if she still has the jewellery gifted to her by Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, she replies, bereft: “No, it was stolen, by a kleptomaniac married to one of the Beach Boys.”Then, as we scan the menu in the rapidly busying Friday night dining room of an in-crowd Hollywood hotel, I idly enquire as to her dietary habits. “I haven’t eaten red meat for 45 years. I went with Don Johnson, one of my dudes,” she says of the then-future star of Miami Vice, “to the first vegetarian restaurant in LA. And I saw on the back of the menu how we get the red meat. And I was so appalled that I stopped that day.”I’m With the Band, the classic confessional of Des Barres’s sexual and romantic escapades with a cacophony of rock stars, is republished in a 30th anniversary edition this month. In bracing detail, the woman born Pamela Miller in Reseda, California, details her high jinks on the Sunset Strip of late-60s and early-70s Los Angeles.Led Zep, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Buffalo Springfield, the Byrds, Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa, the Kinks, the Who… These were many of the greatest acts of the cultural revolution, and Pamela – who turned 20 in 1968 – knew them all. She alchemised adolescent Beatles fandom into a new type of ardour: that of the groupie.“A groupie is someone who loves the music so much she wants to be around the people who make it,” she explains. “A fan is content with an autograph or a look from the stage, or a selfie. A groupie takes the next step. And that takes a lot of courage. But they do so totally willingly, sometimes hoping for a romance, or a one-night stand – or sometimes hoping to marry them,” Des Barres hoots.If groupie behaviour was judged then – the loose morals of silly girls, exploited by lascivious rock stars – it can appear even less savoury today. But before we get into that – and the still-no-holds-barred Des Barres, now 69, will happily get into that – let’s view a highlights reel.As depicted in the book, the gateway crush for the teenager who Robert Plant and Mick Jagger would come to call “Miss Pamela” was the singer with San Diego band Iron Butterfly. But her relationship with Who drummer Keith Moon was considerably more important, even though she was simultaneously seeing renegade country singer Waylon Jennings. “I was Keith’s LA girl, and there was no doubt about it. I knew that whenever he came to town he’d call no one but me,” Des Barres recalls, wistful even now for the tragic Moon the Loon, who died in 1978 aged 32.“I was the muse,” she adds, “and I don’t care what people say about that. Groupies enhanced these people’s lives in a huge way. And if it weren’t for us, they would not be who they are.” Page was more meaningful still. “I was in love with Jimmy and I was gonna be true to him. At this point I had only slept with four people people think I was this wild insane maniac!” But then along came Jagger, whom she’d lusted after since her school days. “Mick was number five. He convinced me that Jimmy wasn’t being true to me on the road. So I decided, ‘OK, I’ve wanted this guy forever, I might as well do it.’ And we had this long-term fling that was really awesome.”Her love of English rock stars eventually propelled Des Barres to Chelsea, in the heart of Swinging London. When two American tourists mistook her for Jagger’s girlfriend she thought she’d attained some kind of nirvana. “Fucking Mick on his pillows in the middle of his living room, listening to Dylan,” Des Barres sighs now, wistful once more. “There was nothing better on earth.”What was Jagger’s reaction when I’m With The Band was originally published? “He was asked once in Rolling Stone what he thought of the book. He said: ‘I was there.’ It made me feel good. He had no problem with it, in other words. No one has.” So no one tried to sue her? “Absolutely not. Because I was telling the truth, in a sweet way. I was telling my truth.”Of course, there’s truth then, and there’s perception now. We discuss her friend and fellow groupie Lori Maddox. She’s been dragged into social media “debates” in the #MeToo era from those who decry her losing her virginity to David Bowie at the age of 15. “I’m very proud of Lori for the way she’s handled this whole thing. She’s very proud of her history. She has no regrets at all. A lot of people have come after her and she just doesn’t rise to it.”Do they come after her because, as she was 15 she was, by definition, abused? “She was not abused,” is Des Barres’s firm conviction. “Because that’s what she wanted. Yeah, she was young. And nowadays 15 is not what it used to be. And prior to that era, 15 was not what it became. It was just a period in time when things like that happened and it was OK! It was a short period in time. But it was our reality, and everyone was OK with it.”In 1977, Pamela married English rock star Michael Des Barres. He was a raging cocaine addict so she vowed, on the spot, to give up drugs. They had a son together, but orced in 1991. She’s had a few relationships since then, but is currently single. Today she finds strength in her faith, something that has deepened over the years. As to how she squares her sexual escapades with Christian morality, she acknowledges that, “I fought with it. Until I finally realised that the orgasm – la petite mort – is godly. The orgasm is when you actually forget everything else but that. So you are actually one with all that is. And when the orgasms continued, I came to realise that sex is so good, so important, so connecting with the ine.”Putting her CV where her soul is, she’s also an ordained minister. Pamela Des Barres can officiate your wedding and throw in, too, eye-popping anecdotes about Jim Morrison getting her off gorilla anaesthetic Trimar, and why she only went to third base with the Kinks’ Ray Davies.These days, Des Barres still lives for the music. She throws gigs in her backyard, and hosts rock’n’roll tours of “her” LA for tourists. “I’ve become this historical person,” she smiles, “which is so weird.”But don’t go mistaking that for sadness, an elegy for an era whose time’s up, for a youth wasted. Pamela Des Barres was her own woman then and she’s her own woman now.“I miss a lot of people who didn’t make it,” she says quietly, “but there are plenty people who did. So, no, I have no sadness about it at all.” I’m With The Band: Confessions of a Groupie by Pamela Des Barres is published by Omnibus Press at £14.99.

From then until 2011, I hadn’t set foot in the other side of the park. There are an awful lot of stories like\u0026nbspthat.”The three-metre fence, one of scores of so-called “peace walls” that still ide loyalist and nationalist communities in Northern Ireland, was erected in 1994. Yet thanks to work by cross-community workers such as Shannon, and after a lengthy consultation exercise, the gate was added in 2011.“We were having people coming from all over the world to look at our gate,” he says. “It was the symbolism. People started moving freely through it. Gradually we opened it later and later. Now we’re in the position where it’s open all day, every day.”Twenty years on from the Good Friday Agreement, similar cross-community projects are under way with the aim of taking down peace walls across the city. The fact that so many remain in place is evidence of the often glacial pace of progress. As the painstaking work continues, however, it is not lost on those labouring to bring down physical and sectarian barriers that the vote for Brexit has led to the threat of new ones being erected.The British and Irish governments and the European Union have all said that they do not want the return of any border infrastructure on the island of Ireland. Yet London’s determination to leave both the EU’s customs union and the single market has created a policy problem that is proving perhaps the most challenging aspect of the Brexit fallout.When Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, visited border communities and businesses last week, he was told in no uncertain terms about the strength of feeling involved in even the most innocuous border equipment.“I’m 60 years old, I’ve lived right along the border all my life,” says Declan Fearon, a kitchen maker who is part of a border group that met Barnier. He used to be able to see a border watchtower from his house near Jonesborough. “I remember the days when some people who came to mass on a Sunday used to have to park at the barriers and walk to the chapel. The last watchtower to be taken away was the one right behind my home.“I’ve lived through all of that and I really fear the return of any of that for my grandkids and the psychological impact on a community here that lived with it for so many years. It’s reopening a wound. It is quite clear that no one wants a return to the border, but are the British government being genuine on proposing how to do that? No, they’re not. There was palpable anger felt here when Boris Johnson compared this issue to the London congestion charge. Come along and meet the people who are worried about this.”One official who has been working on cross-border trade since the Good Friday Agreement recalls that, at the start of the process, he had to attend all meetings with the text of the legislation piled on the table, because there were inevitable arguments about interpreting the level of cooperation it stipulated.Now the meetings have become reassuringly boring, focused on how to help economies both north and south. “When we started, we were looking at barriers,” the official explains. “Now we look at opportunities. With Brexit, there’s the potential that you could be going back to dealing with barriers, and I think everyone is agreed that that isn’t what we want.”In Belfast, as with so many issues, many fear that Brexit and the border issue is already adding another sectarian strut to community politics. In Tigers Bay, the loyalist community on one side of Alexandra Park, a new mural appeared during the referendum campaign that reads “Vote Leave EU” and is accompanied by a reference to a biblical verse: Revelation chapter 18 verse 4.The verse states: “And I heard another voice from the heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye not be partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.” Rab McCallum, a former republican prisoner who now works to remove peace walls through the North Belfast Interface Network, is among those with concerns. He is sitting in a coffee shop in the Houben Centre, north Belfast, another cross-community project. It has an entrance on either side of the building, in effect connecting the loyalist and nationalist parts of what he describes as “one of the most notorious interfaces in all of the Troubles”.“There have been more people killed here than all other areas, so it has been hugely impacted by the conflict,” he says. “We had the success of taking down the first peace wall in 30 years, just across the road, at a time when there were problems. Despite the lack of political progress, the people on the ground seemed to be in front of the political process.The everyday impact of the border dilemma is being missed in the Westminster debate, warns Deirdre Heenan, professor of social policy at Ulster University, who is also from a border community near Newry.“I was in London last week and there was discussion about the trade and the economy and the customs union and the single market, but absolutely no discussion of the psychological and social impact of a border – whatever it may look like,” she says.“Most people believe that the British government don’t understand the problem. It’s not only that they haven’t come up with a solution, it’s that they can’t come up with a solution to a problem they don’t understand.“Clearly in the referendum, the fact that we would be the only land border to the EU wasn’t thought about. We were an afterthought. Yes, we have a peace, but it is a fragile peace. It is a journey we are on and we haven’t reached the final destination.“Sometimes it sounds like overstatement, but borders have an emotional meaning and they are symbols of difference. That just seems to be dismissed, but it is hugely significant for people here.”Of the Irish officials and ministers the Observer consulted last week, all said that the British government had failed to provide any confidence that it had a solution to resolve its promise of a frictionless border. As a result, all pointed to the so-called “backstop” agreement signed by Theresa May last year, which dictates that, should the UK government fail to provide a solution, Northern Ireland would remain in a “common regulatory area” with the EU.“The UK government signed off on a backstop arrangement,” says Michael Creed, the Irish agriculture minister. “That’s the fail-safe. For reasons that transcend economics, there can be no resiling from that commitment. If the UK comes up with a better arrangement, obviously the Barnier taskforce and the Irish government are quite open to seeing the colour of that and how it would effectively operate. There can be no resiling from that backstop arrangement.”For all the concerns, however, supporters of Brexit warn that the issues around the border and the impact on the peace process are being inflated as a negotiating tactic\u0026nbspby both Ireland and the EU. Refusing to give any ground could ultimately force the UK to remain inside the bloc’s customs union and single market.“The border is perfectly solvable,” says Lee Reynolds, the DUP director of policy and former Vote Leave coordinator in Northern Ireland. “Things that were presented as insurmountable have already been surmounted. The EU is offering a no-tariff deal already. There are a lot of things that were part of Project Fear that have been dealt with and resolved. They were legitimate things to raise, but it doesn’t mean they were impossible.“The border has got wrapped up in much bigger negotiating politics. It isn’t true that there is no solution. It’s that some people would prefer there not to be one. The best thing that ever happened for Vote Leave was when Tony Blair and John Major came over to threaten the peace process. That’s when unionists drifting to Leave became like snow off a ditch.”He adds that, far from undoing cross-community work, Brexit could be an opportunity for more. “Brexit is not an event, it’s what we do with it,” he says. “We can rethink regional policy and try to do better things. There will be potential for more resource – we have money coming back to us. People are talking about keeping existing money, when they should be asking if there is any scope for more. A new round of peace funding has also been secured.”This sunny optimism cuts little ice with people such as Fearon. He believes that feeling on the issue is so strong, and the determination not to return to the bad old days so deep-rooted, that people might take matters into their own hands should any border infrastructure pop up.Leading Brexiters argue that new technology can be used to find ways of allowing frictionless trade across the Irish border - and the technology would not have to be placed on the border itself. However, details have been thin on the ground and many warn that no such solution currently exists.A special dealThe European Union would allow Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and the single market, but that would mean checks between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain - an outcome fiercely opposed by unionists. It would also lead to demands for a similar deal for Scotland, putting Scottish Tory MPs at loggerheads with the leadership.A customs partnershipThe UK would collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf, easing the need for border checks. Problems remain, however. The idea is opposed by Brexiter cabinet ministers and dismissed by the EU. A partnership would also have to be accompanied by a degree of alignment with the EU’s single market to eliminate checks completely.Soft BrexitOpting to keep the entire UK fully inside the EU’s customs union and single market would provide a solution to the Irish border, but would also require Theresa May to rip up her red lines of leaving both. It would also mean Britain could not strike its own trade deals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5856f4e08293a52c6f59ed5bcab026615425099b/312_995_5624_3374/master/5624.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=472400abf7495f26ec498aa7cbb35b3a","title":"african express how bright textiles brought one london home to life","story":"Eva Sonaike’s Nigerian heritage inspires the vibrant colours and patterns at her family houseEva Sonaike’s journey to becoming a textile designer began when she realised she could no longer stand the bland character of the small flat she and her husband used to share. “I was on maternity leave and I felt the need to make it warm, welcoming and more ‘us’,” she says. Eva headed to London’s Petticoat Lane market and bought bolts of bright African wax fabrics to make into cushion covers, throws and curtains.“As a quick fix, it worked,” she says. “Of course, I now know that those materials aren’t right for upholstery – too flimsy, not colourfast and so on. But it made me see very clearly how vibrant fabrics can bring joy into a space.”Ten years later, Eva has moved on – both career-wise and to a new home. She’s designing full time, working from a studio in the garden of her 1930s house in north London, where she lives with her husband Kola Sonaike, a barrister, their son Lolu, aged 10, and daughter Lola, eight.“When we bought this house it was a typical semi and the downstairs rooms were fairly dark,” says Eva. The couple knocked through the ground floor rooms and extended it to create one large split-level space. “My wish list was simple: white walls, dark floors and lots of light,” says Eva. “I knew I was going to add colour and pattern. And I think that works best with a light, clean backdrop.”Inspiration for her fabric designs comes from the regular trips she has made to west Africa since she was a child. While Eva was born in Germany and lived there until moving to London in her 20s to work as a fashion editor, her heritage is Nigerian. “I grew up knowing that fabrics were held in high esteem in Yoruba culture,” she says. “Thickly woven aso oke cloth was once a form of currency and is still given as a special gift. Or the embroidery on clothing could hold meaning – it might ward off evil, bring wealth or attract a spouse. Fabrics were never just pieces of cloth . They always told some kind of story.”Eva still travels to Africa each year with her own family, trips that now provide the stories for her own designs. “When I’m there, I’m like a sponge,” she says. “I soak up visual stimuli, the scents and the atmosphere. I see patterns in everything, from architecture to nature.”The motifs she sketches are later scanned into Photoshop, where she refines them and adds colours. Eva points to her Ijoba cushion, featuring lush leaves arranged in a stylised 50s-feel pattern. “This one came about after a trip to Ghana for a wedding. Afterwards we took the children up into the mountains to visit an old botanical gardens,” she says. “Everyone said: ‘Don’t bother, it’s so run-down’ – but that just made me want to go even more. When we arrived, the place was shrouded in mist and it felt as if nature had been left to run wild. The gardens were teeming with life – plants unfurling and exploding into flower.”Another design, Ojo, was inspired by the tropical modernism-style walls and balconies of Lagos, reimagined by Eva into an elegant grid of golds and reds. “That post-colonial architecture is an everyday feature of Lagos life,” she says. “I wanted to bring out its beauty.” Other prints feature zebra stripes recast in neon shades, a softened version of batik and shapes inspired by Yoruba embroidery.In her home, Eva’s patterns are complemented by African artefacts that have been in her family since the 1960s and 1970s. “My father was an art historian, so he had a very good eye,” she says. Eva and Kola have added carved figures bought more recently in Lagos’s craft markets. “Look beyond rows of statues darkened with shoe polish and sanded to ‘age’ them and you’ll always find beautifully crafted objects,” she says.Other pieces in Eva’s home include German antiques, a table from north Africa (by way of a Fulham dealer) and high street buys from Habitat and Ikea. Eva also confesses to a bit of a HomeSense habit for vases and lamp bases. “My daughter used to do a gym class near a branch, which was fatal. Luckily, she’s just switched to a ballet class further away.”Back in the dining room, a painting by Damola Adepoju from Nike Art Gallery in Lagos reminds the couple of trips to the city, with its streets rammed with yellow buses. And in the living room, above the cushions depicting her own African-inspired designs, Eva has hung a photograph of a Sudanese girl by Eliot Elisofon. It was taken in 1947 for Life magazine. “It dates from a very different era,” she says. “But as a celebration of African culture and beauty, it still feels very relevant today.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ebea6650a93cdd76c7cb9d7d9b6f3a06a3a12a5/495_511_4625_2775/master/4625.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d70ae44cdfa44e546b135441abd78bb","title":"is is weird to write to say sorry to my ex three years on","story":"Do it! Says Mariella. Keep it simple, keep it brief, write it from the heartThe dilemma Three years ago, I split up with my girlfriend of seven years. I felt very unhappy and put it down to the relationship. She was devastated and wanted to resolve things. But by that stage I’d made my mind up. I’ve lived a quiet, celibate life since, which has given me time to reflect. It struck me that I’d been very selfish – after an initial romantic period where I pulled all manner of stunts to impress her, my effort as a boyfriend tapered down to the bare minimum. Secondly, I realised they had been the best days of my life. We went on amazing adventures which we probably wouldn’t have done otherwise, and had very different skills sets, which complemented each other. After we split up, I made little effort to maintain our friendship, maybe because I felt guilty. Now I’m ashamed of how I treated her and can’t forgive myself. I want to write and apologise, but it sounds weird and inappropriate. It’s hard to write without it sounding like a rapprochement, which it isn’t. Is writing such a letter an appropriate thing to do?Mariella replies Hell, yes! We should all be writing letters to our lovers, ex or otherwise whether it’s just to say hello, to expand on our feelings, because our behaviour has been less than exemplary, or perhaps, as in your case, to say thanks for a union that may be long over but in hindsight appears so much more precious than you realised at the time. There are few things more soul enhancing than knowing that you’ve had a positive impact on another person’s life, that you were appreciated and that whatever may have led to your parting, a residue of love remains scattered over the debris of the relationship.I’d argue we should be writing more missives of the tangible and non-electronic variety. Otherwise when we’re old and grey how will we know that anyone cared for us at all, or remember the names of those who have long since slipped from our lives, emotionally, geographically or permanently? Searching your inbox just isn’t the same as dragging a box from the loft and having your life leap out to meet you. I recently found a folder full of a jumble of past correspondence, covering old love letters and fractious disputes, baffling postcards of some importance at the time and notes from luminaries whose attention I briefly captured for one reason or another – and it proved an emotional couple of hours sifting through those faded but still legible scraps.A message to my hotel room in Morocco in the 1990s read like a title for a novel: “Mr Miss You from Rabat” had called, hurling me back to memories of Robert, the gentleman caller, who’d obviously challenged the translating abilities of the Mamounia operator with his note. On another sliver of near-translucent paper was the marriage proposal I received three decades ago via a switchboard operator at the Parker Meridien in New York who’d hastily typed it up and slipped it under my door with a squashed red rose! There were sexy letters from a lover that made me blush, extolling my “eyes as green as Eastleach water meadows” and a letter from my mother with her overview on the chronology of my peripatetic childhood. There was huge pleasure in revisiting those moments, the words belying the heft of the emotions they bore while the paper carried sensory messages from a past age.Communication today is functional, and deleted within seconds of receipt. Like the photographs that linger in devices that become obsolete faster than we can learn to use them, it seems that the next generation will have to trawl Facebook to take their trips down memory lane. It certainly lacks the romance of a battered box, but since Facebook seems to know more about us than we do ourselves it may nonetheless prove a riveting archive. What a sad loss though to be unable to sniff the leaf, puzzle over the smudges or feel your heart leap at the loop of familiar handwriting decades after it was last viewed. As a regular performer for the brilliantly conceived Letters Live project, I’ve had the pleasure of exposure to some of the finest letters ever written and whether they’re slapping you down, or building you up, they’re a much undervalued art form.So, your heart is in the right place and your compulsion a good one. I’m wondering if your reluctance to write and let her know it wasn’t her fault is because what you are secretly after is a rapprochement. If that’s the case I’m not in a position to judge whether it’s right or wrong, but it does slightly temper my enthusiasm. The greatest gift in the world is a letter that wants nothing but offers a loving thought, or apology, or simply a hello.Keep it simple is my advice don’t try to channel Shelley. If all you want is tell her you regret your behaviour and think of that period with fondness, do just that. Keep it brief, don’t overload the memories, write it from the heart and don’t go into detail about your current state of mind. This letter, if your description is an accurate one, is not about you. So don’t dally another moment, put pen to paper and get your sense of gratitude off your chest and into her heart.

The band’s name is also emblazoned on the back of struggling Stockport County FC’s Edgeley Park stadium and in front of the vintage Wurlitzer organ in this beautiful art deco cinema. In between, there have been two top five albums (including a No 1 with their eponymous debut) and gigs at Wembley Stadium with the Stone Roses, which would have been the stuff of dreams when they were rehearsing in a scaffolding yard and making videos for £60. Along the way, they have transformed from a vaguely psychedelic indie guitar band with bowl cuts into a full-on, shiny, keyboard-dominated pop thing. Where their guitar-based music once had echoes of Pink Floyd, their luxuriant synth-pop now shares DNA with the likes of A-ha, the Human League and Abba. Named after a nearby pub, Blossoms may look like regular northern lads, albeit with hippy hair, but their sound owes much to the kind of keyboard-heavy 80s pop bands with daft names who would gaze moodily into the middle distance under elaborate New Romantic coiffures.

Apart from shouting “Have we got a rowdy balcony?” (which quakes in approval), they mostly just get on and play the songs – 18 of them, with 10 from the new album. On record, Myles Kellock’s fairground keyboards are ramped up for the radio, so it’s nice to hear subtleties such as Charlie Salt’s Chic basslines. Doorsier old songs such as Blow or Cut Me and I’ll Bleed could be a different band, but demonstrate that even when Blossoms were dressing like the Rutles, they had the devotion to verse, chorus and middle eight that is the hallmark of a singles group. Strip away the electronics and I Just Imagined You could be the 1960s Hollies. The deluxe version of Cool Like You does unplug the synth – for lovely acoustic, campfire versions of the songs that are closer to Fleet Foxes than Duran Duran. When Ogden dons an acoustic guitar for a solo spot here, his own Love Talk more than holds its own in a singalong covers medley that hurtles from Baby Bird’s You’re Gorgeous to George Michael’s Last Christmas. The synths are plugged back in and Charlemagne’s big, bouncy riff – the blueprint for Blossoms 2.0 – completes the celebrations in a town that is audibly delighted to have something to sing about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34fd3eb5bf1fafad6d6e7058dc57b5998ce2ef8c/0_54_2858_1715/master/2858.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b091b14bbabcd34445e2428f5c8d46e7","title":"local elections brexit little comfort right or left","story":"Entering the West Midlands market town of Nuneaton, there are signs saying “Nuneaton and Bedworth – United to Achieve”.

Paul Bull, the local butcher, is one of those anxious about his and his town’s future. “I’ve seen trade get less and less, year on year,” he says. “There are fewer stalls on market days and they usually pack up early – even the nice weather doesn’t get people out.”At every election, local or national, the attention of politicians and political pundits turns to Nuneaton, a key marginal, a bellwether seat in the heart of England that oscillates between Labour and the Tories. It is a place to gauge the national mood and the political temperature in middle Britain.It expressed its discontent at the 2016 referendum by voting by 6634 for Brexit. Last week, after eight years of Conservative government at Westminster, and against the backdrop of crises over immigration and the NHS, and deadlock on Brexit, Labour had hoped to benefit from Theresa May’s troubles and consolidate its position on the local council.Yet Labour went backwards. Its tally of seats fell from 25 to 17 while the Conservatives’ went up from seven to 16, depriving Jeremy Corbyn’s party of control.Peter Kang, 48, a financial planning and analysis manager in the town, has voted Ukip in recent elections. But he now looks to the Tories to deliver on Brexit. “There’s no point voting Ukip because they’re just a spent force. It’s about making sure the Tories do what they’re supposed to do over Brexit: voting Labour doesn’t do that.”Yet that Ukip idend for the Conservatives – on a night when the party Nigel Farage once led lost 123 seats and held just three – could become a curse as well as a blessing, at least for those Tories who fear the consequences of an all-singing all-dancing hard Brexit. As the smoke cleared after an election night with no clear victor, one theme of capital importance was being identified by polling expert Professor John Curtice. The mass defection of the Ukip vote to the Tories in Leave areas could store up huge problems for Theresa May, placing the prime minister under even more pressure to deliver the kind of clean Brexit that her new backers, the ex-Ukippers, crave.“The vote that is helping to buoy up Theresa May’s popularity is very much a Leave vote,” Curtice told the BBC. “If the Conservatives are going to hang on to that vote, they are going to have to deliver a Brexit that, broadly speaking, appeals to the sympathies and instinct of Leave voters.”After a week in which pro-Brexit ministers had already quashed plans for a customs partnership with the EU that the prime minister hoped would help unlock the Irish border question, Curtice’s assessment was further music to their ears. Boris Johnson quickly took up the theme on Twitter – that Tories had to reject a customs union or partnership and buy fully into a hard, clean Brexit because that was what voters said they wanted.“Jeremy Corbyn has been abandoned in many Leave areas – his pledge to stay in the customs union means he is not trusted to deliver Brexit. PM’s clear Mansion House vision for leaving the single market and customs union a key part of Tory electoral success,” the foreign secretary tweeted.But there is a problem that will not go away. Last week the Irish government made clear again that it will veto any Brexit deal that fails to deliver a frictionless border between north and south. Neither in Brussels nor in Dublin, nor in soft-Brexit circles in Westminster, can anyone see how that frictionless border can be achieved without some form of customs union – one that ever more people who vote Tory say would amount to a Brexit betrayal.While Tory successes such as Nuneaton may create their own problems, Labour is contemplating a set of results which convey some disturbing messages, and deepen its own angst over what to say and do about Brexit.Labour scored some notable successes, robbing the Tories of control of Trafford in Manchester and taking Plymouth. It performed better in London than at any time since 1971. But there were similar stories to that of Nuneaton in too many other areas of provincial England where it had hoped to do well.Some Labour MPs and council candidates in the party’s ranks said the results were nowhere near good enough for an opposition fighting a governing party that had been in office for so long, and that never seems able to wrestle free of crises. On Saturday Labour’s Angela Smith, a member of the influential parliamentary committee representing backbenchers, said it was time for the party to “take a long hard look at ourselves as many voters don’t like what they see”. Former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: “After eight years of Tory misrule, most people thoroughly tired of austerity, a disastrous Brexit negotiation, the Windrush outrage and four cabinet resignations in six months, we should be well ahead and we are not. If we don’t ask why, then we risk losing a fourth time at the next general election.”Labour lost three councillors in Derby, ceding overall control, as well as losing their leader, Ranjit Banwait. In Basildon the Conservatives took control of the council as they picked up half of 10 seats lost by Ukip. In Redditch, another Leave-voting area, Labour struggled, losing three seats while the Conservatives picked up four to take control of the council.Just as damaging to morale was Labour’s failure to take, or make the hoped-for headway in, any of the traditional Conservative strongholds in London – Wandsworth, Westminster, and Barnet (where the row over antisemitism in the party had a devastating effect). The relief among Tories, even though they lost 33 seats, was palpable. The national picture showed them neck and neck with Labour, but they had outperformed expectations that had been pegged very low.The Liberal Democrats had cause for celebration too, retaking Richmond and Kingston upon Thames councils.Theresa May looked happier than for months as she congratulated Tories in Wandsworth and taunted Labour. “Labour thought they could take control. This was one of their top targets and they threw everything at it, but they failed,” she said on Friday.Corbyn will address the parliamentary party a week tomorrow and will face calls for changes of direction on many fronts. Labour MPs say the crisis over antisemitism needs addressing urgently and is damaging the party more by the week.Gillian Lazarus, a former Labour supporter in the borough, told the Observer: “I’ve always voted Labour and have been a member off and on. I come from a Labour family and am the granddaughter of Jewish immigrants. I could not vote for Labour in the council elections, because I have witnessed the rampant and unremitting antisemitism coming from the Labour environment.”For its part, Labour desperately requires a strategy that stiffens its Remain resolve without alienating voters in the passionately pro-Leave towns of provincial England.Calls are growing from Labour’s Remain majority for it to be bolder in backing a soft Brexit and membership of the single market. That, they say, would open up clear water between the two largest parties. “Why did we fail to do better in London and why did the Lib Dems get back in the game in areas we need to be progressing in?” asked one Labour frontbencher on Friday. “Because people think we have no policy on Brexit that is different from the Tories. Remainers don’t think we are with them. We are a pro-EU party without a pro-EU policy.”Key parliamentary votes are approaching. A group of Labour peers is protesting this weekend that Corbyn is not backing their efforts in the Lords to promote amendments to Brexit legislation that would allow the UK to effectively stay in the single market. Corbyn fears any move that would appear anti-Brexit would hit Labour support hard in the many Leave areas where it routinely returns MPs – a view backed by many of those MPs themselves. While the likes of Umunna push for soft Brexit, or no Brexit, other senior figures in the party argue the reverse.As a crunch period approaches, in which Britain’s future trade agreements with the EU must be agreed one way or the other, the time for judicious equivocation is almost over. Last Thursday’s poll suggests that, for both of the main parties, there is no easy option available. But an option must be chosen.Kate Hoey, Labour MP for Vauxhall and leading pro-Brexit campaigner“These results suggest many ex-Labour Ukip voters don’t yet trust us to genuinely honour the referendum result. While this is the case we simply cannot win the seats we need to form a government. Those who voted Leave in Labour areas want us to stick to our manifesto promises and not be pushed into a Brexit that is in name only.”Chuka Umunna, Labour MP for Streatham and leading anti-Brexit campaigner“Neither major party can treat these results as any kind of endorsement. On Brexit, clearly the country is not coming together behind the prime minister’s hard-Brexit plan or, frankly, the alternative Labour is offering. People deserve leadership on Brexit, the biggest issue of our time – which will fundamentally impact on our ability to end Tory austerity, reduce inequality and poverty, and spread opportunity – and we have yet to see it.”Bernard Jenkin, Conservative MP for Harwich and North Essex“Be wary of drawing conclusions from these results about Brexit. Either Conservatives deliver what the people voted for, or we risk looking indecisive and paralysed, which would never be rewarded at the ballot box. Most people who voted remain want us to get on with Brexit. Governments are rarely rewarded for a reform programme which drags on without conclusion.”Sir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats“We enjoyed a number of gains in areas that voted heavily to leave the EU, including Sunderland and Hull, as well as Remain-leaning areas that commentators would have expected us to do well in. This shows that people respect parties if they have the courage of their convictions, even if they disagree with them. It also reflects that while there can be these disagreements, it is still the case that people correctly place high value on the ability of a party to effectively run a council.”Anna Soubry, Tory MP for Broxtowe and anti-hard-Brexit campaigner“Bins not Brexit won it for the Conservatives in this week’s local elections. That view may not be shared by Tory councillors who lost their seat in places like South Cambridgeshire, Richmond and Wandsworth, but by and large it was hard graft on local issues by moderate, competent Conservatives that saw off Labour and in places even won us seats. The real story is Labour’s failure to make the sort of progress we feared they would, and which they should have made.”Suzanne Evans, former vice-chair of Ukip“The collapse of the Ukip vote worked mostly in the Conservatives’ favour in this election, as the bulk of the Leave vote went to them. This sends a clear message to Theresa May. She must deliver a clean Brexit, one in which we are fully independent from the EU – no fudges or compromises – or Ukip will rise again, strongly, and swiftly, and the Tories will face a massive loss of electoral support at the next general election.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01dfe987bd4aa911edc417854c1f708fef79ef86/0_18_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a786d61ebd1c820152b95fa74254330","title":"hmrc accused of ignoring online vat worth 12bn a year","story":"Campaigners say no rogue traders have been prosecuted for selling wares on Amazon and eBay without VATHM Revenue \u0026amp Customs has been accused of being soft on billions of pounds of VAT fraud committed by rogue traders using online marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay.The accusationcomes after a senior HMRC official said last week that his department had never seized goods from traders suspected of being part of a £1.2bn-a-year VAT fraud via Amazon’s marketplace and other online sites.The scam involves foreign companies warehousing products in the UK and selling them without charging VAT via internet marketplaces.Legitimate traders claim the scam hands the fraudsters an unfair advantage.Richard Allen, founder of Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes (RAVAS), said: “HMRC was handed a dossier containing the names and details of hundreds of fraudsters three years ago. “Yet in that entire period, despite serious and criminal fraud taking place by traders using Amazon warehouses, HMRC has not made a single prosecution or seized goods when it has identified rogue operators.“When measured against the actions of other jurisdictions such as Germany - who have taken enforcement action - or even simple common sense, HMRC’s behaviour can be seen as nothing other than going lenient on Amazon rogue traders”.The chancellor took measures last year to tighten up 2016 legislation designed to force the likes of Amazon and eBay to police their own site for VAT fraudsters. Websites are now jointly liable for ensuring companies selling goods to UK consumers via their websites are paying the correct VAT.But last week, during a public accounts committee hearing, chair Meg Hillier MP, said to HMRC’s deputy chief executive Jim Harra: “According to Amazon ... they said ‘to our knowledge HMRC has never issued a notice to Amazon to seize the third-party goods belonging to a seller in respect of whom they have issued a joint and several liability notice’.”Harra told the committee that : “We don’t think that as our powers currently stand it’s a practical way of us making any meaningful difference here, but it’s definitely an area we want to look at to see if we can use it”.HMRC said that “fully refutes” RAVAS’s claim it has been soft on the fraud and said that it had had 27,550 applications to register for VAT from overseas online retail businesses since its measures on joint liability were introduced in 2016 and 2018.HMRC added: “The UK has led the way in holding online marketplaces jointly liable for VAT evaded overseas and in the UK by being the first country to bring in new powers to hold them to account”.Amazon and eBay have both previously told the committee that they take VAT fraud seriously."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b80dfcaae6111150548ae898b19825b21b7b18c/0_76_8026_4815/master/8026.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e57734157bce6dc7534f3516a0268c0","title":"chef zoe adjonyoh on the smells that unlock family memories","story":"From the childhood smells of frying black pudding and burning peat in Ireland, to the traditional ingredients discovered in Ghana and Dalston, chef Zoe Adjonyoh has always followed her noseListening to Zoe Adjonyoh talk about her dual-heritage upbringing is like reading a foodie travelogue that immediately has you salivating. The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9cc2ffd64603abd569e360f21a91b46d8ac3a20/0_126_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2045dcb85a51db40de652208340a7560","title":"liverpools mohamed salah an egyptian hero for the 21st century","story":"In Nagrig, the footballer’s birthplace, his generosity and rise to fame are inspiring a generation of new sports starsThe village where Mohamed Salah grew up is a cluster of red-brick houses threaded together by dusty unpaved streets and surrounded by a shimmering sea of green fields. In its centre, Ahmed al-Masery sits in an empty coffee shop watching highlights on a tiny, wall-hung TV of his old friend playing for Liverpool against Roma. “I used to play football games on PlayStation with him back in the day,” says the 35-year-old, gesturing at the screen.Back then, Salah would pick Liverpool to play video games with his friend. Now the player is the Merseyside club’s favourite adopted son, a striker whose goals have inspired his team into the Champions League final later this month. Fans are devoted to their “Egyptian king” – one song includes the line “if he scores another few, I’ll be Muslim too”.For the people of Nagrig, a small farming community two buses and a train-ride north of Cairo, Salah’s rise is scarcely believable. The 25-year-old comes back to the village about once a year, al-Masery says, but he’s been totally unspoilt by fame. “He doesn’t even drive when he comes here,” he says. “He walks around the streets like everyone else, speaking to anyone who wants to talk to him.”Much has been made in the Egyptian press of Salah’s charity work. It’s been widely reported that he regularly helps newlyweds furnish their new homes with everything they need for marriage, although the recipients of these gifts have never come out publicly. Newspaper columnists and talk-show hosts delight in sharing examples like these of Salah’s good nature, but al-Masery is one of many Nagrig residents who are sceptical. “Most of these stories are just hearsay,” he says. One particularly popular Salah story came after LE 30,000 (£1,250) was stolen from Salah’s father. The thief was caught and in act of forgiveness, Salah’s family did not press charges. Retellings of the story in the press, however, have Salah intervening personally to help the man find work. One version even has Salah giving the man a wad of cash.“The media just wants to talk about Salah, Salah, Salah,” al-Masery says. “He’s a nice guy, and very respectful, but not everything written about him is true.”Not everybody shares al-Masery’s scepticism about the Salah story. In Cairo, where 200 punters crammed onto the pavement at an outdoor coffee shop to watch Liverpool secure their place in the Champion’s League final, 29-year-old football fan Omar Salem says he “doesn’t care” if certain details about the striker are false. “People want to believe these things about him,” he says. “At this point he’s so loved that nobody would ever deny them.”Before last July, you’d be hard pressed to find anyone here supporting the Merseyside club. That’s all changed this season, though, with football fans regularly turning out in force, for every Liverpool game. “It would just be amazing to have an Egyptian player win the Champion’s League,” Salem says.Salem says it was Egypt’s match against Congo in October that marked the beginning of his status as a national icon. Salah’s penalty, four minutes into injury time, put Egypt ahead at the 11th hour, securing the team a place in its first World Cup in 28 years. “When he celebrated that goal,” says Salem, “that’s the image people will remember from that match.”Salem calls Salah the first big Egyptian player “that people can actually relate to”. “We don’t even know what car he drives,” says Salem. Instead, Salah’s story is that of a humble teenager, who through sheer grit and determination earned the chance to represent his country in the big leagues of Europe.For the kids of Nagrig, at least, the legend of Mohamed Salah is very real. His former school was renamed in his honour, and to talk to pupils here, you’d think his story was part of the curriculum. One such pupil, 13-year-old Osama Eid, tells the story of Salah’s rise to fame as if reciting his 12-times-tables. “He’s very respectful and kind,” he says, “and well-mannered and does a lot of work to help the poor.” According to Eid’s friends, he’s the best footballer of their gang. When asked if he’d like to be like Salah one day, he doesn’t skip a beat: “Inshallah.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cac21fff3027701b1f5ab76ab32170527f44bd85/0_185_3498_2099/master/3498.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57cc63f210f0881db002bb353a28b344","title":"newspaper takeover staggering blow cambodia free press phnom penh post","story":"Phnom Penh Post was seen as last bastion of independence in media under fire from PMFor 30 years Aun Pheap reported on corruption, human rights abuses, elections and political scandals for every major newspaper in Cambodia, a job he felt he was born to do. Now, like so many journalists who worked in Cambodia’s once free press, he is in exile, branded an enemy of the state.For Pheap, formerly a reporter at the Cambodia Daily, which shut down last year, “this is the worst situation for the press and for journalists I have seen in my whole 30-year career”. And it has worsened further this week, with the sale of the Phnom Penh Post, seen as the last bastion of the free press in Cambodia, to the owner of a Malaysian PR company who has links to the regime of the Cambodian prime minister, Hun Sen.The development was described by Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, as “a staggering blow to press freedom in Cambodia”.In less than a year, Cambodia has gone from having the freest press in the region to being one of the most repressive and dangerous places to be a journalist. In the 2018 Reporters Without Borders press freedom index published last month, Cambodia dropped 10 places from 132 to 142, and the country’s independent press was described as being “in ruins”. This was echoed by the Cambodian Centre for Independent Media, which recently concluded that the “facade” of free press in Cambodia had collapsed entirely, with almost half of journalists reporting intimidation.Hun Sen’s all-out war on the independent media began in early 2017, as journalists found themselves followed and harassed by secret police and controversial commentators were arrested. Then, in September, the Cambodia Daily – which had been accused of a pro-opposition stance – was forced to close over a disputed $6.3m (£4.6m) tax bill. This was swiftly followed by the shutting down of the Phnom Penh office of Radio Free Asia (RFA), which produced some of the most popularly consumed reporting on human rights violations and illegal government activity. Overall, 32 radio station across 20 provinces that broadcast reports critical of the government were forced to close last year.And then on Saturday, the Australian publisher of the the Phnom Penh Post, Bill Clough, confirmed he had sold the newspaper to a Malaysian businessman, Sivakumar G, who owns Asia PR. While Clough claimed the Post’s editorial independence would remain intact, Asia PR’s previous projects include “Cambodia and Hun Sen’s entry into the government seat”. The timing of the sale, coinciding with the Post settling its much-publicised $3.2m tax bill with the government, has also raised alarm. Journalists in the country talk of the “complete obliteration” of its independent press. Speaking to the  from Washington DC, where he is seeking political asylum, Pheap voiced his sorrow. “Any journalist who writes the real situation of Cambodia, anything that the government doesn’t like, then they will do everything to intimidate or prosecute us, and make sure we do not feel safe in our own country,” he said. “Because of this I have lost everything.”Not long after the Cambodia Daily closed, Pheap found himself charged in court with “inciting crime”, relating to an incident where he allegedly encouraged people to support the opposition while reporting on the elections in Ratanakiri province last May. In early October he was forced to flee to Thailand to avoid a jail sentence, leaving behind his family.  Pheap says the accusations are entirely false and politically motivated, and in fact relate to his reporting on the government’s involvement in the illegal logging trade. “We told the truth but made the local authorities look bad,” he said. “This is the real reason we are being punished.”The climate of fear for journalists in Cambodia worsened in November when two former RFA reporters, Uon Chhin and Yeang Sothearin, were arrested and accused of “illegally collecting information for a foreign source”. They deny all charges but are still in jail awaiting trial. An Australian journalist has also been jailed on an espionage charge. The reason for Hun Sen’s rapid clampdown on the press appears directly linked to the upcoming elections on 29 July, and a suspicion the opposition were gaining too much support – an unpalatable prospect for a leader who has held on to power since 1985. Critics say that in a two-pronged attack on democracy in Cambodia, his solution was to demolish the independent press that gave a platform to criticism, and then dissolve the opposition, the Cambodia National Rescue party (CNRP), in October. Kem Sokha, the leader of the CNRP, is in jail charged with treason. “It’s a rapidly deteriorating situation,” said Shawn Crispin of the Asia branch of the Committee to Protect Journalists. “It’s clear that they now see a free media as a potential threat to their continued stay in power and this clampdown was pre-emptively timed for these upcoming elections. The cold hard fact is that there is a lot less news now coming out of Cambodia – they have been able to pull the curtain down on what was a very free media very quickly.” Crispin added that journalists no longer knew where the line was when it came to reporting on the government, and uncertainty over what could lead to charges of treason meant self-censorship had become the norm in the press.  While many Cambodia Daily and RFA reporters fled the country after the closures – 11 RFA journalists are in exile in Bangkok – some stayed and say they live in fear or are subject to daily harassment from the authorities. A former RFA journalist still living in Cambodia, who preferred to remain anonymous to protect his family’s safety, said he had not been able to sleep “for months”. In the months building up to its closure, RFA journalists knew they were under attack from the government – the office installed bulletproof glass and hard drives were taken home at night – but he never expected the station to be shut down.  “They are out for revenge for Radio Free Asia journalists because we reported the truth, and now there is no law here to protect us,” he said. “I don’t think you can say there is fully neutral or independent media left in Cambodia any more, because Hun Sen got scared he will lose the election. Even if you are brave enough to report the truth, editors will not publish it.”The biggest question is whether after a victory in July’s elections, Hun Sen will loosen restrictions on the media, though most are not optimistic. Ed Legaspi of the Southeast Asian Press Alliance said he felt the worst had been done.“The ruling party doesn’t need to do anything further to intimidate the media,” he added. “Unfortunately they have been very effective. Right now in Cambodia the government has the upper hand.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5325058944c25af852069a5acc8c75f527c375c9/0_43_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0895e1345e570bb0fc1cc556db4c851a","title":"qatar blockade unexpected new vision isolation","story":"Enforced isolation has given the emirate confidence to pursue a political and cultural rebootFor most of the past year the city-state of Qatar, the wealthiest peninsula on the planet, has been exploring the law of unintended consequences. The trigger for that came last June, when Qatar’s closest neighbours, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE, escalated a simmering disquiet about the Gulf state’s role in the region to implement a full land and air blockade.Overnight, planes and cargo ships heading for Qatar were erted, all diplomatic links were cut and Qatar’s sole land border, with Saudi Arabia, was closed. Even camels were not spared the politics – 12,000 Qatari animals were forcibly repatriated.The stated aim for the blockade – which came with a 10-day ultimatum of 13 unlikely demands – was a protest against what was seen as Qatar’s singular role in “funding terrorism” (the Saudi line that Donald Trump swallowed and retweeted whole). Politically, it seemed rather an attempt to humiliate the sheikhdom and call it to heel. In the event, something like the opposite of that expectation has unfolded.Far from destabilising Qatar’s ruling al-Thani family, resistance to the ultimatum has lent it an “us against the world” authority. Among the 313,000 native Qataris (in a population of 2.6 million) a cult of personality has grown around the youthful emir, Sheikh Tamim, whose idealised portrait now gazes across the Gulf from the steel and glass skyscrapers of Doha, and is almost ubiquitous in the back window of the 4x4s that cruise the capital’s six-lane corniche.Isolation has also, it seems, acted as a catalyst to Qatar’s long-term vision for itself. One of the inbuilt ironies of the richest per capita state on earth was that, ever since it discovered and exploited its vast natural gas reserves, there has been little native necessity to drive invention. The al-Thanis’ stated goal has been to create a erse knowledge economy that lasts beyond the gas reserves. As Sheikha Hind, younger sister of the emir, explained to me in Doha last week in a rare interview, money – and the incentive of capital projects such as the 2022 World Cup – solves only some of those skills shortages.“It is not a secret that we are a wealthy society and that maybe nobody even needs to work,” she said. “But knowing that you can contribute in developing your country, and allow it to become even more prominent, is something everyone feels pride in. If anything, the blockade helped that. We see a big opportunity to be self-sustainable.”Qatar’s modern nation-building aspirations were first expressed by Sheikha Hind’s parents. While her father developed the partnership with Iran that could exploit the natural gas fields, her mother, Sheikha Moza, established the multibillion-dollar Qatar Foundation in order to transform education, particularly for women. Sheikha Hind, 34, a mother of five herself, was one of the first beneficiaries of “Education City” and has for the past three years been chief executive of the Qatar Foundation.From the balcony of its offices you can see the glass and marble evidence of that ambition in the futuristic campuses of a dozen “partner universities” that radiate outward. Each was persuaded here for its particular expertise in building capacity that Qataris need: Georgetown for its programme in government, Texas A\u0026ampM for engineering, and so on.The newest addition to Education City is the stunning Qatari National Library, designed by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas: a huge, welcoming building in which book stacks rise all around a central area that includes an open theatre and cafe, like terraces on backlit hillsides. There has been no library tradition in the Gulf, so Koolhaas’s idea was to create a space that is immediately understandable. Fifty-one thousand Qataris have already taken membership and the children’s library has proved particularly successful. In the few months since opening, every one of the 150,000 books on its shelves has been borrowed at least once.Along with those silver terraces of books, at subterranean level, in what look like excavated catacombs made of Iranian marble, the library houses an expensively acquired collection of rare manuscripts and calligraphy relating to the Arab world. This collection has been assembled in the same acquisitive spirit in which the al-Thani billions have filled its IM Pei-designed Museum of Islamic Art: to establish Doha as the modern intellectual capital of the Arab world. Later this year a new National Museum, shaped as a series of giant intersecting discs, designed by Jean Nouvel, will add another dimension to that claim.There is a blatant “look at us” attitude in some of this, but also the message that the territory that Qatar aims to colonise is as much cultural as economic. The al-Thanis have made headlines buying blingy stakes in such global landmarks as the Empire State Building, Harrods and the Shard – and splashing out ostentatiously on the world’s most expensive paintings ($250m for Cezanne’s The Card Players) and footballers ($262m to bring superstar Neymar to Qatari-owned Paris St Germain). But they have also long realised that it is whoever controls the story who generally wields power.That principle was first tested 22 years ago when the then emir established and funded the Arab broadcaster al-Jazeera. The harsh journalistic light the television station has shone on the internal politics of other Arab nations (and the relatively soft focus it gives to Qatar) is at the heart of the current enmity and blockade. One of the 13 ultimatum demands of the blockaders was that the broadcaster be shut down.The Saudi-led outrage at al-Jazeera’s reporting and editorial stance deepened during the Arab spring, when the station (and Doha’s ruling family) threw its support behind the popular uprising, rather than the established ruling powers. This stance was seen as part of a wider pattern in which Qatar seeks to build power at home while fomenting dissent abroad, aiming to be all things to all people: keeping trade and diplomatic channels open to Israel while openly funding Hamas hosting the major American air base, al-Udeid, while giving support to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood offering to broker peace talks on Syria while giving refuge to known al-Qaida affiliates.The dean, Everette E Dennis, a distinguished observer of the fourth estate’s role in extending civil society in the former eastern bloc as well as in the US, had expected a fight over censorship when he came to Doha. He has found, he says, that “there has never been a single intrusion into what we teach and how we teach it – the full range of social issues that would be part of the conversation on an American campus are freely discussed here”.Initially, he found some unwillingness to challenge authority among the students,who come from across the region and beyond, but that quickly dissipated. He suggests that the gains of regular press freedoms have begun to be appreciated in Qatar (despite the fact that, since 2016, the authorities have blocked Doha News, an online outlet that offered more critical reporting of their actions).There has been learning on both sides, he suggests. The university has established the first system of press accreditation, for example, and lobbying from graduates of the programme has coincided with the establishment of a properly functioning government information office. That spirit of critical enquiry, he suggests, has also prompted the ruling family and its government to address international concerns, in particular over the shameful treatment of migrant labour in Qatar on capital projects for the World Cup. They have responded to concerns with a minimum wage and new policy over housing programmes and healthcare that have been given a qualified welcome by the International Labour Organisation of the UN.In the dean’s view the blockade has again accelerated this transparency. At the same time as it has become illegal in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE for citizens to question or criticise even the idea of the blockade, Qatar is lifting visa restrictions and attempting to brand itself as a home of greater free speech. While Saudi Arabia congratulates itself on finally allowing women to drive, Sheikha Hind can point to a majority of female undergraduates across all departments, including engineering, at Education City.In that sense, I wonder if the Qatari ruling family is secretly grateful for the blockade in sharpening a perceived cultural ide between itself and its Wahhabi neighbours. Has it proved more an opportunity than a crisis?“I won’t lie to you and tell you we are OK with the blockade,” Sheikha Hind says, “absolutely not. We have had students here who are terribly affected by it – whole families have been torn apart. It is a sad situation we are in.” She hopes, along with every other Qatari I speak to, that there is a resolution to the conflict soon. Still, she says, “if anything, the push we always had here for self-sustainability is just exploding now.” The goal has not changed, she suggests, “but now we are running rather than walking”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9e801d7fd8a832272ef4ab0d9f8088383448346/0_0_2493_1496/master/2493.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=462b2bd81538d3f28c005768bec2a0a2","title":"thai activists claim victory over luxury housing on forest land","story":"Government bows to protesters and agrees to shelve development near Chiang MaiEnvironmental activists in the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai claimed victory on Sunday after the country’s military government agreed not to continue the development of luxury property on forest land. The decision follows a demonstration in Chiang Mai last week in which more than 1,000 people protested against the construction of a luxury development earmarked to house judges in the foothills of the Doi Suthep mountains. The demonstration was one of the largest since Thailand’s junta took power in a 2014 coup. It was also one of a growing number of anti-government protests, including in Bangkok, that are putting pressure on the government before a general election planned for early 2019. Green ribbons symbolising the environmental movement have appeared in public places in Chiang Mai, including on lamp posts and on cars, over the past week. The Thai prime minister, Prayuth Chan-o-cha sent Suwaphan Tanyuvardhana, one of his senior officials, to Chiang Mai on Sunday to talk to protest leaders. “We have concluded that no one will be living in this housing estate,” Suwaphan said after a meeting with the activists. The area “will eventually be restored to the forest”. he government would form a committee with activists and representatives from the local community to determine the future use of the land currently under development, which includes 45 houses, he said.A decision will be taken later this week, but construction of the homes already under way would have to continue for the government to honour its agreement with the construction firm involved. Activists hailed the decision as a victory. “What we have now is a promise that Doi Suthep forest will be restored,” said Teerasak Roopsuwan, one of the movement’s leaders. “I think this could be a model for other parts of the country that public projects must not only be legal, but they must also consider local people’s opinions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d7aab1b33b857ce8ce1526be3b41cfa5783c122/0_717_2252_1351/master/2252.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b9cbc44294d344c4d5f70323d863b87","title":"turkey fresh military actions kurdish militants erdogan syria iraq","story":"Operations in Syria and Iraq will continue, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan says at election manifesto launchThe Turkish president promised new military operations against Kurdish militants along the country’s border in Syria and Iraq as he presented his election manifesto.Speaking in front of thousands of supporters in Istanbul, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan described next month’s snap presidential and parliamentary polls as a “milestone” for a strong Turkey. The country would “take the stage as a global power”, he vowed.Erdoğan called elections for 24 June, more than a year earlier than planned – a move analysts say partly aims to capitalise on nationalist sentiment, which is running high after a successful campaign to oust Syrian Kurdish militia from the Syrian border enclave of Afrin.“In the new term, Turkey will add new operations to the Euphrates Shield and Olive Branch operations,” Erdoğan said in reference to a 2016 cross-border offensive in Syria and to the Afrin assault. “The operations will continue until not one terrorist is left.”The elections are hugely important as they will transform Turkey’s governing system into an executive presidency, a constitutional change that was narrowly approved in a referendum last year. As part of the changes, the office of the prime minister will be abolished, with its powers largely transferred to the president.An alliance of opposition parties, who argue the new system will lead to one-man rule, has vowed a return to a parliamentary system with strong checks and balances.Aiming to ease fears over Turkey’s economy, Erdoğan promised lower interest rates and inflation and to reduce the current account deficit.“The Turkish economy will be more resistant to outer shocks and financial blows. Turkey will be even more attractive to investors,” the president said.He added that Turkey had never abandoned its goal of European Union membership.Meanwhile, Muharrem İnce, the presidential hopeful nominated by Turkey’s main opposition Republican People’s party to run against Erdoğan in the presidential race, threatened to hold campaign events in front of television stations to protest the scarce media coverage of his initial election rally.With Turkey’s media largely controlled by the government or owned by businesses close to Erdoğan, opposition parties have complained of an uneven playing field.İnce, a 54-year-old former physics teacher known for his combative rhetoric, tweeted: “We will come to power by battling this media system. If this embargo on the opposition ordered by (Erdoğan’s) palace continues, we will hold our meetings in front of the television stations.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3486083.1525624346!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"parents kept in dark over primary teacher shortages staff say","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome primary schools which are struggling to cope with teacher shortages admit to using special needs support teachers to fill in for regular class teachers. File photograph: iStockPhotoPupils with special needs are among the most vulnerable of children in the education system.They require the support of resource teachers and, in some cases, special needs assistants to help reach their full potential.But many primary schools which say they are struggling to cope with teacher shortages admit to redeploying support teachers in order to fill in for absent mainstream class teachers.This, say education experts, is depriving children with special needs of vital supports and disrupting their education, which hinges on carefully planned routines.A survey published by the Irish Primary Principals’ Network indicates that almost 40 per cent of schools failed to find a substitute on more than 10 occasions in the previous year.The use of support teachers to take over mainstream classes was cited as one of the most common actions taken by principals.This is despite the fact that the practice is in direct violation of policies set out by the Department of Education.Principals, however, say they are left with no choice and need to keep classrooms functioning.And parents, for the most part, are kept in the dark because schools are reluctant to highlight these failings, according to staff who spoke to The .An acute shortage of substitute teachers at primary level has been well-documented over recent months.Schools report major problems finding teachers to fill in for short-tern absences, which is leading to split classes or the use of unqualified teachers. The impact on children with special needs has received relatively little attention so far.“On any given day, a principal has to make a choice: what causes the least amount of disruption?” asked the school principal of a small rural school, who declined to be named.“We have only one learning support teacher. Now my option for running the school during a staff absence is iding a class of 27 into other classrooms nine other students entering a full classroom is not physically possible. Or I can reassign a teacher to cover.“It’s not something you communicate with parents – the teacher shortages aren’t noticeable. In any other profession, be it a dentist or doctor’s appointment, if they cancel, you’re informed and it doesn’t go ahead.“But in schools, principals are trying to keep the school running. Keep the system going. What’s the other option? Tell 27 children and parents that school isn’t open today for them?“And I believe our role goes further than any circular. In the Education Act, principals are said to be responsible for ‘the day-to-day management of the school, including guidance and direction of the teachers and other staff of the school’.“To say principals should not act in this fashion is impossible, as we are the ones managing the school.”The practice of redeploying support teachers in this fashion is at odds with circulars issued by the department to schools.A spokeswoman for the department said there are strict rules “to prevent the misuse of special education resources”.The relevant circular states that schools should ensure that additional special educational needs teaching supports are used in their entirety to support pupils identified with special educational needs, learning support needs and additional literacy needs.“Additional teaching resources cannot be used for mainstream class teaching, or to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in mainstream classes, or to provide additional subjects for pupils who do not have special educational needs,” it states.A number of recent inspection reports conducted by the department, however, confirm this is happening.A department spokeswoman said: “If schools are not using their resources in the manner intended, this matter will be brought to the attention of the school and the school will be requested to immediately cease such practice.”She added that where there is misuse of these teaching resources, the department reserves the right to review allocations made to those schools.The National Council for Special Education, which allocates special education teachers to schools, said its position is that these teachers are additional supports and “principals have a responsibility to ensure that they are targeted at those students with the greatest levels of need”.The dilemma of sticking by vulnerable pupils with special needs or teaching the wider class can be wrenching for some teaching staff.One teacher spoke of feeling guilty over being asked to leave their own class.“It’s not a decision any school takes lightly, but it’s just total chaos,” the teacher said.“We’ve had two teachers absent this week and there has been no learning support. The guilt and stress when you’re not seeing your groups for support is immense. Kids who need that one-to-one attention. And it’s the same kids that are getting affected by this.“And for the other class teachers, they are now dealing with children who can’t access material inidually in an overcrowded situation.“When our school has absences and there are no subs, we have to use learning support because sometimes we don’t have the furniture or space to even split classes across the school.The teacher says some staff are “petrified of becoming ill” because of the impact on the wider school.“You see teachers work through sickness so as not to cause these kinds of decisions having to be made. So you have sick teachers working through, and becoming more and more ill, eventually having to take longer off.“Again, it’s back to that feeling of guilt all schools are suffering through just to stay open.”Teachers’ unions understand the difficult position many principals and teachers find themselves in.“Schools are dealing with the current substitute shortage in a variety of ways,” says John Boyle, former president of the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation“These include engaging a qualified teacher where available, engaging a second-level qualified teacher and asking or begging a retired colleague to step in and fill the vacancy.“Schools also try getting a student teacher to cover, splitting classes among other mainstream classes, asking a special education teacher to cover and when all else fails asking an unqualified person to cover to ensure the safety of the pupils,” he says.“While it is not the default position of a school to ask a special needs teacher to cover absent colleagues,” Boyle says, “principal teachers will go to many lengths to try and get qualified teachers for cover.”The department points out that it is recruiting more new teachers than at any other point in the history of the state, with more than 5,000 additional teachers recruited in the last two years.However, it says a specialist group is considering the issues that are impacting on teacher supply and demand and is overseeing a programme of actions to tackle them.They include boosting the number of teacher training places, restricting career breaks and attracting retired teachers back into the classroom.The INTO maintains that these measures do not go far enough and says issues such as two-tier pay, supply panels and other measures are needed to make any decisive impact.A failure to get to grips with the situation risks compromising the primary education of all pupils, including those with special needs, the union says.“Where people with no qualifications are engaged all pupils can lose out but this can have a greater impact on children with special needs.”“It is the INTO’s view that it is not possible to aim to have the best education service by 2026 while there is no capacity in the system to cover teacher absences which are among the lowest in the public service.”“This current shortage was predictable given the worldwide teacher shortage. It can be rescued through supply panels and completing pay equalisation” Boyle concludes"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3485898.1525609846!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"head of hse to leave post on july 1st government minister confirms","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMr O’Brien’s contract as director general of the HSE had been due to expire at the end of July.The head of the HSE Tony O’Brien is to leave his post at the beginning of July, a Government Minister has said.Mr O’Brien has faced strong criticism in the wake of the cervical screening controversy with Sinn Féin set to table a motion of no confidence in him in the Dáil this week.Mr O’Brien’s contract as director general of the HSE had been due to expire at the end of July.However, Minister of State at the Department of Health Jim Daly said on Sunday that Mr O’Brien would be leaving a number of weeks earlier than anticipated. Mr Daly confirmed to RTÉ’s The Week in Politics that Mr O’Brien will now leave his post at the start of July, a month earlier than had been expected.“That is correct, yeah,” Mr Daly said. “He is taking some leave that has accumulated in his favour so he’ll be leaving a bit earlier.”Mr Daly also said a new HSE board should be in place by next January. Vicky Phelan, the terminally-ill woman whose legal action revealed the smear test scandal, has repeatedly called for Mr O’Brien to resign.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said bringing forward Mr O’Brien’s departure by a number of weeks was not satisfactory.She said Mr O’Brien availing of his holiday entitlements was hardly an adequate or appropriate response to the current debacle over cervical cancer screening. She said if the Government was not prepared to hold the director general of the HSE to account when something had gone catastrophically wrong, then all its promises of change and reform in the health service was just talk.Fianna Fáil TD and chairman of the Oireachtas finance committee John McGuinness said Mr O’Brien should go immediately. “I believe that Tony O’Brien should resign with immediate effect,” Mr McGuinness told RTÉ.“I do not think he should have the opportunity to dictate the time of his departure”, he added. In recent days Ministers have avoided expressing confidence in the HSE chief, while Opposition figures have called for him to resign or be sacked. At the Oireachtas Health Committee on Wednesday, Mr O’Brien rejected calls from several TDs to step down.Tánaiste Simon Coveney declined to express full support for Mr O’Brien on Thursday. “Tony O’Brien’s focus on providing as much information as possible and putting systems in place that can co-operate fully with that independent investigation is probably the best way that he can assist in this process, rather than stepping aside from it,” Mr Coveney said.

Photograph: Getty ImagesPresident Michael D Higgins will have history on his side if, as expected, he seeks a second term in the Arás. Speculation is mounting he will be an agreed candidate, running unopposed. No sitting president seeking re-election has been opposed since Tom O’Higgins, a Fine Gael TD who later became chief justice, challenged Fianna Fáil’s Eamon de Valera in 1966. When Fianna Fáil’s Dr Patrick Hillery made himself available for a second term in 1983, he was not also opposed. Similarly, when Fianna Fáil’s Mary McAleese sought a second term in 2004, having prepared for an anticipated election, she was returned unopposed. There is a growing consensus that the various political parties will endorse President Higgins if he seeks a second term. He is guaranteed the support of his old party, Labour, who nominated him in 2011.With an election due in October, he is scheduled to announce his intentions in July.“Michael D is regarded as unbeatable if he goes again,’’ said one long-time Leinster House observer. There are other factors such as the absence of high-profile candidates among the other parties and, critically, the cost involved, which can be anything up to €500,000.Given that a general election could happen at any time, and there are European and local elections due in the summer of next year, cost is a critical consideration. Although the importance of the office, particularly its symbolism, is not being underestimated, there is little talk about it in Leinster House.The fragility of the Fine Gael-led minority Government, with the possibility of an election at any time, and next year’s elections dominate political discourse. Four Ministers – Eoghan Murphy, Charlie Flanagan, Simon Harris and Richard Bruton – recently publicly backed President Higgins for a second term. While Sinn Féin is publicly talking about contesting an election, some TDs are privately not so sure. They view consolidating the party’s position, with the aim of participating in government, as the priority for new leader Mary Lou McDonald. There is always the possibility of an Independent candidate putting his or her hat in the ring. Independent Senator Gerard Craughwell has indicated he will contest the election, and said he was confident he could secure the required support of 20 Oireachtas colleagues to get a nomination. However, that might be more difficult than he thinks. A number of Independent Oireachtas members are saying privately they will back President Higgins if he runs again. Mr Craughwell’s chances in an election, if it happens, are being dismissed in Leinster House. President Higgins, as an outgoing president, can nominate himself. If there is a contest it is unlikely to be as isive as 1966, when strong Civil War rivalries still existed between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. It was also the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Rising, with Mr de Valera that last surviving commandant. Although he should have romped home, he just about made it, securing 50.5 per cent of the vote against Mr O’Higgins’s 49.5 per cent, with a majority of just 10,000. Fergal Tobin, in his book The Best Of Decades, Ireland in the 1960s, described it as the most intriguing election of the decade. “O’Higgins ran a splendid campaign, presenting himself as a man of a new generation, best suited to the changed times,’’ he wrote. “The Presidency is not an office to attract political promises, but O’Higgins stumped the country, pressed the flesh, and conveyed the vague idea that he would somehow strip away the patina of remoteness and formality associated with Áras an Uachtaráin.’’Tobin wrote that Fianna Fail became sufficiently worried about Mr O’Higgins to engage in “old-style mud-slinging’’. Speaking in Cork, the then Fianna Fáil minister for lands and the Gaeltacht, Micheál Ó Moráin, said that for a time it appeared no candidate would oppose the president. But The , he claimed, had spoken, demanding that Fine Gael oppose the president. “We all know The  is the mistress of the Fine Gael party, and mistresses can be both vicious and demanding,’’ Ó Móráin added. Tobin noted that Mr O’Higgins went to Swinford in Mr Ó Móráin’s native Mayo to reply. “I do not know that The  is the mistress of our party, and I certainly do not know anything about the vicious demands of mistresses,’’ said Mr O’Higgins. “On these questions, I bow to the superior knowledge of Mr Ó Móráin.’’"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3485811.1525537135!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i struggled with knowing who ann s baby s father might be","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnn Lovett: died after giving birth at the age of 15, in 1984.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3485774.1525617266!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"russian opposition leader alexei navalny released","story":"Police carry Alexei Navalny by the arms and legs out of Moscow’s Pushkin Square.

Photograph: AP PhotoThe leader of mass protests against Russian president Vladimir Putin that resulted in the arrests of more than 1,500 demonstrators across Russia has been released from detention but faces two charges. Alexei Navalny said on Twitter on Sunday that he had been released after he was arrested during a rally in Moscow’s Pushkin Square on Saturday. He said he faces charges of organising an unauthorised meeting and of resisting police. Each of those charges can carry a jail sentence of 15 days. Mr Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner who is Mr Putin’s most prominent rival, has already served several multi-week stretches in jail on similar charges.OND-Info, an organisation that monitors Russian political arrests, said at least 1,575 people were arrested in demonstrations in 26 cities against Mr Putin’s upcoming inauguration for a new term as president. It was not clear on Sunday how many remained in custody. Police seized Mr Navalny by the arms and legs and carried the thrashing activist from Pushkin Square, where thousands gathered for an unauthorised protest. Police also used batons against protesters who chanted “Putin is a thief” and “Russia will be free”. Demonstrations under the slogan “He is not our czar” took place throughout the country, from Yakutsk in the far northeast to St Petersburg and Kaliningrad on the fringes of Europe. Amnesty International called the arrests and beatings of some of the protesters “outrageous”.The protests demonstrated that Mr Navalny’s opposition, although considered beleaguered by officials and largely ignored by state-controlled television, has sizeable support in much of the country. “I think that Putin isn’t worthy of leading this country. He has been doing it for 18 years and has done nothing good for it,” said Moscow demonstrator Dmitry Nikitenko. “He should leave for good.” Moscow police said about 300 people were detained in the capital, state news agencies said, and there was no official countrywide tally. In St Petersburg, police blocked off a stretch of Nevsky Prospekt as a crowd of about 1,000 marched along the renowned avenue. Mr Putin is to be inaugurated for a new six-year term on Monday after winning re-election in March with 77 per cent of the vote. Mr Navalny had hoped to challenge him on the ballot but was blocked because of a conviction in a case that supporters regard as falsified in order to marginalise him. Mr Navalny has called nationwide demonstrations several times in the past year, and their turnout has rattled the Kremlin. – Associated Press"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Growing signals that US may withdraw from agreement Donald Trump has called \u0026lsquoworst ever\u0026rsquoBuild-up of methane gas is blamed for blasts at two separate sitesAnother coalition government of most parties that have ruled since 2016 is likelySeveral \u0026lsquofirsts\u0026rsquo in the Middle East country\u0026rsquos first parliamentary election in nine yearsPalestinians gather for sixth March of Return protestMahmoud Abbas suggests Jews not persecuted on religious grounds, but because of their conductWashington risks conflict with Russia and Iran, President Assad\u0026rsquos chief backersDrive to push out terror group was halted in January when Turkey began Afrin offensiveEleven children killed in further attack on foreign forces in south of AfghanistanThrough the dark days of the 1990s civil war and the Taliban\u0026rsquos oppressive rule, Shah Marai never left his countryAction by human rights groups follows deaths of 44 protesters on Gaza borderMove comes in wake of unclaimed missile strikes on Syrian air bases on SundayUS secretary of state reassures Riyadh that US will abandon Iran nuclear deal if talks failResidents have been staging protests since March seeking right of return for refugeesAs he was snatched from his village by Islamic State, Jano\u0026rsquos mother handed him a piece of paper that would save himDonors\u0026rsquo conference clocked just over half of the \u0026euro6.5bn needed to help Syria in 2018Ahmed Abu Hussein worked for Al-Shaab radio and had protective vest marked \u0026lsquoPress\u0026rsquoGovernment U-turn after no African country willing to accept migrants on Israel\u0026rsquos termsHassan Rouhani says US president lacks qualifications to assess nuclear dealDamascus Letter: Residents alternate between \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquowar normal\u0026rsquo lives"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3485889.1525607651!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup leader insists free flow with the republic possible after brexit","story":"DUP leader Arlene Foster has insisted Northern Ireland does not need to stay in the customs union after Brexit to achieve what she described as “free flow” with the Republic.

That was our position as well.” Photograph: Dave MeehanDUP leader Arlene Foster has insisted Northern Ireland does not need to stay in the customs union after Brexit to achieve what she described as “free flow” with the Republic.The former first minister of Northern Ireland, whose party props up the British prime minister Theresa May’s minority government, called on the European Union to engage in a “pragmatic” manner as talks about the UK’s departure from the bloc continue.“I think it’s very clear that the British people voted to leave the customs union. That was our position as well. We don’t believe that we have to stay in the customs union to have free flow between ourselves and the Republic of Ireland,” Ms Foster said. “We believe that there are ways to deal with this and indeed back in August of last year, as you know, the Government put forward various proposals.“We were disappointed there wasn’t the engagement from the European Union at that time. They were dismissed out of hand if you like. And what we would like to see from the European Union is less rhetoric and actually more engagement in relation to a pragmatic way forward, not just for Northern Ireland but for the whole nation as well.”She was speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. Ms Foster was described as the “real leader of the Conservative Party” by another guest, the British Labour Party shadow chancellor John McDonnell.He said: “What we have said very clearly, and I think actually quite a lot of the Conservatives are going to follow us in this, we remain within the customs union during the transition period, we want to negotiate a customs union, that will solve the Northern Ireland border problem, which I think is intractable.”Mr McDonnell said there “will be movement from the EU” towards the Labour position. As well as the customs union plan, “we want to get as close to the single market as we possibly can”, he said.Meanwhile, Mrs May has insisted she had the “determination to deliver Brexit” as she came under pressure from both wings of the Tory party to change course.Eurosceptics urged Ms May to drop the proposal for a “customs partnership”, which they fear would tie the United Kingdom too closely to Brussels.But pro-EU Tories pushed for Ms May to abandon her red lines and keep the United Kingdom in the single market, claiming she would have cross-party support in the House of Commons for such a move.Elsewhere, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also risked unrest within his party over Labour’s position on Brexit ahead of a Lords vote on the issue.Writing in the British Sun On Sunday, Ms May said she had an “absolute determination to make a success of Brexit, by leaving the single market and customs union and building a new relationship with EU partners that takes back control of our borders, our laws and our money”.She said the United Kingdom was “making good progress towards that goal and we will carry on doing so with resolution in the months ahead”.A decision on the Government’s preferred customs option has been postponed after Mrs May’s Brexit “war cabinet” failed to reach agreement.A number of Cabinet ministers spoke out against the Ms May’s hybrid “customs partnership” model that would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods destined for the block, with firms potentially claiming back a rebate if products remained in the United Kingdom on a lower-tariff regime.The Sunday  quoted a Cabinet source saying it would be “unimaginable for the prime minister to press on with the hybrid model after it has been torn apart by members of her own Brexit committee”.However, pro-EU Tories, seeking to capitalise on the lack of agreement in the Cabinet and a Lords victory on the customs union, pushed for Ms May to abandon her Brexit strategy and instead commit to a Norway-style approach within the European Economic Area (EEA) and European Free Trade Association (Efta).Such a move would be unacceptable to many Brexit supporters because it would leave the United Kingdom expected to accept free movement, although its advocates claim Ms May would have some ability to impose conditions.A Lords amendment that would require the Government to negotiate continued membership of the EEA could be put to a vote on Tuesday, but Labour peers have reportedly been told to abstain.Labour’s Lord Alli, one of the signatories to the amendment, accused the party leadership of being “paralysed by indecision”.He told the Observer: “This is complete cowardice. There is no point in being in politics to abstain, If you stand in the middle of the road someone is going to knock you over.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"prince louis pictured at three days old","story":"Pictures of Prince Louis’s first days at home — including a snap of the British baby royal being cuddled by his big sister — have been released by their parents.The newest member of the royal family, born on April 23rd, was photographed by the duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace when he was just three days old.Louis is pictured in a white outfit propped up on top of a white frilly cushion on a seat at the family residence in London.A second photograph shows Louis receiving a kiss from his sister Princess Charlotte, taken by their mother on May 2nd, Charlotte’s third birthday.Louis appears to be sleeping soundly, as Charlotte puts a protective arm around her baby sibling and plants a kiss on his forehead.The palace said the duke and duchess of Cambridge, William, and Kate, were “very pleased” to share the photographs, adding: “Their Royal Highnesses would like to thank members of the public for all of the kind messages they have received following the birth of Prince Louis, and for Princess Charlotte’s third birthday.”The duchess, a keen photographer, bucked tradition when she took the official photographs of her newborn daughter in 2015.A history of art graduate, she has released pictures to mark other milestones in her children’s lives. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/05/TELEMMGLPICT000162388207_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq7aytLzvMMfvyoYe1n9J4aPKnxiBOC-Ttvtxh1Wl2WOc.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"passengers compare scene inside caribbean cruise ship titanic","story":"Deck 9 on the Carnival DreamThe scene on board a cruise ship in the Caribbean drew comparisons to the Titanic as 50 staterooms on Deck 9 were flooded.A breach in the Carnival Dream\u0027s fire extinguishing system led to water pouring into a corridor.One passenger said people had been relocated to the spa to sleep on yoga mats.Marla DeAnn Haase, a passenger, posted images of the flooding on Facebook .She wrote: Um....FB folks.....this is a rare moment of internet connection ....we are flooding on a cruise, we heard the violins and the silverware all came crashing down.

reduced to tears as she underwent brutal training.Mobile phone footage of the incident was uploaded to Facebook and has been viewed more than 300,000 times.It shows a corporal subjecting the distraught trainee to a torrent of verbal abuse during a bayonet exercise.After wading through a stream, the recruit was summoned before the instructor, who repeatedly yells that she is “f------- weak” and demands to know whether she is a killer or a mouse.She is marched towards a pile of sandbags which represent the enemy and ordered to attack them but is chastised for her efforts.The corporal then feigns sympathy and asks why she is crying before he launches another attack and says she is “nowhere near the end”.It comes just weeks after the Army launched a new “softer” recruitment campaign targeting a broader base, which emphasises that it is okay for soldiers to cry.The mobile phone footage, which names the recruit, has been mocked up online to mimic one of the Army’s new adverts, branded with the slogan “This is Belonging.”Lord Dannatt, the former head of the Army, said the instructor\u0027s behaviour was “totally unacceptable.”He told the Mail on Sunday: “I hope the identity of the corporal is discovered very quickly and that he is removed from the Army at the earliest possible moment.“Tomorrow would be a day too late.”Johnny Mercer, the Conservative MP who as an Army officer fought in Afghanistan, said bayonet training had to be brutal but criticised the instructor’s decision to record the exercise, which was a “deep breach of trust and respect for that

Colin Rose\u0026#39s design was inspired by a compassA sculpture towering above both Nelson\u0027s Column and the Angel of the North has been planned in honour of the Queen\u0027s reign of the Commonwealth.Landowner Lord Devonport, or Terence Kearley, 3rd Viscount Devonport, hopes to build the 60m (196ft) Elizabeth Landmark in Kirkwhelpington, Northumberland. The retired architect and philanthropist, who has spent years regenerating his Ray Demesne estate near Otterburn, believes the structure will boost tourism.Despite not knowing how much the project will cost, Lord Devonport, who has not yet sought planning permission, commissioned three artists to design competing structures.The winning sculpture will be taller than the Angel of the North at 20m (65ft) and Nelson\u0027s Column at 52m (170ft) and sit on his estate between the A68 and A696, atop Cold Law hill, outside Northumberland National Park.Lord Devonport hopes his proposed Elizabeth Landmark will boost tourism in some of the nearby rural communitiesThe three artists are Colin Rose, from near Alnwick, Peter Evans from Newcastle and Simon Hitchens from the West Country. Public exhibitions will be held later this month at which residents and other interested parties will be asked to give their views.Curator Matthew Jarrett, who helped to select the artists, said the proposed sculpture would stand 60m high. Simon Hitchens proposal was inspired by the rugged landscapeLord Devonport said the project was in honour Queen Elizabeth II, who he considers an inspiration and has a great admiration for.He said: This is a celebration of shared values, of a connected global community in what is an increasingly fractured world.The Commonwealth is a unifying force, led by Queen Elizabeth II.Peter Evans, from Newcastle, wants his structure to move with the landscapeThe final design will be announced in spring 2019 and funding for the long-lasting sculpture will not come from the public.He said: Without knowing yet the artist who will be chosen to take the design forward, we can’t know the cost of the creation of this sculpture, but we do know that we want to create a proud monument that will celebrate our Queen for hundreds of years to come.Please review our commenting policySecrets of the looted Iraqi treasures that could reveal a lost city Put GPs in gyms to tackle Britain\u0026#39s obesity crisis, say health expertsSmart cling-film stop shoppers getting lost in the supermarketArmy corporal faces disciplinary proceedings over mobile phone footage of exhausted recruitComment: As the Duchess of Cambridge has demonstrated, hand-me-downs are as much about nostalgia as thriftBBC sexed up Woman in White to swap \u0026#39odious corpulence\u0026#39 of fat Count Fosco for \u0026#39boyband\u0026#39 heartthrobHarry and Meghan\u0026#39s wedding rules: no phones, no gifts, no swordsUK weather: Hay fever sufferers warned of \u0026#39perfect storm\u0026#39 on Bank Holiday MondayPakistan\u0026#39s interior minister shot and wounded in \u0026#39assassination bid\u0026#39Speedo\u0026#39s daring Racerback swimsuit that caused moral outrage is to go on display at the V\u0026ampAFemale police officer sues Met for £200,000 after having to watch 100 child rape videosIndia arrests main suspect in gang rape-murderMillennials are turned off sex, study suggests, with one in eight still virgins at 26 Benjamin Netanyahu: Better to confront Iran sooner than later Stormy Daniels issues warning to Donald Trump in comedy sketchPrincess Diana\u0026#39s family to play key roles at Royal wedding – with her sister Lady Jane Fellowes to give readingRoyal wedding guest list: Who did Meghan Markle and Prince Harry invite?What will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsPilot forced to make emergency landing on Devon beach We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/04/09/paris-68-1.jpg  width= 564  height= 423  alt= paris-68-1.jpg  title= paris-68-1.jpg","title":"may 1968 paris student riots demonstrations sorbonne nanterre de gaulle","story":"Fifty years ago today the streets of Paris staged a battle between 6,000 student demonstrators and 1,500 gendarmes – within days it had snowballed into civil dispute that saw 10 million French workers go on general strike and brought the economy to a virtual halt.\u0026nbspAndreas Whittam Smith recalls the events of ‘Mai 68’The French always celebrate 1 May with a few riots. They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They are making a big decision as to where the next motor plant should be in Europe.“We have a very successful one in Deeside, in North Wales, but there are choices as to whether that should be located on the continent. “Between that plant and the plant in Derbyshire there are 3,500 people employed. The nature of that business is that over 50 per cent of the parts come from out of the country. They come through every hour of the day and night ... It’s just in time manufacturing. It is highly efficient. “What we have always said is we will have a customs agreement that has the minimum of frictions. Now that is crucial.”Tory rebels: We can push May towards single market, if Labour backs usBank of America moving 125 UK jobs to Ireland because of Brexit ‘Manual workarounds’ plan over fears IT systems not ready for BrexitBrexit blamed for weak services growth in AprilMs May’s customs plans will help firms as it would mean you can import parts without border checks or paperwork, he said.Mr Clark added: “But it’s not perfect, because what it means is that if we have imports from other countries where we’ve abolished the tariff, there has to be an arrangement where you pay back.”He also opened the door to extending a transition period on customs with the EU, saying it could be a case of implementing a new customs arrangement “as soon as you can do” rather than 2020 when the transition would expire.It could take until 2023 to put new infrastructure in place, he added.Former home secretary Amber Rudd, who resigned last week over the Windrush scandal, immediately tweeted her support of Mr Clark’s plans.Business leaders also welcomed Mr Clark’s comments, saying it was important to maintain the status quo on frictionless trade until a new arrangement is in place.However Mr Rees-Mogg, chairman of the powerful European Research Group (ERG) of Tory Brexiteers, said it would be “odd” for Ms May to back a policy that effectively breached her commitment on leaving both the customs union and single market.He told ITV’s Peston on Sunday: “This Project Fear has been so thoroughly discredited that you would have thought it would have come to an end by now.“We trade successfully all over the world.

I was told there’s no need to see anyone or a specialist\u0027Katie Holley was jolted awake by a cold thing – what she had initially thought was a small piece of ice that somehow slid down her left ear. Still disoriented, she rushed to the bathroom, grabbed a cotton swab and slowly stuck it inside her ear. And then Ms Holley felt something move. It was like a “rhythmic” movement, she recalled, as whatever it was tried to burrow deeper into her ear canal.She pulled out the cotton swab and saw small, dark brown pieces that looked like legs.Cockroaches have been a nuisance in the Holley household since she and her husband, Jordan Holley, bought their first home last year, she wrote in Self magazine this week. They thrive in warm and damp places and that includes Florida, where the young couple live and where flying cockroaches called palmetto bugs are most common. Households in warm cities, such as New Orleans, Houston and Atlanta, report more problems with cockroaches than much of the country.Woman discovers cockroach in Air India loungeWhite House infested with cockroaches, mice and ants, documents revealDoctors find live cockroach in woman’s skullA few weeks earlier, an exterminator sprayed every room inside the couple’s house in Melbourne, Florida and Ms Holley felt what turned out to be a very temporary sense of relief.That morning, around 1.45am on 14 April, Mr Holley rushed to the bathroom to help his panicking wife, grabbed a flashlight and looked inside her ear. And there it was, a small part still visible from the outside as it stayed there, lodged in the middle of the ear canal. Mr Holley managed to pull out a couple of legs using a pair of tweezers, but the intrepid bug had crawled too deep.The young couple drove to the emergency room just a few miles away. A man sitting behind a desk near the hospital’s entrance saw the look of panic in Ms Holley’s face and asked whether she was in pain.“A roach crawled into my ear while I was sleeping and it was stuck,” Ms Holley said she told him.She was given a wristband and taken to a room, where she lay on her side on a gurney, whimpering. A nurse injected the bug with the anaesthetic lidocaine to try to kill it. Ms Holley said she felt the roach move, twitching and wriggling further into her ear as it tried to avoid death. Two minutes later, it stopped moving.It took the doctor about 20 seconds to pull out chunks of the dead roach and Ms Holley saw what she thought was the remains of a small insect. She left the hospital nearly two hours later with a prescription for antibiotics and ear drops, relieved that it was all over. She and her husband vowed to never let the experience happen again, stopping by a Walmart to buy earplugs.Nine days passed, but Ms Holley’s ear still did not feel normal. It was still numb, she said and she felt some discomfort every time she yawned. Her medicine drops also had stopped passing through her ear, leading her to think that perhaps earwax had built up inside.She went to her physician for her regularly scheduled appointment and asked the doctor whether she could check her ear. Her doctor and a physician assistant flushed her ear four times. Using an otoscope, they peeked inside and there it was – another leg.Lord of the butterflies: Clive Farrell has turned his Dorset estate into an insect-filled fantasiaLord of the butterflies: Clive Farrell has turned his Dorset estate into an insect-filled fantasiaMs Holley’s doctor pulled out six pieces of the roach’s remains – but feared there was still more left. Ms Holley said her physician arranged for her to see a doctor who specialises in treating the ears, nose and throat (ENT) later that day.As she went home and waited, Ms Holley tried to remember how much of the roach was taken out at the emergency room more than a week ago.“Did they find the head? Antennae?” she wrote. “I couldn’t recall. But I could only hope that the ENT would only need to remove another teensy leg or two.”The specialist placed what looked like a microscope next to Ms Holley’s face. A few minutes later, she felt something bigger was getting extracted out of her ear canal. And then she saw it. Not a “teensy leg or two”. Not the remains of a baby roach. But a head, a torso, limbs and long antennae of what looked like a fully grown palmetto bug.For nine days, much of the dead roach sat in Ms Holley’s ear.“I was furious. I was really disappointed with the ER for not having seen that, for letting me believe it was all out,” Ms Holley, a 29-year-old sales and marketing manager, said on Saturday. “They said this is something that happens often. I was told there’s no need to see anyone or a specialist.”Scientists create robotic cockroach to search disaster areasHolley declined to name the hospital she first went to in April.Holley said she did not have any permanent damage or infection. Palmetto bugs generally do not bite and if they do, their bites are not harmful.Cockroaches have been known to burrow into people’s ears. A South African hospital, for example, pulled two dozen critters out of people’s ears over a period of two years, according to a National Geographic article published last year.“Roaches are searching for food everywhere,” entomologist Coby Schal of North Carolina State University told National Geographic. “And earwax might be appealing to them.”But, still, as Ms Holley said: “It was still a roach. In my ear.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account? Log inWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is predicting a G1 geomagnetic storm this weekend, which may make the Northern Lights more visible than usual in some parts of the US.Scattering of electrons behind northern lights observed for first timeIt’s also one of the last times the lights will be this intense for more than a decade. That’s because the sun – which produces the particles that cause the lights – is entering a period of lower activity known as “solar minimum”. Sightings of the lights will be much less frequent during this period, according to experts.Below is all the information you need to make the most out of this viewing opportunity.Light show: Aurora Borealis in NorwayThe Northern Lights glow over a hut near the town of Kangerlussuaq in GreenlandNorway is on top of the world for Northern Lights visitors - start in the former capital, Bergen, one of the world\u0027s most dramatic harbour citiesChurchill perched on Hudson Bay in Manitoba, is the self-styled \u0027Polar Bear capital of the world\u0027. The polar bear migration takes place in late October and November, which means that you can combine a wildlife experience with the chance to see the aurora borealis.The Northern Lights occur when gaseous particles in the Earth\u0027s atmosphere collide with charged particles from the sun\u0027s atmosphere. The molecules then become excited, causing them to glow.The different colours of the display are caused by different molecules: Oxygen causes the yellow, red, and green lights, while nitrogen causes the blue and purple ones.Because the earth\u0027s magnetic field line pulls the solar particles toward the poles, the northern lights are most often seen within a few hundred miles of the magnetic north pole, which includes places like northern Scandinavia, northern Canada, and the northern coast of Siberia.A woman sits on a pier to watch northern lights on the Lofoten Islands, in Bostad, in the arctic circle in northern Norway (AFPGetty)Fan of the Northern Lights might be able to see the display from some areas of the US this weekend, thanks to a solar storm headed towards Earth.The NOAA Space Weather Prediction Centre is predicting a G1 (Minor) geomagnetic storm this weekend, caused by the sun ejecting about a billion tons of superheated plasma into the atmosphere. These types of storms often cause solar flares, causing the aurora borealis to shine brighter, and making it visible from areas farther from the pole.And no, the solar storm won’t hurt you.Northern Lights dazzle in USThough it’s not guaranteed, the anticipated magnetic storm could make the lights more visible from northern US states like Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and Wisconsin.The Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, however, is predicting the lights will only be visible as far south as southeast Alaska.Generally, the best time to see the lights is in the evening, when the sky is dark. Experts recommend anywhere between 9.30 pm and 1 am local time as optimal viewing hours.Before heading out, however, it’s best to consult with an online predictor like those run by the Geophysical Institute or NOAA to see when the lights will be most active in your area.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Spring has been unusually warm the hillsides above Beirut are green and the pink and purple blossom of bougainvillea and jacaranda trees drift down onto the city’s streets.  The plethora of new political flags and posters, however, is definitely more eye-catching.  On Sunday Lebanon’s erse population of six million will cast their votes for the first time since 2009 in a national election which should end almost a decade of political gridlock.Lebanon Prime Minister Saad Hariri says resignation on hold awaiting talksThe new elections come with a set of complicated new rules designed to move Lebanon towards a proportionally representative system for the first time, allowing space for more independents and reducing the power of establishment blocs formed by the country’s multiconfessional political system.Critics, however, say that since the new electoral law asks voters to pick lists of allied sects and parties, as well as prioritise inidual candidates on the list of their choice, it accentuates the already isive tendencies of Lebanon’s complex politics by making candidates on the same slates compete with each other. “Like almost every law on the books in Lebanon, the way it looks on paper is very different to how it is applied or fairly administered in practice,” said Imad Salameh, a professor of politics at Beirut’s Lebanese American University. “We are injecting into the normal proportional system this Lebanese twist. Parliament is unlikely to change too much. But it is a step in the right direction.”Lebanon’s politics – which involves 18 officially represented sectarian groups – is famously complicated. The filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesThe filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesIn the Christian villages just below the cedar forests of north Lebanon’s Tannourine, huge posters of the Christian president, Michel Aoun, are currently hung underneath tens of Shia Hezbollah’s distinctive yellow flag, green fists brandishing AK-47s.  Some of the country’s more surprising political partnerships – such as that of the recently elected Mr Aoun and Lebanon’s Sunni prime minister, Saad Hariri – say a lot about how Lebanon’s internal politics are still intrinsically linked to its position in the region and the Middle East’s wider power struggles. Lebanese media has been dominated in recent weeks by pundits angry that the country’s biggest issues – the heavily indebted economy, the disarmament of Hezbollah, Syrian refugees and crises in public services such as electricity and garbage – have for the most part been sidelined by the major parties, who are too preoccupied with forging allegiances to maintain the status quo to assure voters they will do what’s best for the country.Analysts believe that the reaction of Iran and the administration of US President Donald Trump – both of which have proxy interests in Lebanon – will depend on other events across the region.“The problem is, the Trump administration and Iran will treat the election results depending on so many other factors,” said Mohaned Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre. US pledges support for Lebanon’s army after Israeli ‘Hezbollah’ claimPiles of rubbish wash up on Beirut beach amid national waste crisisThe Boustani house encompasses both the tragedy and faith of LebanonSaudi Arabia has threatened Lebanese stability in the past“There’s so much happening in May in the region alone. We will still be counting the votes, probably, when Trump pulls out of the Iran deal, and Iraq holds its own elections, which may change a lot in the Shia power balance there. “Our future is dependent on many variables outside our control.”The rest of the Middle East casts a long shadow on the tiny country. Internally, so do ongoing rows over gerrymandering, conflicts of interest, party funding and the steep cost for independents for running a slate.Despite all that, however, there is still a sense of optimism among many young people in Lebanon – 800,000 of whom are excited to cast a vote for the first time. Art exhibition in Lebanon shut down by people trying to erase imperialism from their historyA record number of women are running this year and civil society movements aimed at educating people about their democratic rights are flourishing. “The best way of looking at these elections is: they are an exercise for the new blood in Lebanese politics and new candidates and movements popping up everywhere to try contest the sectarian establishment and elite,” said Mr Ali. “It is building up some sort of new independent movement for the next round. It’s a long process, and there’s a long way to go.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Margaret Thatcher sent two aircraft carriers – HMS Hermes and HMS Invincible – to help take back the Falklands in 1982.They were accompanied by an array of British destroyers, frigates and subs. A new £3.5 billion HMS Queen Elizabeth carrier is nearing the end of its trials and a second HMS Prince of Wales is still under construction.But critics claim at least ten more escort ships are also needed. Challenged yesterday, Sir Mark signalled the intention was only ever to use both carriers as part of an international taskforce when they are operational.Speaking to MPs on the cross-party Defence Committee, he said: “We will see what happens in the circumstances but that is part of the thinking about the use of the carriers“It is projecting them as a British sovereign capability but one that will almost inevitably - I would actually say inevitably - be used in a context of allied operations of some kind if used in a contested environment.”Lord West said it was clear the Government need to “put its money where its mouth is”. “I have always said we should have 30 escorts – indeed that number came out of the Strategic Defence Review in 1998. We have 19.”He stormed: “There may well be an occasion where we have to do something on our own. We would cobble together whatever taskforce we could. But we haven’t spent enough on escorts.”Downing Street last night insisted that Britain’s Navy did have enough ships.A spokesman said: “We are clear that our aircraft carriers are a sovereign capability and that we have the ships to allow them to deploy independently.“What the National Security Adviser was saying was that we are a member of Nato and have close defence relationships with allies and so such a scenario is unlikely.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vibrant metropolis, at ease with its diverse, tolerant self.A shining example to the world of how folk from different backgrounds and cultures can rub along together.At least, that’s what we’re invited to believe. But the truth is this depiction of our capital city is not one recognised by millions of its citizens. That’s because London is, in fact, a tale of two cities.There are the gentrified hotbeds of liberal cosmopolitanism — the Islingtons and Camdens — top-heavy with the professional classes and cultural elites, the type of areas that were a bedrock of Remain support in the EU referendum.But then there are those places outside the bubble. On the one hand the grittier, traditional working-class areas — the Canning Towns and Bermondseys — populated by those steamrollered by globalisation, for whom austerity and mass immigration have exacerbated the problems of low wages, poor housing and under-pressure public services.On the other, the middle-class suburbs — the Upminsters and Eastcotes — inhabited by those who sense that their “small c” conservatism is increasingly incongruous with the image of their city as a beacon of progressive modernity.It is between these places that a new and unintended coalition has emerged, born out of resentment at having  to watch their old-fashioned, socially conservative — what some describe as “faith, family and flag” — views shunned and disparaged by the liberal elite.You can see something similar writ large across England: An accidental alliance between once-loyal Labour voters in the post-industrial towns and Conservatives in the shires.It’s an alliance which manifested itself most starkly in the Brexit vote.For the Londoners that fall within these groups, their city is not the harmonious and cohesive ideal seen through the eyes of the chattering classes.It is, instead, a place increasingly atomised, where millions feel a diminishing sense of belonging and in which entire communities within a few hundred yards of each other live utterly parallel lives.Take, for example, the borough in which I grew up, Barking and Dagenham.As working-class as it gets, it was once the very essence of a traditional Labour heartland. Never affluent, but stable, close-knit and settled.Centred around a sprawling 1930s council estate and with generally healthy levels of employment — the dominant Ford factory being at the heart of local industry — Barking and Dagenham enjoyed its steady constancy, its social and cultural familiarity.For those short on money and opportunity, the concepts of place, belonging, identity and relationships take on so much more meaning.But then things changed. Over a few very short years, around the turn of the century, there was a sizeable influx of migrants, precipitating rapid social and cultural transformation.The demographic convulsions meant stable, settled Barking and Dagenham found itself in the eye of the storm of the debate over mass immigration.The indigenous population cried out for respite. The letters page of the local paper was filled with correspondents begging to be heard. But nobody in power took a blind bit of notice, other than to patronise them with trite arguments about improved GDP and cultural enrichment.Rather than rally to their support, the Left — including, shamefully, the Labour Party and trade unions — treated these marginalised working-class folk like an embarrassing elderly relative, imploring them to “stop blaming migrants” (something they hadn’t done in the first place).What was genuine bewilderment and disorientation on the part of local citizens was, inexcusably, dismissed as casual racism and bigotry.Yet it wasn’t their sense of race that had been violated by the sudden upheaval in their community. It was their sense of order.So, in 2006, locals took the only route of protest they thought left available to them and returned  12 British National Party councillors at the local elections.The noxious far-Right, which previously had never gained a foothold in the borough (though it had penetrated areas close by) now formed the official opposition on Barking and Dagenham council, not because thousands of locals had overnight turned into vile racists, but because they had repeatedly been ignored by a tin-eared establishment.But even then, nothing changed. Locals were told to get with the zeitgeist.Women in their eighties who had lived in the borough for most of their lives, had raised  families there and in many cases now lived a life of lonely isolation, were told to embrace the vibrancy of the new multiculturalism.That was the level of condescension to which the liberal establishment had sunkSo thousands of people simply upped sticks and left. In the first decade of the new century, Barking and Dagenham experienced a vast exodus of families who had been rooted in its streets, workplaces and  institutions for generations.It was the only home that many had ever known, but they went all the same. They departed for the Essex coast or Kent. It wasn’t “white flight”, for skin colour was irrelevant to most of them.It was, instead, a flight to familiarity.The tragedy was that most of these people never were anti-immigration. They would not have objected to the integration of a modest and manageable number of arrivals over a reasonable period.But the whole debate around immigration has been toxified by what the ruling elites imposed on places such as Barking and Dagenham.They shook a kaleidoscope then stood back in surprise when the pieces didn’t fall exactly where they wanted. Remember all this the next time you hear someone speak of London as the greatest city in the world.Chances are the words are being spoken by a politician or a celebrity or a middle-class liberal from one of the trendier parts of town.For there are, in reality, two Londons. One half — alienated, neglected and resentful — represents a potentially formidable army at the ballot box.Who will speak for it?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the customs partnership idea, which would involve the UK collecting tariff revenues on the EU’s behalf, would make the UK a much less attractive country to do trade deals with.To be fully effective, it would also  require the UK  to essentially copy all EU regulations on goods.With the scheme also leading to the European Court of Justice getting involved in Britain’s affairs, it would not be “taking back control”.But even after the remarkable rebuff it received from the Brexit inner Cabinet on Wednesday, despite the Prime Minister putting her authority on the line by making clear her support for it, No10 won’t give up on the idea. It believes that, with a few changes, it can be made to work.Ministers are now bracing themselves for a huge effort from Theresa May’s allies to get them to change their minds.Already, No10 is telling ministers that what really matters is getting out, and that once the UK is no longer a member of the EU, all these problems can be ironed out at a later date.I understand that one minister has even been warned that the whole Brexit project might collapse without a customs partnership.The argument is that there is “no deal” without a customs partnership, which the Government views as being  key to solving the Irish border question.Without a deal, Parliament could turn on Brexit.The Chief Whip has also told Cabinet colleagues that he hasn’t got the votes to defeat a customs union amendment in the Commons. So, the best way to see that off is to embrace a customs partnership instead.But the local election results show that the Tory vote is becoming more and more Leave dominated. Number crunchers estimate that 70 per cent of Tory voters are leavers.As one influential Tory warns, this means that if Mrs May loses Brexit Secretary David Davis or Boris Johnson from the Cabinet over the customs partnership “and is seen to be selling out Brexit, the Tories will be utterly screwed electorally”.Another problem with the customs partnership idea is the message it sends the EU.As one insider tells me: “The EU is trying to force us into a false choice between a customs union and no deal — and we’re encouraging that by not being clear enough in our negotiating position.”Rather than trying to pressure ministers into backing her customs partnership idea, Mrs May should tell the  EU she wants a free trade  deal with sensible customs arrangements that keeps red tape to a minimum.Once she has been clear, she might find the EU more willing to negotiate.THE country is there for the taking. The local election results show neither Labour nor the Tories are able to break the political stalemate.If these results were replicated at a General Election, we would have another hung parliament.It is easy to declare that the country is permanently split, and that’s why no party can win a big majority. But I don’t think that’s right.Rather, the problem is that neither Labour nor the Tories are capable of reaching out.If Labour was led by a working-class leader from the Midlands who stood up for the country, then they would be on course for a proper majority. Equally, if the Tories were led by a Brexiteer whose upbeat, optimistic vision could appeal in Remain areas then they would be beating Corbyn comfortably.  Indeed, these local election results suggest that Labour under Corbyn has stalled – that it hasn’t kept up the progress it made in last year’s General Election.Now, Labour are highly unlikely to change leader before the next election.Jeremy Corbyn and his allies have seized control of the commanding heights of the Labour Party, and the new members who so fervently believe in him wouldn’t back a challenge to him whatever Labour MPs do.But the Tories will almost certainly change their leader before 2022. These results are a reminder that they need to show  they have delivered on Brexit by the time of the next election. Government whips have been calling round to ask Tory MPs what they think of handing the  NHS a funding boost on its 70th birthday in July, and how they would pay for it.These results suggest they would be well advised to portray this money as the beginning of the Brexit dividend for the health service.This might stick in the craw of Tory Remainers, but  voters now expect them to deliver on Brexit promises.When the Tories pick their new leader they need to go for someone with cross-over appeal – someone who can firm up their support among Leave voters but reach out to Remainers too.I am told that Bercow, who is currently under pressure over bullying allegations, doesn’t feel   he can say this publicly. But I am assured that this is his plan. It remains to be seen whether the knowledge that Bercow will go  will curtail calls for him to quit.Many in the Commons feel  the claims against him must be properly investigated if Parliament is to show  it is serious about protecting its  staff. Senior figures in Government are also keen to see the back of  him because they suspect him of encouraging Labour’s use of an arcane procedural device – “a humble address” – to try to winkle embarrassing information out of ministers.PENNY MORDAUNT presented to Cabinet on the gender pay gap this week.She turned in an assured performance less than 24 hours after being appointed minister for women and equalities, telling ministers to demand a plan to close the gender pay gap from the sectors covered by their department.But as one female Cabinet minister points out, no one mentioned the elephant in  the room – the fact that the second most senior woman  in the Cabinet had to quit  her job, only to be replaced by a man.Only five of the 23 full members of the Cabinet are women.  The Government might want to concentrate  on improving this balance before they lecture business any more.PHILIP HAMMOND and Michael Gove are clashing over the powers of the post-Brexit environmental regulator.The Environment Secretary wants it to have the  same power to hold the Government to account that the European Commission  has.  But the Chancellor is sceptical. Senior Treasury figures tell me he does not think it is sensible or necessary to continue these restraints post-Brexit.The dispute is causing some raised eyebrows. One Whitehall source describes it as part of the “constant war” between the pair.  The two obviously disagree on Brexit.But Hammond is also deeply unenthusiastic about Gove’s green agenda.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My periods of time off for the birth of each of my three children were 12 weeks, nine weeks and 13 weeks because I could not afford to take longer off unpaid.She later told how in 2001, when pregnant with her first child, she was called by somebody running the news rota saying as they couldnt find cover she was needed for cover on her due date.Ms Gosling, who felt vulnerable being pregnant without a staff job, agreed.Then while heavily pregnant with her third child in 2007 she received an email from bosses saying they wished to sever her contract and start a new one once she returned, at a cheaper rate.Earlier she told tribunal judges how she felt she had no choice but to set up a company in order to continue presenting for the BBC.Gosling, David Eades and Tim Willcox are challenging income tax and national insurance demands from Her Majestys Revenue and Customs (HMRC) officials at a specialist tribunal hearing in London.The dispute centres on terms of employment.

I have osteoarthritis and cannot work. If I have to buy new school shoes, I decide what bills I can’t pay.I shared a bed with Emilia for more than two years and in that time I barely slept. Every time she moved, I’d wake up and it took me hours to get back to sleep. In November 2017, I was referred to the charity by my support worker.Within days, I received a message about a bed that was going to be delivered. The charity was a lifeline for me and Emilia.I know so many families in need – one friend puts her three children to sleep in a single bed each night. Children shouldn’t be living this way.Thankfully Emilia now has the space to dream. Without Buttle UK this wouldn’t have happened.FOR 18 months, Sylvia Johnson, 35, woke up in the morning to find her youngest son Daniel, 11, lying on the floor in a sleeping bag.His big brother, Quentin, 13, would be curled up on the sofa, groggy and irritable after a terrible night’s sleep.With no money to replace her two boys’ broken beds, Sylvia – who suffers from rheumatic pain and cannot work – felt like she was not doing her job properly as a mother.Sylvia, of St Austell, Cornwall, says:MY children had third-hand beds that became unbearable for them. So Quentin felt happier sleeping on the sofa, while Daniel chose to sleep on the floor.He’d pile cushions on top of one another to make it more comfortable and fell asleep in a sleeping bag. Quentin was angry and irritable and the two of them would argue all the time because they were so tired.Both are bright and their schoolwork suffered. They were constantly late for school and Quentin started to take time off because he was so exhausted. His mood suffered and he started to get depressed.Every night, I was so stressed. I didn’t know where Daniel was going to sleep – the chair or the floor? I knew I had to tell someone but I was scared and felt like I wasn’t doing my job. I worried people would judge me or take my kids away.But I was losing my mind so I told the school and was referred to the charity in June last year. I know people take having a bed for granted but sleep is so important to a child’s health and education.Now with their new beds, Quentin is in the top set for maths, science and English.My sons have their own space and don’t argue anywhere near as much.It’s not shameful to need help and to ask for it. Some people think there’s no such thing as poverty in this country but they have no idea.This gift has changed our lives. Because someone was willing to help me and not judge us, I’ve been able to ask for help in other areas of my life.SINGLE mum Emma Ross couldn’t afford to replace her sons’ bunk beds when they broke last year.Emma, 38, was forced to share a bed with her sons Daniel, 13, and Christopher, six, for four weeks, while daughter Emily, 11, slept in the room next door. The barber, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, says: WHEN we moved house last November, the boys’ bunk beds got damaged. When you’re a single parent who works part-time, you allow for day-to-day expenses but not that kind of money.The three of us slept in my bed for four weeks and it was a nightmare.Daniel was grumpy when he woke up and teachers started to notice how tired Christopher was at school. I couldn’t tell them the truth so I just said he was going to bed too late.Daniel moved in with my ­parents until I was able to sort out a new bed. I got in touch with Buttle UK and they delivered new bunk beds within four weeks.I felt as if a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. The kids were over the moon and now wake up fresh for school.MUM-of-one Siobhan Flynn, 32, shared a bed with her nine-year-old son Joseph for almost a year after she could not afford to replace his broken one.Siobhan, who lives near Rochester, Kent, says:JOSEPH has autism. Sometimes I don’t think he knows why he doesn’t want to do something and he finds it hard to verbalise his needs. He had barely slept in his own bed when it broke in August 2016. It was poorly made and uncomfortable, and Joseph refused to sleep in it.I’d ask him questions and jokingly say, “Even Superman sleeps in his own bed,” but he found it difficult to be there alone. The company refused to replace his bed and wanted to send an engineer to check if there was a fault. But I was worried they would tear it apart and leave it in a worse condition, so I refused.I didn’t have enough money to buy another so Joseph ended up in bed with me. It was hard. He’d hog the covers and I’d always end up with no space, with either an arm or leg thrown over me, and it affected our sleep.Joseph finds it difficult to go to sleep at a normal time and usually drifts off around midnight. It doesn’t matter if I read him a story, put him in his pyjamas or give him a nice bath, Joseph reminds me of a mobile phone battery. He’s not going to switch off at 25 per cent, he needs to wind down completely. He is often tired at school and has fallen asleep in class but I can’t force him to go to sleep.It was almost a year living like this before I applied for a new bed and mattress – and I don’t know what I would have done ­without the charity’s help. Perhaps I’d still be in the same position because £400 for a new bed and mattress is a huge amount of money to me.There were no other options. Nowadays, Joseph still doesn’t sleep in his own bed as much as I would like.He doesn’t like being alone and hates the dark but it’s important he feels ­independent. Knowing he has his own safe and secure bed to sleep in is a huge relief. Kids need breathing 7 space of their own.THERE are three ways to get involved with our Beds for Kids campaign – and YOUR support will make all the difference.FOR every bed or mattress bought from Dreams Beds stores across the country, one will be donated to Chances for Children.READERS can also donate directly to the charity through the Beds for Kids page at mydonate.bt/charities/bedsforkids or via your Sun Savers wallet.YOU can also buy a copy of the specially created book, That’s No Place To Sleep.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was so miserable I even contemplated ending it all.“I’ve given up on my dad and the pain that he causes and I’m starting to build a life for myself.”In a heartbreaking interview, Taylor-Ann, a delivery driver, reveals how “Rocket” Ronnie has seen her just ten times in 21 years, despite living just TEN miles from her in Essex.She also told how Ronnie, who is worth £8million, cut her £1,000-a-month maintenance payments after accusing her of treating him like a cash machine — and claimed he branded her a “cokehead”.He also offered ZERO help in her recovery, even though Ronnie checked himself into rehab in 2000 for drug and alcohol addiction.That lack of support left Taylor-Ann hurt and bewildered.She said: “I thought of all the people in the world he would understand better than most how I struggled with depression and how I’d turned to drink and drugs.People had helped him recover and forgiven him but he was clearly writing me off.”Growing up, Taylor-Ann saw very little of Ronnie, who last weekend crashed out of this year’s Snooker World Championships in the second round.Taylor-Ann’s mum, Sally Ann, discovered she was pregnant just weeks after an acrimonious split with Ronnie in 1996.Taylor-Ann says: “When I look back our relationship was tragic. I used to google my dad when I was little. I’d screen-shot pictures of him and compare them to ones of me to see if I resembled him. I was desperate for his attention.“I haven’t watched him play since I was four. He promised he’d wave to me from the telly and I watched a whole tournament just waiting for my special wave. It never came and I was heartbroken.”But with no real understanding of her dad’s true character, Taylor-Ann was not prepared for the blow that sent her life reeling in 2013, when she was just 17.She explained: “I’d got a place at college to do business studies. As it was too far to commute my mum helped me find a flat. I was thrilled. I loved the course and got distinctions in the first year. I was so excited about telling Dad so I met him in a cafe.“I told him Mum had transferred the £1,080 per month maintenance he paid to her into my bank to cover my rent, bills and college fees.“He seemed a bit surprised. He raised an eyebrow and said, ‘That’s what you use it for?’ I hit back, saying, ‘I just want my dad’.“He smiled and nodded. I asked him to stay in touch. I remember saying a phone call every couple of months would be plenty. It was pathetic, really, looking back. But then I had no idea what was about to happen.”She claims that after dropping her home, Ronnie severed all contact and immediately stopped the payments.She said: “He’d stopped paying the court-ordered amount. I couldn’t believe it, especially when he knew it was covering my rent and college fees.”Unable to pay her rent, Taylor-Ann lost her home and was forced to drop out of college — before the courts had time to order Ronnie to cough up the arrears. He later resumed the payments — but the damage had been done.Taylor-Ann said: “I became depressed by what had happened and started drinking heavily to forget how miserable I was. I lost my driving licence for speeding, my job, and doing cocaine became a regular thing.“To be honest I didn’t really care. I just wanted to blot out the pain my dad had caused. Several times I thought about just ending my life and the whole sorry mess.”Taylor-Ann, from Redbridge, Essex, claims she had no contact with dad-of-three Ronnie, who is now dating Holby City actress Laila Rouass, 46, for years before texting him in 2016.She said: “I hadn’t called him or spoken to him for three years. It felt like we were finally building bridges“I wasn’t even sure of his number but just sent a text saying, ‘Hi Dad’ and he replied, ‘All right mate’. Even that was difficult. I didn’t want to be his mate, I’m his daughter.“To be fair, we did have a long chat on the phone a few days later. We caught up on everything that had happened to both of us. He sounded like he cared then.“We talked a couple more times on the phone over the next few months. It felt we were finally building bridges.”They even went out for a Thai meal last March with his children from another relationship Lily, now 12, and little Ronnie, ten.She said: “It was lovely to see my brother and sister. I really love them and am happy and grateful that they have a better relationship with their dad than I do. I confided in Dad about my problems.“He offered to pay for me to re-take my driving test and get my licence back. He could see how touched I was by the offer and even said, ‘Look, it’s not just you I ignore when things get difficult — I do it to Lily when she gets demanding’.“I think he was trying to make me feel better — in a clumsy way. I was grateful and managed to ask why he’d stopped paying my maintenance the year before.“His reply stunned me. He said, ‘You know Taylor-Ann, I’ve gone through life with people treating me like an ATM machine. Why should I keep paying? What do I get out of it?’”She found Ronnie’s hard love a shock and was more confused when he sent her a text that night. She said: “He sent me a really lovely message. He said he was proud of me for recognising my problems and attempting to deal with them.“I immediately forgot his harsh words earlier and was so delighted that he’d said he was proud of me. It was one of the few times he’d paid me a compliment in my life.”But the relationship took a terrible turn when Taylor-Ann — who had still not kicked her drug issue — went on a night out with a mutual friend of Ronnie’s.During a cocaine binge, the friend told Taylor-Ann her dad had warned the rest of the family to sever all ties with her. She said: “I was so hurt, so upset. I had no idea whether it was true. At some point the person I was with rang my dad and started having a go at him.“She had the phone on speaker and I heard my dad say, ‘You pair of cokeheads need help’.“I just broke down and sobbed because he obviously wasn’t going to help me. I tried to contact him to explain but it seemed he no longer wanted to know.”A few days later — in March last year — a broken Taylor-Ann checked into a rehab centre for cocaine addiction. But she claims at no point did her dad visit, call or even message to ask how she was.Just days after coming out of rehab she landed a new job at a car parts firm, where she met her boyfriend — and father of her child — Naihan Chowdhury, 21. The pair are now sharing a one-bed flat in Romford, Essex.Taylor-Ann, whose baby is due in October, said: “We don’t have a lot but we have everything a baby needs — two parents that love it and want to cherish and care for it.“Naihan is the same age as my dad was when I was born, but I already know he’s going to be a better dad than Ronnie ever was because he’s here and helping. I wish Dad had been there for me but he wasn’t, all I ever wanted was his love. I’ll make sure we learn from all the mistakes he made with me.”Ronnie declined to comment on Taylor-Ann’s claims.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We work aggressively to ensure that we do not have terrorists or terror groups using the site, and we also remove any content that praises or supports terrorism.Our approach is working – 99 per cent of ISIS and Al Qaeda-related content we remove is found by our automated systems. But there is no easy technical fix to fight online extremism."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403689862.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john bercow likened harvey weinstein black rod","story":"A former House of Commons official says the Speaker had “stepped over the line”.Mr Bercow is resisting calls to step down over bullying allegations which he denies.Former Black Rod David Leakey — who worked with him — said: “John Bercow is not an altogether bad Speaker.

Darcy Norgate, 19, said she was shocked when her local MP Michael Fabricant replied to her with the swear word for female genitalia. The row began with a tweet on Friday afternoon in which Mr Fabricant, 67, said Labour had failed to meet expectations in Thursday\u0027s local elections and it had been a disappointing day for the party. Ms Darcy replied: Not as disappointing as Burntwood since you neglected it. Mr Fabricant hit back: Says a complete tw*t who seems unaware that there is no vote this year in Burntwood!

It wasn’t until the singing began that everyone let their emotions run free. It’s what gets to people most and gives them a cathartic release. I was close to her and remember thinking, ‘If I can get through that, maybe I can do this for other people.’  I did a music degree, performed on cruise ships in my 20s, and taught singing before I became friends with my now-business partner Briony. We’d sing together just for the love of it. I told her about my idea and, in October 2015, we put together a website and contacted local funeral directors.  We didn’t know if anything would come of it, but a few months later we got a call and the first funeral we did, we just sang some hymns to support the congregation, as a lot of people aren’t used to singing in church. It felt a bit surreal, like, ‘Hang on I don’t know that person in the coffin,’ but it’s a privilege to be there and to learn about the person, corny as that sounds.  I found it nervewracking to be in front of an intimate gathering of people – I’m way more nervous in front of two people than a thousand – but the fact I’m there to help them helps me perform better and keeps my nerves and emotions in check. It’s not about you, it’s about someone else.   The hardest thing we’ve had to do was sing at a stillborn baby’s funeral. There were just the parents and grandparents in the church and they were holding it together so well, so beautifully. The dad read a poem he’d written for his son and then we sang Bright Eyes and Amazing Grace. I saw a single tear come from the mum’s eyes then they all broke down and cried. Another voice does tend to be the point when the barriers come down.  We also did a lady in her early 20s who was given a strict Catholic service where we sang Ave Maria and that was tough, and of course the congregation was huge for someone so young.  We also do some wonderful, unusual, services. I did a fantastic one for a lady who spent the first half of her life in the Jewish religion and the second as a Buddhist, and the service was in a treehouse in the woods.  There was 10 minutes of Buddhist chanting followed by a rabbi who sang Hebrew prayers, then we sang For Good from Wicked, which is such a moving song, particularly because of the line ‘I’ve heard it said that people come in to our life for a reason’.  We were asked to bring some West End glamour so we dressed up for them, and it was wonderful because the whole thing felt like it encapsulated her personality. For the majority of services, we wear concert dress, erring on being overdressed.  It gets competitive  We do a lot of funerals for travellers as well. When we got the call for our first one I didn’t know what to expect, especially as the leader of the clan turned up in sunglasses and covered in bruises – I don’t know what had gone on there! He got there very early to go through everything including our singing, so he listened to all our rehearsals – not something that ever normally happens – because everything had to go perfectly.   Travellers take being in church seriously and, of course, it’s a proper occasion, with about 300 people, though they don’t tend to be as crazy as the weddings. We are often there mostly to get the congregation going, as travellers don’t know the hymns, the organ starts and they’re self-conscious and don’t know what to do – though we’ve also been asked to sing solos of everything from A Thousand Years by Christina Perri, to Perry Como songs.

And Nestle-owned Blue Riband chocolate biscuits, made in Britain since 1936, are set to be made in Poland with the loss of nearly 300 jobs. Swiss firm Nestle claims the switch, affecting jobs in Newcastle, York, Halifax and Girvan in Scotland, will help the firm stay competitive.  But unions have blasted such moves. And GMB national officer Eamon O’Hearn says centuries of tradition are being swept aside in pursuit of profits. He said: “Multinational companies are playing fast and loose with their ties to the UK. Unilever is selling off the Colman’s site for redevelopment. “Norwich is losing nearly 200 years of production and more than 100 jobs. This whole policy is driven by profit. “British firms have a strong philanthropic tradition, with Colman’s setting up schools and Cadbury building facilities for its workforce and communities. All that is being ripped to shreds.” Nestle has made Smarties in Hamburg since 2006 while rival firm Mars moved Twix to France and Germany a year later. There has been a series of foreign takeovers of British brands in the past 20 years – with one of the most controversial being Kraft’s \u0026pound12billion Cadbury swoop in 2010. Kraft – now Mondelez International – closed a factory near Bristol where Wispa and Crunchie bars were made, and moved production to Poland. Curly Wurlys have been manufactured there since 2008.  Mint chocolate firm Bendicks, made by royal appointment since 1930, was moved from Winchester to Germany in 2011 after a buyout. Organic chocs Green \u0026amp Black’s has been swallowed by Kraft. It is now made in Italy as well as Poland where Twinings tea is produced along with Terry’s Chocolate Orange. HP Sauce was bought up by US giant Heinz in 2006 and moved from Birmingham to Holland in 2007. But Mike Watkins, retail insight head at industry analyst Nielsen, claims we’re not too bothered where brands are made. He said: “What’s important to shoppers is quality, price and convenience.” Nestle said its proposed changes “affect a number of our sites including Fawdon, Newcastle, where Blue Riband is made.” Unilever says most Colman’s products made in Norwich will stay in the UK. But some packaging of dry sauces will move to a German factory. Unilever said: “We will offer affected employees a comprehensive support package including discussing redeployment at other sites.” Brands that left the UK 1. Colmans  The famous mustard began production in Norwich in 1858. The firm became part of Unilever in 1995. The factory is due to close at the end of next year when production goes to Burton upon Trent and packaging of dry sauces to Germany. 2. Terry\u0027s Chocolate Orange  Terry\u0027s Chocolate Orange can trace its history back to 1769. Chocolate maker Terry’s of York was taken over by US-owned Kraft Foods in 1993, which closed its York factory in 2005. The chocolate oranges are now made in Poland as part of Mondelez International. 3. Green \u0026amp Black\u0027s  Organic chocolate brand Green \u0026amp Black’s, founded in 1991, was bought for \u0026pound20m in 2005 by Cadbury which itself was taken over by Kraft – now Mondelez – five years later. It is now made in Italy and Poland. 4. HP Sauce  The famous tangy brown sauce depicting Big Ben on the label was dreamed up in 1898 by grocer Frederick Gibson Garton who called it HP because he had heard a restaurant in the Houses of Parliament had begun serving it. It was bought by American giant Heinz in 2006 and production was moved from Birmingham to Holland a year later. 5. Blue Riband  Made in Britain since 1936. Thought to have been named after the Blue Riband trophy awarded to liners crossing the Atlantic in the quickest time. The chocolate wafer biscuit, made in Newcastle, is now moving to Poland. 6. Twix  Twinnings, which supplies tea to the Queen, was founded in London in 1706 and claims to be one of the first companies to introduce tea drinking to the English. Although its HQ is in Andover, Hants, where most of the tea is blended, unions fear the firm could move all of its manufacturing to Poland. 7. Crunchie \u0026amp Curly Wurly  Launched by chocolate firm Fry \u0026amp Sons in 1929, Crunchie bars were made at Cadbury’s Keynsham factory near Bristol until 2010 when the firm was taken over by US food firm Kraft.  Production of the bar moved to Poland along with along with Wispas and Curly Wurlys. 8. Smarties  The fun multi-coloured sweets were launched by Rowntree in York in 1937.

Nicola Gaskin fell pregnant with her baby girl Raven Rain, known as Ray, while grieving the loss of her first child Winter Wolfe with her husband Dean. Eight months following her daughter\u0027s birth, Nicola has spoken candidly about how her life fell apart in the wake of her son\u0027s death and the blissful relief that overcame her when Ray arrived.  The parents call Ray their little \u0027rainbow\u0027 because she represents the hope they had after losing their first baby, the Burton Mail reports.  Nicola’s world spiralled 14 months ago when her son Winter Wolfe died after living for just one day from heart complications.  Now she has spoken about how fund-raising, sharing her story publicly and now having another baby has shown her that there is life after loss. She says they will never forget Winter and feels that Winter\u0027s parting gift to them was his sister Ray. Nicola, 33, enjoyed a smooth pregnancy with Winter, but just 30 minutes after his birth, the tot stopped breathing and doctors and nurses spent the next 24 hours battling to keep him alive. Sadly at just one day old, Winter died in his parents\u0027 arms. Now Nicola has spoken of her and her husband Dean’s heartbreaking but eventually hopeful journey. She said: We were so happy in pregnancy and there was no sign of anything being wrong at all before he was born. I was a bit surprised by the whole thing and to be honest I think it is because I didn’t know much about baby loss before. I cringe about this now but I thought that if babies were going to be poorly you would already know they are poorly and then they are taken away and cared for.  I obviously knew during pregnancy that there are risks of miscarriage but there is this magic 12-week window people talk about and you think that when you have got past that you are all right. Despite her grief after Winter died, Nicola admits that she wanted to have another baby right away a common mindset among parents who have been through a loss, she said. Nicola said: To be honest I wanted another baby straight away. I spoke to the bereavement midwife at the hospital after Winter had died and I said I can’t wait. She said there are typically two categories that people who have lost a baby fall into they can’t ever imagine having another baby or they want another one straight away that is usually the two mindsets. A lot of people I know that have lost babies have gone on to want another baby afterwards and I think it is because you still want a baby and you have gone through everything and got nothing. For me I felt like that was nine months of effort and nothing to show and I needed to crack on because it could take another nine months and I still might not get another baby. It was a case of there being no guarantee and me having no time to lose. I think I knew that having a rainbow baby would be the only thing that would bring some comfort and Dean was very supportive and also wanted to try again.  I felt like it was the only way of having some hope. I lost Winter and then I felt all this emptiness where the excitement had been. I needed to fill that void within me. Nicola said she has always been very open about her experience and she learned very early on that there was no right or wrong way to carry on after losing a baby. She said: I didn’t struggle massively with talking to people. I know that some people do struggle to open up and it is difficult. I think because I was very vocal people found it easy to approach me. I found that people don’t always know what to say and it may be difficult but if you are going through loss then be thankful they are saying something, because it is hard for them too. Grief is going to last forever because love lasts forever so it is important not to put expectations on yourself to be over it. There isn’t a right or wrong way to grieve you just do what you have to do. Some people are very proactive in grief whereas others are more private and that is fine. It would be impossible to tick all the boxes and whether you believe it or not grief does change and becomes manageable in your day to day life. Despite her laid back approach, when Nicola became pregnant with Raven Rain, now eight months, she admits she was both overjoyed and really frightened.  Nicola, who is a teaching assistant at Lansdowne Infants School, in Burton on Trent, Staffs, said: We were both absolutely overjoyed when we found out we were expecting Ray but in between having Winter and falling pregnant with Raven I did have two early miscarriages. They made me a bit nonchalant about the pregnancy and I felt like although I was really happy and it was a step in the right direction, it was not a guarantee of a baby. I was frightened to celebrate the pregnancy and I almost felt like if I celebrated it then it would end, like if I allow myself to get too excited about it then it just going to be taken away from me. I didn’t buy any baby clothes for a long time because I was so frightened of buying more clothes that were going to be empty. With Winter I recorded the whole pregnancy and then he was born and he died so the next pregnancy I didn’t dare celebrate. I was very different with one of the babies I miscarried and I even declined a scan picture. I didn’t dare move and I would sit completely still on the sofa scared to do anything. But then I lost that baby and I thought, I did my pregnancies very differently but both ended in loss, so how you celebrate pregnancy is not related to loss. It is not something I did, it is something that happened to me. Luckily for Nicola and Dean, who is 32 and a store manager at All Saints in Nottingham, the pregnancy with Raven was a smooth one and they had to pinch themselves when their rainbow baby was born happy and healthy. Nicola said: We had no problems during pregnancy with Ray. I had a bit of sickness which was normal and we had to have lots of check-ups for heart complications that Winter had but luckily they were all clear.  When she was born we literally had to pinch ourselves. I just cried and cried and the emotions were crazy. We stayed in hospital overnight and the next morning when I woke up Raven was already older than Winter because Winter only lived for one day. That is very strange to have a baby and look at her thinking anything I have with her is already longer than what I had before with her brother. Every milestone is bittersweet. There is the first smile, sitting up for the first time, first food, trying to crawl, and you are overwhelmed with happiness but it is always in the back of my mind that this should be my second experience not my first. I think it is bittersweet. That is the word I would use to sum up this whole journey. Nicola said that the birth of her daughter made the grief of losing Winter easier to bear. She said: I definitely think that having Ray has made the grief easier to bear. It is something positive to come out of this and if I didn’t have her I would still just be grieving a baby. When she was first born I really struggled because it was very close to Winter’s second birthday but the good definitely outweighs the bad. There are 14 months between Winter and Raven but if we had not lost Winter I don’t think I would have tried for another baby so quickly. Without Winter, Raven wouldn’t exist - she is his parting gift to us.

Andy Perry, who almost died, is believed to be the first Brit to lose an entire leg from a spider bite. The 46-year-old had been working as a landscaper when he fell ill with severe back pain just 48 hours after a fencing job in Thorpe Astley, Leics. He had no idea he had been bitten on the ankle by Britain\u0027s most venomous spider until he was rushed to hospital suffering from sepsis and kidney failure.  Andy required emergency care, was placed on an IV drip and remained at Leicester Royal Infirmary for a week. Over the next few weeks the infection subsided but he was left with lymphedema - a painful and debilitating swelling of the leg, which left his skin falling off. He said the pain got so bad that he even considered chopping off his own leg with a chainsaw. After numerous appointments with specialists Andy opted for an elective amputation above his right knee, which was carried out in March. He has now been left wheelchair bound, unable to work or play with his children and needs daily treatment. Andy, of Huncote, Leics., who lives with his police officer wife Christine, 39, said: I was doing a quote for a job in 2015 and I was coming home at lunchtime to look after the kids because my wife was on shift.  But within a couple of hours I started feeling really poorly. I rang the missus to see if she could come home but she couldn\u0027t and the next I know I got a massive ache in the small of my back. That was pretty much me done then and Christine came back home when I called her again. I went to bed when she got back, pretty much for the whole weekend and I was throwing up. Then on the Sunday morning it was a question of having to get over to the hospital as soon as I could. I was seen by a doctor in the Royal Leicester Infirmary Triage and he said there was no chance of me going home.  Then he admitted me straight away, the ache in my back was the kidney\u0027s packing up from the infection and sepsis. I put on a IV anti-biotic and almost died because of the sepsis. Experts believed the false widow spider was to blame after daily blood test when a phlebotomist noticed two puncture marks on Andy\u0027s ankle. The doctor in charge deemed the bite to be from the false widow spider - as its bite has similar effects that Andy was experiencing. Andy added: It was the phlebotomist who did my daily blood test - he spotted these little puncture marks on my ankle. He said it looks like a spider bite, they then got the doctor in charge to have look and that\u0027s what they came to agreement on. They came to a conclusion it was a false widow spider because it has a reputation of biting people.  The puncture marks were just above the sock line because I used to wear socks and boots. The only thing we can think of is that I literally just brushed past it and its had a quick bite as I\u0027ve gone past. Apparently the bite of the false widow feels like a bee sting but I didn\u0027t feel a thing. He added: The spiders are an awful lot more common than people think. After they sorted out the kidney function, things started improving and the sepsis was beaten by the anti-biotics. I\u0027ve had the district nurses coming around for the next three months changing the dressing on my leg every day. The lymphedema caused the leg to swell to the point where the skin split and fell off. That was all just a massive open weeping sores and blisters and just generally horribleness.  At that point, Andy said, his leg was all but useless and he spent time trying to get treatment. He added: There just wasn\u0027t a surgeon nearby who wanted to touch it because of the lymphedema as it was a live infection. So without getting any treatment I just couldn\u0027t work - so I figured I would go down the route of elective amputation in a last desperate attempt to get back to work. But again trying to find a doctor or surgeon to look at the amputation was hard. Eventually I had to threaten my GP with cutting my own leg off with a blade from a chainsaw because I was getting so desperate. Out of that I tried a guy in Coventry who climbed on board straight away as soon as he saw the leg. Andy said he got a second opinion after the conversation and spoke to prosthetics specialists. His leg was amputated on March 13 this year, but he suffered a setback when he got a secondary infection, resulting in another surgery on April 27. He said: I\u0027ve now got a vacuum dressing on me which pulls all of the gulp out of the leg and takes it away.

Showing no evidence whatsoever of any sibling jealously, the photos (taken by mum Kate ) showed a tender moment between Charlotte and Louis, as the proud big sister gives the little prince a kiss.  The picture of Charlotte is similar to one Kate took of George holding his little sister a few weeks after her birth.

As many a parent knows, wrinkly hands and feet are normal with newborn babies, and soon plump out.  Prince Louis also appears to be wearing a second-hand ensemble from big sister Charlotte, as his outfit is nearly identical to one she sported in photos taken weeks after her birth. Charlotte was pictured in a blue cardigan which her older brother George (who was mysteriously absent from the photos) wore for a Vanity Fair shoot.

John Kinsella, 53, was the man shot dead while walking his dog in a secluded woodland alongside the M62 in Merseyside, the Liverpool Echo reports. The gunman is thought to have been on a mountain bike when he fled the scene near the Rainhill Stoops interchange on Saturday morning. Kinsella was once arrested in Amsterdam after fleeing the UK while under investigation for a robbery at a haulage depot.  In 2008, he was convicted for that robbery and the boxer and martial arts exponent, formerly from Everton, was handed an 11-year sentence for robbery, dangerous driving and skipping bail. During his trial, Kinsella admitted he was close to the scene at the time of the raid in Grantham, Lincolnshire, but claimed he was in the area to enforce a \u0026pound100,000 debt. While in the dock, his work for Liverpool FC hero Gerrard - who last week was named new manager of Rangers - was used as an example of how he collected debts and sorted out problems.  Kinsella claimed he had been contacted by Gerrard\u0027s family after the player was being targeted by George Bromley Jnr, a man nicknamed \u0027The Psycho\u0027 and described as a “violent figure” whose father, another gangland enforcer, had been “executed”. Kinsella claimed he spoke to George Bromley and from then on Bromley left Gerrard alone. The court was later read a letter from Gerrard’s father Paul – obtained after Kinsella went to his home – in which the claims were confirmed.  Mr Gerrard said that, for two years, Bromley attempted to extort money from his son – and threatened to “maim” him – until Kinsella stepped in. Paul Gerrard, whose letter was confirmed as genuine by police, said he and his son had “total respect” for Kinsella. Kinsella, a judo and jujitsu expert, had already served a nine-year prison term when he was contacted by the Gerrards.  He received the sentence at Liverpool Crown Court in October 1991 for attempted robbery and carrying a firearm with intent to commit an offence. Kinsella is believed to have been walking his dog with a friend or family member when he was targeted in a chilling attack at 7am on Saturday. His associate was not injured. A gunman, thought to have been wearing a hi-vis jacket, is believed to have shot Kinsella in a section of woodland popular with dog walkers at around 7am.  The assassin then fled the scene on a mountain bike. Kinsella was pronounced dead and Merseyside Police launched an investigation into the attack that led to a section of an M62 slip road being blocked off. Enquiries are ongoing to identify the gunman, who is described as male, around six foot and of a slim build. A Merseyside police spokeswoman said: “He was wearing dark clothing and a hi-vis jacket and riding a mountain bike. “If you saw someone matching this description around the time or area of the incident, please get in touch.

Imogen Fare, six, and her sister Annabelle, two, both suffer from the life-limiting genetic condition. The brave pair have to take a cocktail of 35 tablets a day to control the symptoms of cystic fibrosis (CF), which particularly causes mucus to build up in the lungs. But a new drug, Orkambi, has been developed in America which can slow the decline in lung function for sufferers of CF.  Imogen and Annabelle have asked the Prime Minister to change NHS rules so they can receive Orkambi on the NHS “Dear Mrs May, I have C.F. so does my little sister Annabelle. the letter said. We would really like Orkambi to keep us well and help us live a long and happy life.”  The heartbreaking message, first reported by the Daily Post , ends with: “We both like swimming and playing outside. Love from Imogen Fare, aged 6, and Annabelle, aged 2.”  The average age at death for half of all CF patients in the UK was estimated to be 37.4 years in 2008, but babies born today can expect to live longer because treatment is improving.  Imogen’s mum Alison, 36, said the family are trying to get as many children with CF as possible to write to Mrs May before the letters are hand-delivered to 10 Downing Street on May 16. She said: “Orkambi is a pioneering drug from America but it’s not currently provided by the NHS except in rare cases on compassionate grounds. “The reason we are keen to Orkambi to be widely available can slow decline in lung function - the main cause of death among people with cystic fibrosis by as much as 42%, which is life-changing.” She believes the drug is not distributed more widely because of the cost. It costs the NHS \u0026pound104,000 to treat a patient for a year.  “My girls have to each take 35 tablets a day, Annabelle takes it in liquid form,” said Alison, who is a bakery supervisor in the north Wales town of Conwy and is married to Dave. “They also to have physiotherapy everyday and Dave or I have to clap their chest several times a day to loosen mucus in their lungs and help them drain. “It’s really tough. Just the other day Imogen said to me that she wished she could chose only one tablet to take everyday rather than having to take so many, it hurts when she says things like that.” "},{"url":null,"title":"karen matthews smitten sugar daddy","story":"NewsKaren Matthews and the smitten sugar daddy, 72, who funds evil mum\u0027s lavish lifestyleIt is claimed that pensioner Eric Anderson has been showering the 43-year-old ex-convict with gifts and helped kit out her flat with top-of-the-range appliances\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAntonia Paget22:22, 5 MAY 2018Updated08:17, 6 MAY 2018NewsSources close to Matthews claim she has targeted older men since leaving prison in 2012 (Image: Flynet)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEvil mum Karen Matthews has found a 72-year old sugar \u0026shydaddy to fund a lavish lifestyle. Pensioner Eric Anderson has been showering the 43-year-old ex-convict – dubbed Britain’s Worst Mother – with money and gifts, it is claimed. Eric, a self-proclaimed devout Christian is said to have helped kit out her state-funded flat with top-of-the-range appliances and super-fast internet. The smitten pensioner has also \u0026shyallegedly given Matthews cash since she was released from prison after serving four years for arranging the kidnap of her nine-year-old daughter Shannon.  Sources close to Matthews – who has dramatically changed her appearance as our exclusive picture shows – claim she has targeted older males since \u0026shyleaving prison in 2012. She is said to have posted profiles on websites for women seeking financial arrangements with men. One source said: “She has an \u0026shyimpressive lifestyle for someone who has been in prison for arranging the kidnap of her own child. “She puts on a good show about having changed but the truth is different. You would think she would be destitute given her past but she has somehow found a way to live a very nice life. “She had friends over for a party and there was apparently champagne and canapes – it certainly wasn’t on a budget. “She has a huge flat screen TV and a Samsung Galaxy 8 smartphone that she flashes about.”  Matthews, who claims to have found God while in prison, now works in a charity shop alongside generous \u0026shypensioner Eric. Our source added: “She’s not getting that money from volunteering. “She makes no secret of the fact that she has older benefactors who keep her in the lifestyle she wants. “She knows how to manipulate \u0026shypeople to get what she wants.” Eric last night declined to comment on whether the relationship is sexual or if born-again Christian Matthews is paid for companionship. But he admitted giving her “care and support” and teaching her about “love.” He said: “It’s my Christian duty to explain what love is about. “She has concerns, she is a \u0026shyperson of need, and whatever that need is, if \u0026shypeople cross my path I will care and support.” When pressed on the nature of the support he is giving to the mum of seven, Eric said: “I am not prepared to tell you.” His response when asked if he has a physical relationship with her was the same. But he added: “People have done their time.  “The more I say the more it will have repercussions for myself and other people.” He then tried to give our reporter a copy of The Bible. So-called sugar daddy dating \u0026shywebsites have boomed in the UK in the past decade. There are more than double the \u0026shyusers than two years ago and they are popular with young students struggling to pay their fees. Matthews is said to have cashed in on the craze, although there is no suggestion she is registered with a specific sugar daddy website or has sought money in return for sexual favours. Matthews, who was relocated away from her home in Dewsbury, West Yorks, is fond of dubious money-making schemes. Her sick plot to \u0026shykidnap Shannon was aimed at collecting \u0026shyreward money when the girl was found. Last week Matthews, who has a new identity, was accused of running a cash-making scam selling sandwiches destined for soup kitchens. The callous criminal – who was jailed 10 years ago after a 24-day manhunt for Shannon – was also previously exposed for a get-rich-quick scheme writing sexually-explicit letters to male admirers from prison.  Matthews never appears to have shown any remorse for Shannon’s kidnap. But pals say she is still very much besotted with her children and her life before prison. One friend said: “She has pictures of her family all over her flat and she has home-made collages of her life before in a shrine. “There are pictures from the family album which she has stuck together with old birthday cards and wrapping paper and written messages on in felt tip pen. “She still maintains that she loves her family.” Matthews caused outrage when it emerged she kept a Best Mum ornament on her bedside table. She told pal it was bought for her by an official \u0026shyassigned to help her rehabilitation. The search for Shannon in early 2008 was a huge police operation. She was found sedated at the home of Michael Donovan, 39, uncle of Matthews’ boyfriend Craig Meehan.

The heatwave is no fun for anyone, but there are a few things you can do to at least cool down your home. There\u0027s nothing worse than trying to nod off in your room, or trying to relax, while feeling like you\u0027re in the seventh circle of hell. Being in the midst of a heatwave is not as fun as it first sounds, especially without air con, but there are some things you can do to cool down your home and finally get some shut eye. Before we get to how to use a freezer to your advantage (not sticking your head in it) and getting as low as you can (no this isn\u0027t limbo), we have to acknowledge the quickest way is to get air con. Of course, the bad thing about getting air con is the cost - upfront and then running it - so here are a few quick tips and tricks to drop your home\u0027s temperature without spending too much.  Keep away from the satin and silk and opt for the cooler linen and cotton sheets. Light-coloured bed linen made of light fabrics (take Egyptian cotton for example) are breathable so better to sleep in. The Egyptians had it right, in fact, they even had their own method for keeping cool. Known as The Egyptian Method (original, we know) they\u0027d dampen a towel or sheet in cool water and use it as a blanket. It may be a good idea to lay the damp sheet on top of a towel first, no one likes a wet bed. 2. Freezer tricks Speaking of sheets, you can stick them in the freezer for a few minutes before you\u0027re about to go to sleep. No, we haven\u0027t lost our minds, just make sure you put them in something like a plastic bag before you pop them in. You don\u0027t want your sheets smelling of pizza and ice cream. The trick won\u0027t last all night but it will give you a breather so you can get to sleep. 3. Don\u0027t cook a roast  ...or any hot meal. Summer is never the time to be whipping up a casserole or hot meal. Put the slow cooker away, step away from the stove and have a salad. 4. Use that hot water bottle Buy yourself a hot water bottle. While we\u0027re used to filling them with hot water in the winter to keep toasty, in the summer sticking it in the freezer instead creates a lovely ice pack. 5. Turn your fan around Fans are great in the mild heat, but when it\u0027s cranked up they just blow hot air around so it\u0027s all about strategic placement. If you point them outside, slightly towards the windows, they push out the hot air. If you have a ceiling fan set them counter-clockwise to pull the hot air away. 6. Ice fan  We\u0027ve already mentioned fans, but there\u0027s so much more to be said. At school we used to use those little iceboxes to keep our food cool, so this idea comes from that. It\u0027s sort of a DIY aircon system. Use a roasting pan, or box and fill it with ice and put it in front of a fan. When the ice melts the breeze from the fan picks up the cool air coming from the ice\u0027s surface, creating a nice cool mist. 7. Cross breeze More of the fan tricks. Strategically place numerous fans around a room. Put a fan by the window, and then another further inside the room so they both push the cooler air around the room. 8. How low can you go Hot air rises so sleeping in a room on the ground floor means you\u0027ll feel cooler. If you\u0027re in a one-storey flat you can move your sheet to the ground to make life easier. 9. Don\u0027t get steamy  We imagine you\u0027re continually hopping in the shower to cool down, just make sure the water is tepid rather than warm/hot. Steam hangs about and makes a room that much hotter. 10. No lights This should make sense. Light bulbs - even if they\u0027re environmentally friendly - give off heat, so switch them off. The sun shines for longer now anyway so keeping the lights off not only saves on your energy bill, but cuts down on the extra heat. 11. Hang a wet sheet Yes, you read that right. Hanging a wet sheet in front of an open window will help bring down the room\u0027s temperature. 12. No electronic devices  The same applies here as the lights. Unplug your phone and devices, do not charge them when you are asleep. Everything radiates heat and you don\u0027t need that when you\u0027re trying to catch some zzzs. 13. Use grains Buckwheat pillows don\u0027t absorb heat like cotton does so getting one is a good investment for summer. 14. Closing curtains  In the daytime. If you think about when the sun is at its hottest those rays are coming through the window hotting everything up. Close the curtains and your room is instantly cooler.  15. Use your garden  If you plant the right trees and shrubs around the house they will provide you with much needed shade. Vines work well too. Of course that won\u0027t work for this summer, but next year you\u0027ll be thanking us. 16. Paint it white  Again, maybe one for next year, but painting your house white helps. The white colour reflects the light, cooling the house down. 17. Insulate  Long-term thinking again. When you think of insulation you probably think of keeping warm, but it can work the other way too. Good insulation keeps the heat out as well once the room is cooled down.

Tragic Amelia Wood was hit by a wheel that flew off a Land Rover Discovery as she walked to school. Her heartbroken mum Hayley Hodson says the family was inspired to donate her organs by brave Amelia’s three-year early childhood battle with cancer. And the decision has saved the lives of three young boys and a woman in her 20s. Today – as we highlight other heartwarming selfless acts by ordinary people – grieving Hayley, 38, reveals: “Amelia died the day after the accident. A doctor very tactfully asked if we would donate and I immediately said yes.  “Amelia had leukaemia and we lived and breathed that for so long. The question of organ donation was never a question for me. We spent years around children who needed bone marrow transplants while Amelia only had chemotherapy.” The youngster, of Grimoldby, Lincs, had been walking to a bus stop to go to Louth Academy in March when the front wheel of the 4x4 broke off and struck her. The driver was said to be ‘devastated’ and had bought the Discovery a month earlier. Amelia was airlifted to hospital earlier this year but could not be saved. Now the family is mourning the loss of their “happy, funny, lively, beautiful” girl.  Hayley – who has sons Oscar, eight, and Dexter, three – said: “About two weeks ago we received a letter saying Amelia’s organs had saved the lives of three young boys and woman in her 20s. “It’s an amazing feeling but we are still getting our heads around the fact that Amelia is not here. “We still see the bus go past that she would have got off and expect her to come through the door. “She was very generous. If she had \u0026pound2 in her pocket she would spend it on sweets for her little brothers and her. It’s fantastic she has given other people the opportunity of survival. But it’s very difficult to let go.” How acts of kindness triumph against odds Calm Jen defied concert bomber A brave Ariana Grande fan came to the rescue of a wounded teenager in the midst of the Manchester Arena horror last year. Ella McGovern, 14, suffered leg injuries and perforated eardrums through Salman Abedi’s suicide bomb that killed 22 people.  She couldn’t hear her mum Louise as she called home for help – but Jennifer Lee, 24, of Ramsbottom, Lancs, calmed them both down and helped arrange a place for them to meet after putting in an emergency call. “To hear Jenny’s voice saying, ‘I’m with your daughter, she’s OK. I’ve called an ambulance’ was amazing for me,” said Louise. “It was instant relief. Jenny genuinely is a hero.” Trishaw rides give over-85s a boost Big-hearted Fraser Johnston, 20, bagged a Mirror Pride of Britain Award for his pioneering cycling scheme to get old people out and about. The graduate takes care home residents on rural rides on his trishaw, which carries two passengers. Since setting up Cycling Without Age in Falkirk in 2016, Fraser and 30 volunteers have given rides to more than 150 residents over 85.  “It started when I took a couple of women to see the Kelpies scuptures,” he says. “They loved it. The residents see things outside that jog memories. The rides help stimulate the minds of those with dementia. It improves their overall quality of life.” Climber saves lost dogs on mountain A hero climber scaled one of England’s highest peaks to save a stranger’s pets. Scott Pilling, 37, spotted a Facebook appeal about two dogs missing on 3,100ft Helvellyn, in the Lake District, for two days.  The determined mountaineer searched through wintry weather for terrier Cash and German Shepherd Lilah before finding them trapped beneath overhanging snow. With the help of four walkers, including three off-duty fireman, Scott rescued the freezing pets, who had been separated from owner Colette Kilroy on a walk. Colette, 27, told him: “You are a hero in my eyes, and my dogs’  Angel. I will never be able to thank you enough for helping my babies.” Hero of the great blizzard bakeaway Greggs delivery driver Jon Gowing trekked through a blizzard to dish out cakes and pasties to stranded drivers when his lorry got stuck in a jam. They were all trapped on the A1 near Lindisfarne, Northumberland, as temperatures plummeted.  Rather than sheltering in his warm lorry, Jon dished out goodies up and down the two-mile queue with the help of engineer Les Goff. “He was a top guy,” said Les. “He said they would go to waste.” Jon’s employers said: “We are so proud of Jon and his act of kindness in what must have been a very tough situation for everyone stuck on the A1.” Strangers help pay poor family\u0027s debt Fans of Channel 5’s Rich House Poor House were in tears as a family broke the rules – and helped the other pay off debts.  Hard-up Sarah and Ross Timmins – struggling with two kids and \u0026pound11,500 credit card debt – swapped homes with wealthy vets Colin and Lizzy Whiting, of Newquay, Cornwall, who were moved by their plight. So, at the end of the switch, they offered to wipe \u0026pound8,000 off their debt.  “For a family who had never met us to have stepped in our shoes and made such a gesture, I didn’t think it existed,” said Ross, 28, of Redruth, who was working a 90-hour week. Lizzy said: “Their debt felt insurmountable. It didn’t feel right to leave them like that.” Homeless man\u0027s shop door saviour Good Samaritan Shane Sharkey and his kind-hearted community transformed the life of a homeless man in a shop doorway.

The tender moment was snapped by their proud mum Kate on Charlotte’s third birthday on Wednesday – and released by they royals last night. The duchess, a keen amateur photographer, also shared a photo she took at their Kensington Palace home of Prince Louis when he was three days old. The youngest member of the Royal family is wide-eyed in a white outfit, propped up on top of a white frilly cushion.  Four-year-old Prince George is mysteriously absent from both photos. But the picture of Charlotte is similar to one Kate took of George puckering up to his little sister a few weeks after her birth. This is not the first time Kate, 36, – one of the world’s most photographed women – has gone the other side of the lens. In 2015 she took the first official photographs of Charlotte. Kate has also released pictures to mark other milestones in her children’s lives, including George and Charlotte’s first days at nursery school.  Last year she accepted a lifetime honorary membership of the Royal Photographic Society in recognition of her talent and enthusiasm. Kate’s work also gets the thumbs-up from Mirror photographer Ian Vogler. He said: “It’s always hard to get a nice picture of very young children. I know from my own experiences. But the Duchess of Cambridge has done a really good job with the picture of Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. “It’s a really charming image of a big sister proud of her new sibling. “Both pictures are nicely lit with natural daylight the best way to photograph children. The picture of Prince Louis on his own is more formal looking but at the same time it’s very good. “Just getting such a young baby to keep his eyes open is an achievement.” "},{"url":null,"title":"supermarket shoppers urged check cupboards","story":"NewsSupermarket shoppers urged to check cupboards after Lidl, Tesco and Sainsbury\u0027s urgently recall these productsA number of leading stores have issued urgent recalls for tarnished products due to fears over allergies, choking hazards and possibly dangerous pet food\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJamie Bullen23:42, 5 MAY 2018Updated08:42, 6 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThree leading British supermarkets have urged shoppers to check their cupboards for tarnished products after recalling some of their products.

Kate Middleton and Prince William have gone the traditional route with George, Charlotte and more recently, Louis. But other families are prepared to try something a bit different.  The Daily Record has reported on three Scottish families who found inspiration in some rather unusual places.   Ransom Morrow   The parents of Ransom Morrow hope his life won’t be as wild as the cowboy he’s named after. Lydia, 22, and illustrator Dave, 31, called their six-month-old son after Jimmy Stewart’s character in the Western The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. The couple, who live in Glasgow, say their little boy has been holding their hearts to ransom since he arrived on October 4 last year.  Lydia, who was born in Indiana, US, said: “A couple of years ago, we were talking about baby names while watching a Western. Jimmy Stewart’s character was called Ransom and we both agreed it was a great name. “When we found out I was pregnant, we started discussing names but couldn’t agree on a single one. The only one we both liked was Ransom so it stuck. “People think it’s unusual but he suits it and we can’t imagine him being called anything else.” Lydia, who has just graduated from Glasgow School of Art, added: “We are quite a creative family. Dave is an animator and illustrator and I’m hoping to do something in textile design so it makes sense that we were creative when it came to naming our baby.”  Amazon   When parents Anneliese Pirt and Andy Harris were searching for a name for their little boy, they wanted something unique. So they turned to their family tree for inspiration and called their son after the world’s most famous rainforest – and not, as some have suggested, the online retailer. And at just six months old, Amazon Atlas Spruce Harris is already living up to his globe-trotting name. The Edinburgh-born tot has visited Denmark, Switzerland, Australia and Fiji.  Primary school teacher Anneliese, 36, said: “We get a lot of people asking us if he is named after Amazon – but we just politely smile and say no.  “We wanted him to have a name that was unusual and special to us. Amazon really suits him and he already has the personality to match.” Anneliese says she and husband Andy, 41, a safety expert, chose the name Amazon to honour her relative Richard Spruce, a 19th-century botanist who spent 15 years exploring the river. She said: “Richard is famous in the world of botany. He was a great Victorian explorer and travelled down the Amazon.  “I’ve done research into him and discovered there is even a statue in his honour in Banos, Ecuador, which I have visited. “My grandad researched our family tree to find out my exact connection to Richard and he was probably my great-great uncle. Spruce is my mum’s maiden name. Andy and I had a great trip to South America, going down the Amazon following in my ancestor’s footsteps from Peru through Colombia to Brazil.  “We both fell in love with the idea of calling our baby Amazon and decided it was a good unisex name that would work whether we had a boy or a girl.”   The couple also set their hearts on the name Atlas as a middle name for their son, who was born at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh last October. Anneliese, who was born in Edinburgh, added: “Andy and I both have a love of travelling. “We actually met abroad. So Atlas reflects our love of travel, our hopes Amazon will enjoy travelling too and that he will know his way in life.  “We are now living in Fiji. Travelling is in Amazon’s genes – it’s the perfect name .”   Ultra-Violet  "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather hottest summer five","story":"NewsUK weather: Hottest summer for five years predicted as Brits roast in BBQ Bank Holiday heatwaveBeaches and parks have been packed with sun worshippers and it could become a regular scene in the coming months\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAlistair Grant14:40, 6 MAY 2018Updated14:45, 6 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Parts of the UK are set for the hottest summer for five years as Brits bask in a BBQ Bank Holiday heatwave with temperatures set to soar on Monday.  Beaches and parks have been packed with sun worshippers and it could become a regular scene with the next three months due to be warmer than usual. Temperatures rose to about 25C on Sunday and Monday is due to be even hotter with the mercury rising to around 28C in some places. It is expected to be the hottest Bank Holiday Monday since record-keeping began 40 years ago, and it could be the hottest Bank Holiday ever.  Brits flocked to the coast to cool off and enjoy the dry and sunny weather - with thousands cramming beaches in beauty spots including Brighton and Bournemouth. London\u0027s parks - including King George Park in Wandsworth - were filled with sunbathers as people made the most of the sunshine while it lasts. It was perfect weather for anyone taking part in outdoor events - such as the Tour de Yorkshire or the Canalway Cavalcade narrowboat festival in Little Venice in London - or just wanting to relax.  The temperature soared after a chilly start to the day. In Santon Downham, Suffolk, for example, the mercury jumped more than 17 degrees in just four hours - from 2C at 6am to 19.6C at 10am, the Met Office said. Sunday also got off to a cold start at Fistral beach in Newquay, Cornwall, where surfers and people out for a morning walk had to contend with sea fog. Temperatures will remain in the mid to high 20s in the warmest regions through Tuesday before they dip back into the mid to high teens with the return of rain by next weekend.  Scotland, meanwhile, is set for its hottest summer since 2013 with forecasters predicting spells of 27C heat in the months ahead. But there will be times when the sunshine is broken by cooler and wetter spells. The Met Office\u0027s three-month forecast said: For May-July, above-average temperatures are more probable than below-average temperatures.  The probability the UK average temperature for May-July will fall into the warmest of our five categories is 30 per cent. The probability of the coldest of our five categories is between five and 10 per cent. Brian Gaze, a forecaster with The Weather Outlook, said: This summer could be the warmest for five years - 27C could be seen in Scotland from June onwards.

John Kinsella, 53, was gunned down by a bike-riding assassin while he was out walking his dog with another person.  He became known nationally when it emerged in court in 2008 that he had once stopped a thug nicknamed \u0027The Psycho\u0027 from terrorising Liverpool footballer Steven Gerrard.   The martial arts expert from Everton once had the audacity to appeal a jail sentence while he was on the run - and won a reduced sentence, the Liverpool Echo reports.    BREAKING Gangland enforcer who saved footballer Steven Gerrard from thug executed by gunman on bike while walking dog  Gerrard’s name was introduced to jurors hearing robbery allegations against Kinsella at a Lincoln Crown Court trial in 2008. Then 43, Kinsella was one of four men accused of taking part in a robbery at a haulage depot in Grantham in which more than \u0026pound41,000 of detergent, Easter eggs and Pringles were stolen. During the March 2006 robbery, a night watchman was tied up by a gang of up to nine men wearing balaclavas and camouflage clothing. No weapons were carried, but the victim was hit with his own stick after it fell out of his pocket.  Kinsella was captured on the outskirts of Greater Manchester after a high-speed chase with police on the A1 and M62. He always denied the allegations, using his trial to claim he was in the area to collect a \u0026pound100,000 debt. That he had such a role was a key part of his defence, an argument bolstered by him being able to turn to the Gerrard family for their support in the case. Jurors in the robbery trial were told he was contacted by the star’s family after the former Reds captain was “terrorised” by a mobster known as \u0027The Psycho\u0027.  Kinsella said the man responsible, George Bromley Jnr, was a “violent figure” whose father, another gangland enforcer, had been “executed”. He claimed he spoke to George Bromley and from then on Bromley left Gerrard alone. The court was later read a letter from Gerrard’s father Paul – obtained after Kinsella went to his home – in which the claims were confirmed. Mr Gerrard said that, for two years, \u0027The Psycho\u0027 attempted to extort money from his son – and threatened to “maim” him – until Kinsella stepped in.  Mr Gerrard, whose letter was confirmed as genuine by police, said he and his son had “total respect” for Kinsella. Despite that evidence Kinsella was convicted - though he was no longer under the gaze of the authorities when the verdicts were delivered after absconding just as his trial was coming to an end. While on the run he had the audacity to challenge the 14 year, three month sentence given in his absence. Appeal judges agreed his jail term was “manifestly excessive” and reduced it by three years, with Lord Justice Moses saying he found it a “curious business” that a man on the run from the law was appealing a sentence when he was not even in custody.  After 11 months on the run he was hauled back to the UK after being arrested at gunpoint by armed police in Amsterdam. Kinsella, a judo and jujitsu expert, had already served a nine-year prison term when he was contacted by the Gerrards. He received the sentence at Liverpool Crown Court in October 1991 for attempted robbery and carrying a firearm with intent to commit an offence. Kinsella is thought to have been walking his dog with a friend or family member when he was shot dead in a stretch of woodland near the M62 on Saturday morning.

However locals have slammed 38-year-old Graeme Stokes for not reporting the amusing incident to police - after he filmed the bird aggressively pecking at a new black Lexus in Brighton. The father of two attempted to scare the bird off - however the stubborn seagull stood its ground. Hilarious footage shows the seagull repeatedly pecking the vehicle\u0027s passenger door and loudly squawking in frustration as it attempted to attack what it believed to be another seagull. Sharing the video on social media, the nurse was stunned to be sent messages by angry locals saying he should have called the police to report the bird\u0027s antics.  Graeme, from Brighton, said: It was making a bit of a racket as I was walking up the street so I looked over as it was screeching as they often do. It was pecking at the car and going mad at it, it was really quite aggressive. So I quickly got my phone out and filmed it. Then I went over to try to shoo it away as I was worried about it damaging the car, it was going at it that bad. But as I walked over it began to scream at me and I thought \u0027sod that, I\u0027m not going near it\u0027.  Graeme continued: They are like vultures round here. I have heard stories of them causing serious injuries to people so as it turned on me and shouted I thought I\u0027d better stay clear. I thought the car would stand up better to the pecking than I would. I could still hear it pecking at the car as I walked away. It could have carried on all day for all I know. I could see that its beak was chipping the paint. It was getting spooked by its own reflection in the car as it was quite a shiny car so you could see the reflection clearly. It kept bobbing its head from left to right in anger, staring at itself. You would have thought it had encountered its reflection before. But it was Sunday morning in Brighton after all - perhaps it had had a few beers the night before.

Baggy flares, massive statement belts, stripy highlights, those skirt-trouser things, inflatable everything, bubble writing - there was a lot going on.  Happily, apart from the odd rogue trend which has since resurfaced, many of these have stayed in the noughties and quietly died the death they so richly deserve.  But one fashion statement is set to make a comeback and, call us nostalgic, we\u0027re actually really excited. Remember Groovy Chick? If you\u0027re of a certain age, then you definitely will.  Groovy Chick didn\u0027t really do anything other than adorn Bang On The Door merchandise - of which there was a lot (stationary, bedding, clothing, you name it) but that wasn\u0027t the point, Because in doing so, she became a sort of fashion phenonmenon. There were other Bang on the Door characters too Fairy Girl, Beach Babe - but Groovy Chick was the Big Dog. Now, thanks to Primark, she is set to rule again - 30 years after she was initially designed by Karen Duncan and Samantha Stringle.

Kim Jong-un promised to denuclearise the Korean peninsula last month during a landmark summit with South Korea\u0027s President Moon Jae-in. It\u0027s the first time a North Korean leader has stepped foot in the south since the end of the Korean War in 1953. The pledge boosted hopes of peace amid fears over North Korea\u0027s nuclear missile programme and even prompted Republicans to suggest Donald Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his role, despite months of online threats. But North Korea has now accused the US of misleading public opinion over the diplomatic breakthrough, which it was claimed was aided by a series of UN and US sanctions designed to halt the development of nuclear weapons.  The state\u0027s official news agency KCNA reported that North Korea also warned the US not to deliberately provoke Kim Jong-un by moving to deploy strategic assets in South Korea and raising human rights issues. This act cannot be construed otherwise than a dangerous attempt to ruin the hardly-won atmosphere of dialogue and bring the situation back to square one, the a foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying. It would not be conducive to resolving the issue of denuclearisation if Washington miscalculated North Korea\u0027s peace-loving intention as a sign of weakness and continued to pursue its pressure and military threats, KCNA said. Trump, who plans to meet Kim over the next few weeks, has said he will maintain sanctions and pressure on the North and not repeat the mistakes of past administrations.  He claimed his tough stance had helped create the breakthrough. Trump told the National Rifle Association\u0027s annual convention in Dallas on Friday that he had toned down his rhetoric in anticipation of the talks after labelling Kim Little Rocket Man last year and threatening him with fire and fury.  Moon said Trump deserved a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end the standoff with the North, while 18 House Republicans also backed him to be awarded the honour.

Some demonstrators were topless while others wore bras or bikini tops as they raised awareness about women\u0027s rights, inequality and crimes against women. This year\u0027s march also called for an end to victim blaming or shaming in cases of sexual violence, including rape. Slut Walks have been held in cities around the world since they began in Toronto, Canada, after a police officer suggested to university students that women could avoid being sexually assaulted by not dressing like sluts.   During Friday\u0027s march in Tel Aviv, women carried signs with slogans including Not guilty, Make love, not rape and A thong is not an invitation to rape, the Times of Israel reported.  Other posters featured images of high-profile men who have been convicted of sexual abuse. Women wrote the Hebrew word for slut or phrases such as No means no on their bodies.   Event organiser Bracha Barad told the Jerusalem Post: The word \u0027slut\u0027 is not just a word intended to humiliate women, it serves society and the system as a justification for rape.  She added: There is no connection between the victim\u0027s clothing or her sexual past and the attack she has endured. The law and enforcement authorities are quick to grant exemptions to rapists. An organiser wrote on an event listing for the Slut Walk: This year, again, many women joined the endless list of victims who were blamed.  This year, again, we could not walk the streets in peace, even though the streets are ours as much as they are theirs. This year, again, thy wisteled [sic] at us, honked at us, yelled at us \u0027you’re so fine\u0027, \u0027man what I’d do to you\u0027, \u0027those tits!\u0027, \u0027that ass!\u0027. This year, again, our body was considered public property. "}]
