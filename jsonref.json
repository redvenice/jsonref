His paintings often turn up online under headlines such as This Art Is Cool: Imagining a Dystopian Sweden Full of Robots and Dinosaurs, where people marvel at his beautiful and haunting melding of sci-fi and suburbia: rural towns where children spend listless afternoons exploring rusting robot skeletons, and giant cooling towers haunt the horizon. On his Instagram account, where a painting of a petrol station at dusk can get thousands of likes, fans from all over the world write to tell him that his landscapes look just like their back yards, from Minnesota to Norway – just with a few more flying cars than they remember.But if you think Stålenhag’s art is his prediction for humanity, you’d be wrong, too. None of his art is in future but the past specifically his 80s childhood on Färingsö, a large island located in Sweden’s Lake Mälaren. Now 36, he lives just two kilometres from the house where he grew up. When we speak, he shows me the view and it’s grey, grey, grey: colossal skies, austere plains of murky grass. It’s desolate and beautiful, just like his art.“Sweden is flat and kind of boring,” he says, gazing out of the window. “But I think the boring parts are exciting. I’ve always disliked overly dramatic aesthetics. When I went to the US for the first time, my eyes couldn’t even process the Disneyesque landscapes.” Robots and dinosaurs make people see past the boring flatness and find something beautiful, he says: “If I just painted a field in April, no one would look.”Tales from the Loop is set in an alternative history, one where the second world war encouraged more research into nuclear technology which then birthed new branches of experimental physics which in turn lead to the construction a giant particle accelerator in rural Sweden that is dubbed “Slingan” by the locals, or “The Loop”. By the time it is shut down in 1994, it has shaped a generation of children, to whom robots, particle guns and airships are as quotidian as homework and teatime. There’s little plot in the often very short stories, which are as fleeting as a half-recalled memory: two twins accidentally swap bodies (their parents never notice), a break in space and time sees trilobites take over the school gym, a standoff between police and a bolshie child wielding a robotic glove. When a $10,000 crowdfunding campaign was set up in 2015 to publish the book, it raised $320,000 (£255,000). It has since spawned a sequel, board games and now an Amazon Prime show starring Jonathan Pryce and Rebecca Hall.It was similarly instinctual, he says, to return to his childhood, and he’s never left it since, painting and repainting his backyard like Monet and his water lilies. “I knew I wanted to write Tales from the Loop before I even wrote a word. I just got better at painting. My artistic ideas are exactly the same as they were in my teens. I’ve always wanted to be here. I work better in remote places – self-isolating is nothing to me.”When we speak, he hasn’t visited Stockholm for weeks. He worries that people in his area, where the greatest vector for disease is the local convenience store, aren’t taking the coronavirus outbreak seriously. “It’s scary. There is no nation on earth that has the capacity to deal with that kind of overload. The worst thing is, if we manage to flatten the curve, people will say we overreacted. If we don’t, then we didn’t do enough. I feel like I’m watching a hockey game, where you’re nervous about every little thing that happens. What a weird time to be alive.”In both the book and the show, a thin membrane separates the world of children and that of adults, who have a better notion of what might be going on inside the depths of the Loop. In one story, Stålenhag’s alter-ego narrator tells us: “Rumour had it that they were trying to create machines that could feel and reason. Apparently they made progress they were unable to stop prototypes escaping on several occasions.” In the next story, “an oily, sad little tin-can thing” is found nervously lurking by child-Stålenhag in the back yard when his father comes out, “it is gone in three bounds”.There is something childlike about Stålenhag, who bounds around the house showing me paintings. “I don’t feel like an adult,” he says later. “I like kids because I don’t think they know secrets. They’re just oblivious enough. It is important that adults exist, so kids can stay oblivious, but I’ve always felt more sympathetic to young people because they have fresh eyes. Teenagers have good bullshit detectors. To be progressive and liberal is to be ready for the next generation to call you out on your bullshit. It is really important to listen to young people. There is nothing I hate more than adults whose only argument is, ‘Respect your elders!’. No, please don’t!”He admires his fellow Swede Greta Thunberg, and is baffled by her detractors. “She doesn’t say anything controversial at all and gets called brainwashed. You’d have to be crazy to think that.”Speaking to Stalenhåg, you sense there is a political firebrand waiting to burst out. He flits from morals to pornography, advertising to the decline of democracy, and the conservatism he sees in his country. “Sweden is super-racist, because it is so white. We’ve never had to coexist with anyone different to us, so racism is bubbling up everywhere. The politicians say, ‘Don’t bring in the refugees, help them at the border’. They’re trying to morally justify how they think, but that is not how human suffering works. If you think ‘We, in this nation, have no obligation to those in that nation’, you subscribe to a simplistic idea of humanity. But this is the world we live in.”However, he looks alarmed at the suggestion that this political awareness is the reason people see predictions of our future decline in his paintings. “It can ruin the art to be too unambiguous,” he says.But people loved your painting of an army of colossal robo-Trumps, I say.“No, no! I wouldn’t do that kind of art seriously,” he protests. “It’s not interesting. Painting is not intellectual for me, it is emotional. I have no training in art, I have experience. When I paint, I don’t analyse it.”Even with the show now out in the world, he still seems surprised that his childhood memories became a TV project. He likes the show for the reason many will – it is strange, quiet and slow, noticeably so for one made by a big-budget US producer. “I would have really hated to see an artificial plot put in the world but there was no studio pressure to put in a bad guy. I am very happy with it,” he says.Stålenhag wasn’t involved in the production of the series, but he spent five days on the set in Canada. “I went from here,” he says, gesturing at the flat Swedish landscape, “flew 20 hours and ended up somewhere that looks exactly the same. Not much bang for your buck.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae8fab2db91130d6e6f89366acf534b9cdf07119/0_428_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fc7d54f8018f75998a537e3356b8fbb","title":"imf has no experience of recession arriving with such ferocity","story":"Recovery will take some time as countries will exit Covid-19 lockdown only graduallyIn 1941, Britain considered its colony of Singapore to be pretty much impregnable. But while the naval base was bristling with big guns, its defences were geared towards preventing a sea-based invasion and when the attack came it was on land, down the Malay peninsula. Britain was expecting trouble, just not from that direction.The same fate has befallen the International Monetary Fund and the Office for Budget Responsibility, both of which have been forced to rip up their forecasts as a result of Covid-19. Both organisations knew there was potential for things to go wrong: they simply did not spot the likely cause.The fact that the Covid-19 pandemic spread so quickly meant countries had virtually no time to prepare. Nor had they any experience of a recession arriving with such sudden ferocity. A look back at past slumps shows that it normally takes 18 months to two years for output to fall from peak to trough. This time, both the International Monetary Find (IMF) and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) think the UK is already experiencing the worst of the slump and that, following a swift collapse, recovery will begin in the second half of 2020.The IMF is more cautious, and is pencilling in a more gradual recovery not just for the UK but for the global economy as a whole. It remains to be seen how gradual the process proves to be, and whether it is interrupted by a recurrence of the Covid-19 virus. The IMF is encouraged by the evidence that the lockdowns are helping contain the virus and thinks the extraordinary policy response from central banks will help limit the number of firms going bust and job losses.But it has sketched alternatives to its baseline forecast, which take into account extended lockdowns and a second outbreak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c28ba73120163e141215090e28423d597a6bfae6/0_48_3100_1860/master/3100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dc3809af5dafd47c995458484ef73e0","title":"jp morgan sets aside 83bn to cover covid 19 losses","story":"Wall Street bank earmarks sum to cover credit cards and oil and gas sector lossesJP Morgan, Wall Street’s biggest bank, has put aside $8.3bn (£6.6bn) to cover potential loan losses as it braces itself for a “fairly severe recession” caused by the Covid-19 outbreak.The chairman and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said the lender had had a strong start to the year but that JP Morgan needed to prepare for the realities of an economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 outbreak as well as the recent plunge in oil prices.Dimon said: “The underlying results of the company were extremely good. However, given the likelihood of a fairly severe recession, it was necessary to build credit reserves of $6.8bn, resulting in total credit costs of $8.3bn for the quarter.”The bulk of the extra provisions – about $4.4bn – are meant to cover consumer loans that might go sour, most of which is expected to come from credit cards.The remaining $2.4bn will help JP Morgan prepare for potential loan losses from business customers, with the largest losses expected from oil and gas companies, as well as real estate and retail.Dimon said the bank was well-capitalised, with around $1tn worth of of liquid assets ready to be deployed to cover losses if necessary.However, analysts believe it is still too soon to predict how severe the economic downturn caused by coronavirus could be.Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst for Markets, said: “The bank is preparing for a severe recession and needs to set aside capital to cover expected losses – the problem is no one has a clue how big these might be. I should stress that even the cleverest banks won’t know just what the damage will be in a situation where the economy is stopped and then restarted.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b9a68cccb4ae76e2e4a8a583f43054712b66fd4/244_303_4092_2457/master/4092.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f63c7d0ed5032d60e7f3a62838720f2","title":"tell us how has coronavirus affected small businesses in the uk","story":"We would like to hear about how the coronavirus outbreak has impacted small and medium enterprisesOnly 4,200 of the small and medium-sized businesses who enquired about the government’s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) have so far been successful.It is estimated 300,000 firms have sought help but out of the tens of thousands who made formal applications, only a fraction have been given the go-ahead.We want to hear from small and medium enterprises in the UK about how they have been affected by the outbreak.Have you applied for a loan from the government scheme and been rejected?

These iding lines extend beyond the cabinet and the governing party, to become a new shorthand in an old culture war. The right wants to get back to business as usual the left wants a lockdown for as long as it takes.That is the wrong way to approach these decisions, which will entail constant and painful trade-offs. Conceptually, we find it easiest to focus on the things we can count. So we talk about stock markets, about businesses going bust and about unemployment as a cost to the exchequer – and the imperative to lift the lockdown thus becomes a purely economic one. And on the other hand, we talk about numbers infected, numbers of ventilators, numbers of dead. Yet behind all these numbers, there are people, whose physical and mental health are symbiotic: people to whose wellbeing the virus is not the only threat.Even while recessions are not historically associated with higher mortality, our recent experience of fiscal contraction and austerity was of huge numbers of excess deaths. There are impacts that aren’t yet visible but which we nevertheless cannot ignore Anne Case, co-author of Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism, pointed out recently that the negative effects of unemployment won’t show up for perhaps five years but have to be part of our consideration, even while this provides no obvious, definitive course of action.Likewise, isolation has its own health impact. People who were already suffering serious mental illness, or were already housebound with disabilities, have seen many of their support networks capsize overnight, which will create its own tragedies. People living in overcrowded conditions, without green space, will have a potentially devastating experience of self-isolation.You can’t even generalise across the category of “childhood” – an affluent kid in year 7 is just having a really long Easter holiday. A kid in year 11, ready for GCSEs, relying on free school meals, is facing something much starker. We were encouraged by Patel at the weekend to think of those living in abusive relationships, and perhaps stick a supportive logo, declaring “you are not alone”, in our windows. Our sympathetic thoughts are insufficient to the point of insult we need to think seriously about the hidden hardship this confinement entails, and it is humane to do so, not the act of some hard-boiled bread-head.None of this is an argument against the lockdown, or even for a shorter period of constraint. It is not at all clear when any of the restrictions could be lifted, or in which order. It is a fruitless discussion to have before we have greater clarity on testing, greater confidence that the antibody tests will work.Rather, it’s a plea for the subtlety and complexity of the question to be reflected in the way it is discussed. If we allow this to calcify into a debate between right and left, the plurality of views collapses into two as we all line up behind our team. Expertise is so often characterised by uncertainty, knowing enough to know that every decision contains pros and cons, consequences both foreseeable and not. Binary debates invite absolute views, and chase away the frustrating complexities of knowledge, in favour of arguments that can obliterate one another. It actually isn’t fair – and I never thought I’d feel so sympathetic to them – on the politicians of any party, to turn decisions so seismic into questions of loyalty to a pre-existing agenda.Meanwhile, there are many questions that plainly are political, which we’re asked by the government not to politicise. The provision of protective equipment to NHS and social care staff is not the unknowable conundrum that the health secretary pretends it is, with his intimations that staff are misusing it, and his airy talk of targets hoped for rather than targets met. There is an obvious duty on the state, if it’s asking people to risk their lives, to protect those people to the very limits of its ability.Likewise, the testing of NHS staff, of care workers, of bus drivers, of prison officers, of the wider population, this is all a matter for public debate. It is legitimate to interrogate policy every step of the way, and reasonable to point out hypocrisy or incompetence. It would be derelict not to scrutinise decisions around sick pay and other entitlements, income protection for those in insecure work. In the grim daily death toll, it is right to ask how the tragedy is being distributed, what can be done to address the disproportionate risk faced by those in low-paid work, why black and minority ethnic people comprise such a high number of the total, how to narrow these health inequalities in real time. A nation may come together in the face of an emergency, but it doesn’t need to switch its brain off.Yet the way forward, murky and obscure, is made no clearer by partisanship. If we build the strategy of the next phase well, it will be short on fireworks. There will be no grandstanding or rabble-rousing it will be hard to tell who’s on which team there will be a large variety of expert voices, making points subtle enough that to hear the differences between them, we’ll have to listen it will be conducted in pastels not neon. The pandemic appears to distill politics down to its barest essentials: do you care about money, or do you care about people? The only problem is, it doesn’t."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca349aa8d4765bc69f2f24ede88f8797e5e603f2/17_0_4729_2840/master/4729.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d82e6e88a803e936e19b8e186331af4","title":"coronavirus uk ireland delay","story":"In March, while the UK delayed, Ireland acted. For many this may prove to have been the difference between life and deathThe choices our governments have made in the last month have profoundly shaped what risks we, as citizens, are exposed to during the course of this pandemic. Those choices have, to a large extent, determined how many of us will die.At the time of writing, 365 people have died in Ireland of Covid-19 and 11,329 have died in the UK. Adjusted for population, there have been 7.4 deaths in Ireland for every 100,000 people. In the UK, there have been 17 deaths per 100,000. In other words, people are dying of coronavirus in the UK at more than twice the rate they are dying in Ireland. Yet, despite Ireland being your closest neighbour, this has barely been mentioned in the British press.In Ireland, we consume a great deal of British media. This means that we’ve been watching, with growing despair and grief, British news reports chronicling a national disaster. But for weeks now, long before the death rate accelerated, we’ve been watching and reading your reports with a queasy feeling. We knew of the measures and plans the Irish government was putting in place to protect us and we knew how far your government was slipping behind.When our taoiseach was closing our schools and universities, your prime minister was still telling you to wash your hands. When our government cancelled St Patrick’s Day celebrations, yours allowed the Cheltenham Festival to go ahead and, with it, a potentially massive multi-day super-spreading event of over 250,000 people. The contrast was disorientating.Nowhere was the dissonance more marked than on the weekend before St Patrick’s Day. By that point, Ireland had banned indoor gatherings of more than 100 people, but had stopped short of closing the pubs. A video showing revellers in Temple Bar went viral a public outcry ensued #closethepubs trended on Irish Twitter the minister for health commented and voluntary pub closures began the following morning.That same weekend, thousands attended a gig in Cardiff: I remember watching the video being posted on Twitter that Saturday night and feeling sick to my stomach. How many people were being infected, at that very moment, singing along to the Stereophonics? I say this not to shame the band their decision to go ahead with the gig was informed by government guidelines. But while their gig was permitted in the UK, it would have been banned in Ireland. I assume there were people in Cardiff who felt the same way I did. The difference was that I was supported by my government. They weren’t.Pandemics grow exponentially, so that infections seem to rise slowly, and then all at once. Every day counts. A week’s delay in mid-March would yield an outsized effect on the deaths to come in April. This means that the contrasting choices of the UK and Irish governments in March mattered.Technically, the UK went into lockdown before Ireland, on 23 March, but Ireland was already operating a “delay phase” from 12 to 27 March. I would argue that the crucial difference in approach lies in this two-week period from 9 March, when Ireland cancelled St Patrick’s Day, to 23 March, when the UK government finally initiated a lockdown. Because the Irish government moved quickly, we seem to have interrupted our pandemic’s exponential curve at an earlier point. In mid-March, our models forecast 3,000 new coronavirus cases a day by the end of the month. In reality, we had a daily increase of less than 300, one-tenth of that predicted. Our government’s measures worked.It’s probably too early to know for sure whether the UK government’s delays, set against the Irish government’s action, made a decisive difference. However, we do know that people in the UK are currently dying more than twice as fast as their neighbours across the Irish Sea. Ireland has also been testing for the coronavirus at twice the rate of the UK (at least). Given that the UK Department of Health’s daily statistics only include deaths in hospitals where there has been a positive coronavirus test, your lack of testing is probably depressing your figures. More importantly, the daily death toll released by the Irish government includes deaths in nursing homes and the community, whereas the UK daily releases do not. EU figures suggest that half of all deaths may take place in care homes, and their exclusion from the daily UK figures is puzzling. If we adjust the Irish figures so that they match the UK criteria, and include only deaths in hospitals, the differences between us are even more stark. In that calculation, almost three and a half times as many people have died of the coronavirus in the UK as in Ireland.The best time to plant an oak tree was 20 years ago the second-best time is now. The best time to stop this pandemic was in January. The second-best time is now. And while we’re working this ground together, it would be good to remember that over the fence, in the neighbouring allotment, Ireland is tackling some of the same problems as the UK. It might be worth taking a peek over the fence sometimes, to see what we can share.• Elaine Doyle is a writer and researcher "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/542613dca2c0b4b194ee260a7205d52b86ddbb8a/1565_62_2111_1268/master/2111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3beb443fda6668b9d32ad6eaba139523","title":"eamonn holmes 5g coronavirus","story":"Viewers who thought they heard the ITV idol link coronavirus to 5G masts can breathe easy: it was they who got it wrong“Just before we go on,” said a desperate-to-go-on Eamonn Holmes at the start of today’s edition of This Morning, “I want to clarify some comments that some of you may have misinterpreted from me yesterday morning …” Classy of Eamonn to blame the viewers, but I’m afraid the mistake – suggesting that a link between 5G rollout and coronavirus ought to be considered – was all his, and this quarter-arsed “clarification” is faintly insufficient in the circumstances. Though arguably the biggest Holmes triumph since he concluded an interview with a rape victim with the words: “I hope you take taxis now.”By way of a recap, this conspiracy theory is seeing real-world impact on emergency communications when they are most needed. At last count at least 30 phone towers had been attacked. The figure has since grown.But who was this heaving into view on Monday morning, with a lofty big-picture take? Why, it was television’s Eamonn Holmes, whose recent (sadly unsuccessful) case against HMRC included himself’s assertion that he is “the best live presenter in the country”, and “not there to follow other people’s rules”. Not even the rules of physics, on this latest evidence.Or as Eamonn bullishly interrupted when This Morning’s consumer correspondent, Alice Beer, was explaining that the rumour was not true: “What I don’t accept is mainstream media immediately slapping that down as not true when they don’t know it’s not true.” Two immediate things jump out there. First and foremost, that we do know it’s not true, as any number of simple and vitally important debunkings have shown. The second eyebrow-raiser is Eamonn’s apparent conviction that a man sitting on the This Morning sofa is not “the mainstream media”, but instead part of some plucky samizdat enterprise where you only hear the good shit. “It is very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative,” continued the Václav Havel of daytime interviews with body language experts. “That’s all I would say, as someone with an inquiring mind.”Mmm. Yet again, the question is what Eamonn might have made of himself if only he hadn’t been held back by such chronic self-doubt. As his autobiography remarks of the two men who gave him his first local TV gig: “I can only hope that TV history judges them as men of vision.”While we’re waiting for the judgment of televisual history, it feels like as good a moment as any to mention that 15 hours after Eamonn’s 5G brain-dump, police and six fire engines were called to a mobile phone mast in Huddersfield. Although it’s not yet known what caused the fire, it not only destroyed emergency services kit, but also posed a threat to occupants of the nearby block flats.Inevitably, people who don’t understand free speech are defending Eamonn. But as Oliver Wendell Holmes (not thought to be a relation) famously remarked, you don’t get to shout fire in a crowded theatre. Furthermore, I think we can all live without a defective free-speech defence of a man who once sent a legal letter to the BBC over a recurring Jon Culshaw impression that saw “Eamonn” given to eating everything in sight, from the programme sofa to studio guest Frankie Dettori. As the punchline ran: “I was fierce hungry, so I was.”Back in the present, ITV is declining to comment. But it was only a fortnight ago that Amanda Holden was also pushing a petition based on the 5G conspiracy (her agent later claimed she’d done so by accident). Given two of its highest profile presenters have now been associated with this arrant rubbish, is ITV going to do any better than allowing Eamonn to blame the viewers?Surely the most elegant – and indeed watchable – solution to it all would be to make Eamonn go on that most sacred of ITV broadcasting devices: a journey. As far as what our hero might discover about himself on this quest, I imagine it would be something similar to what Ron Atkinson learned in the supposedly penitential (BBC) documentary Big Ron: Am I a Racist?The answer to that inquiry, given that Ron had recently been overheard describing a player as “a fucking lazy thick n*****”, was patently obvious: yes. Yes, you are. And I imagine we’d arrive at a similar answer for a programme with the working title: Eamonn Holmes: Am I a Tax-Avoiding Irritant So Inflated By Self-Regard That I’ve Actually Gone and Fanned a Lunatic Conspiracy Theory That is Literally Hampering Emergency Communications Right Now, in the Middle of a Fricking Pandemic?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b02119c4bba407f3e087b30385eb1d9ef85b6b9/0_112_5401_3243/master/5401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5e53a391dc7170b5029723e23226a66","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of retro","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘retro’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘retro’.Share your photos of what retro means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 15 April at 10am.

In the first of a three-part series we speak to Natalie Cassidy, Mary McCartney and more I’m also working on a novel set in the fashion world of both a decade ago and the very near now, but that’s suddenly much harder to work on. It feels, in some ways, almost pointless to write, because we can’t say how scarred we will be as a society when we reach the other side of this thing. Writing the present – novels usually being published 18 months or so after they’re written – feels impossible. How long until we can travel to New York? Do print magazines exist? Will people shake hands still? Details that feel like nothing until you fixate on them.My anxieties led to something else: a desire to do more than I am. I’m working hard to feed my family, and staying indoors like we’ve been told to. But I’m lucky, and many people are not. I had an unpublished novel, K\u0026ampR – a thriller, that’s entirely coincidentally about a family trapped in a house – and decided to sell it digitally, with all proceeds going to charities helping those who need it. The novel came from a dark time in my life maybe this way it’ll be able to do some good.We stopped working a month ago, and the pace of change in my life is incredible. Some actors go job to job, but I started at EastEnders aged 10 playing Sonia, and this year I’ll turn 37. Just like for our audience, it’s odd to see the show close down when you’re part of it: it’s a home from home.It’s hard artistically, I’m worried about the muscles in my brain I use for acting. When I go on holiday, I always feel a bit rusty on returning. Maybe I’ll learn some monologues, look through the plays I’ve got on the bookshelf.All these cancellations have left huge voids in people’s lives, although thankfully – because EastEnders records ahead – our episodes are still airing. But if this goes on for a long time we’ll have to get creative. Maybe we can put something out there ourselves – video conversations between characters maybe?And a decision will need to be made as to whether EastEnders is going to deal with this situation on screen. Sonia’s a nurse – she’d have been on the frontline of this pandemic.I’d been working on an exhibition called Found before this happened – going through my archive looking for natural moments. Suddenly, the pictures that stood out were these moments of affection between two people – simple, casual moments had now become so charged. I’ve been posting them on my Instagram with the hashtag #MomentsOfAffection – because if we can’t have those moments, maybe we can get some solace out of being able to look at them.So far I’ve posted images such as Mark Rylance kissing another actor on the cheek backstage at Twelfth Night circus performers holding hands on a tightrope a couple on a riverboat in Hong Kong where he has his arm around her and she has her head on his shoulder.There’s a picture of my father Paul with his grandson Arthur lying on his tummy. It was taken in 1999 and captures that feeling of true affection. Right now, our situation is the same as everyone else’s – all the generations have landed where they are and everything has been thrown into question. Thank goodness for FaceTime and Zoom.In my studio, the physical work has stopped. I’ve been reading Harriet A Washington, who makes studies revealing that we don’t all breathethe same air. In north America, half the population breathes poor quality air and has asthma and high degrees of mortality. And coronavirus is making this inequality even more obvious – there’s a direct relationship between Covid-19 and the unequal accessibility to clean air.On 25 January, we were in Argentina with a lot of indigenous communities who live on the margins of a salt lake, where there’s huge extraction of lithium. We went up in a black, solar-powered hot air balloon and broke six world records. On it was written: “Yes to life, no to lithium, yes to water.” One tonne of lithium needs 200m litres of water to be extracted, and the indigenous people who live around that area are suffering from the process.When you’re flying in a hot air balloon which is just powered by the sun, you need to be really attuned to the weather. We’re all on board spaceship Earth, and there’s an unequal distribution of the resources. Many of the passengers are disappearing, human and not.There was a beautiful Instagram post from Extinction Rebellion who said that we have to be really careful talking about the diminishing of pollution in relationship with the coronavirus. We have to be attentive and sensitive to the loss of life. Instead of being on Earth together, the virus forces more distance between us. Hopefully, art can engage us in journeys of solidarity and connect us again.When my exhibition in Florence was closed, I didn’t even have the time to think about it – I’m more thinking about the lives of my family and friends in Italy, you know? I read an article the other day about an indigenous population who thought about coronavirus as a portal. If you’re not very careful you can fall in this portal, but if you’re careful it can take you into a new dimension.So I don’t read the newspaper more than two times a day, and I meditate. There’s a kind of media that’s addictive, it affects your ability to think by connecting people in a way that’s not good. Now when we start to digitise the art and move it into a new medium, we have to learn how to navigate the web – things that we thought we knew already.Sirens scream outside my window in New York, all day and all night. I’ll forget for a minute. It’ll start to feel like I’m playing hooky from the most tedious elements of my life: crowded subways, pointless meetings, obligatory dinners I never wanted to schedule in the first place. Then, sirens flood the apartment, and it’s like a glass of iced water to the face.When I ask my dad if he’s well stocked, he says there’s no need! He goes to the store every other day. I stress the importance of going to the store no more than once every two weeks, and I’m met with: “But I live right next to ShopRite!” My lectures feel limp and inarticulate – deja vu of me at 13 outside Claire’s Accessories, failing to convince him my quality of life would improve with a second ear piercing.He says: “You think this is scary – ha! The Islamic Revolution was scary.”I’ve been writing a film about that revolution, and it’s becoming more relevant by the hour. The sirens, the fear, the empty shelves, the new reality that’s no longer relevant an hour later. I’m finally a character in the stories I was raised on. It feels a bit like coming home. Only it’s a terrifying home where your heart lives in your oesophagus, and the threat of loss manifests itself as constant paranoid fear that rings in your ears like a score (the terrifying Mica Levi kind, not Philip Glass).There’s been a lot of noise in my life this past year – around how to be more popular, more palatable. Somewhere, amidst the sirens, the volume on all the bullshit got turned off. I’m feeling a level of joy and gratitude I hadn’t allowed myself. It reminds me of how sex becomes a bit spectacular when you feel you’re on the brink of losing your partner. Perhaps that will be what happens to art? Maybe this will become an opportunity to stop worrying about all the noise and find a way to connect to the core of who we are, why we do this, and what we’re saying.I’m an empathy artist and designer – as far as I know I’m the first in the world. So much of my work is about people coming together, and before Covid-19 that meant in person. I would run empathy workshops or have people collaborate on artworks. I’ve even had politicians playing with balloons in the Finnish parliament.The pandemic has proven a big challenge. But it’s also made me realise that focusing on empathy is more relevant than ever. So I’ve been working overtime to redesign my projects so that they can take place remotely. It’s given a newfound urgency to my work.I’m planning on using digital platforms, like Zoom and Google Hangouts. But I’m also also looking at things like literally phoning people up. I’ve got a tool called the Menu For Conversation, which is a guide to having a conversation that includes bigger questions that might be hard to ask under normal interactions. I’m hopeful people can use this to speak over the phone and connect.We know that loneliness is a huge issue in this country being forced into isolation gives us all a chance to experience what it’s like for a lot of people in their daily lives. I hope we can all develop a sense of empathy that will be much more far-reaching than the current crisis.

Every corner of society is exposed each one of us battling our own problems. For headteachers in England, those problems are multiplied by the anxieties of the 8.7 million children for whom they are responsible.The past month has been brutal for school leaders, and we all need to act cautiously if we don’t want thousands of teachers to be yet another casualty of this virus.It took just nine minutes for the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to change everything. In less time than it takes to hard-boil an egg, Williamson last month told parliament that schools would “close until further notice”, that national exams were cancelled, that schools would continue caring for vulnerable children, and children of keyworkers – even during the Easter holidays – and that all pupils on free meals would continue to be fed.Headteachers went from running an ordinary school to organising a virtual school, a childcare centre and a food delivery service. They had two days to turn it around. Education was never the sole focus of schools, and it’s a shame it has taken a pandemic to prove it.Ten years ago, heads may have found it easier. Under Labour, education was managed by a large and well-funded Department for Children, Schools and Families – a title the Conservatives mocked for its length, and which some, such as the then education secretary, Michael Gove, disliked because it suggested schools should focus on child welfare. He wanted to get back to concentrating on discipline and academic rigour, the sort of words that get booming rounds of applause from rightwing audiences.Hence, Gove’s first act on becoming education secretary, was to change the name back to the Department for Education, and then to set fire to almost every initiative related to children’s wellbeing.For a decade, headteachers have felt every budget cut to children’s services, and endured every slice to the cash pot for psychologists, nurses, or a school police officer. They have felt every hour they have had to spend coordinating help for a child after Children’s Trusts were disbanded. “Don’t worry,” they were told, “it’s not your job.”Except, of course, it was. Cancel schools, and look: who is there for children with protection orders? Who is feeding the vulnerable? Who is writing mass bereavement policies to explain to year 4 why their teacher isn’t coming back? Who is (virtually) sitting with the sobbing kid whose GCSEs have been cancelled?Teachers. Gove may have taken the words “families” off the wall and decimated budgets, leaving little in the pot for welfare, but schools never gave up on helping. In families’ hour of most desperate need – when the government failed to quickly deliver its national food voucher scheme, when its promise of online resources was slow and limited – school leaders stepped in to make these things happen.Of course, heads are well-paid professionals with prized job security, and 12 million parents have now taken on the burden of home-schooling alongside trying to keep or find a job. Amid these difficulties, the wellbeing of school leaders is no one’s main concern. But survey data shows a third of heads are working longer hours than before (they already did 60-hour weeks), most are still regularly attending school, and alcohol use is creeping up as a coping mechanism. Let us also remember the average age of a headteacher is 50, meaning many are at higher risk if infected with Covid-19.Talking to school leaders, many are at the edge of their nerves. Some will leave, more will stay – and those who do will likely find a new zeal for fighting back.To get ahead, the government should make two moves. First, it must accept that schools cannot return to a situation where slashed budgets mean leaders scrimp on soap and mental health services are impenetrable. Austerity has had its day.Second, ministers must resist pressures to whimsically bounce schools back into service. Anyone who thinks proper social distancing can be done in a full (or even half full) school has either never met a child, or been in a school. A properly planned and clearly communicated return is the least everyone is owed.Finally, I would implore everyone, parents, governors, the entire public, to go easy on schools. They cannot be perfect at this time. Children will be upset about cancelled exams. Not every school can stay open for Easter. One may have sent home a whizzy digital learning package, another may have sent textbooks and a wish of good luck. When the world changes in nine minutes, it rarely changes equally. No one is having an easy pandemic. Let’s hope it is over soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55045921714791a289a4c790b0d7e431b9458b64/0_92_3008_1806/master/3008.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab3a1d013b529fa72b163c91a7cfbb0f","title":"turn you daily walk into a nature home school","story":"Whether making a wildflower bracelet or searching for badger footprints, here are some simple, enjoyable ways to start teaching your kids about natureIf there is one thing to be grateful for at this awful time, it’s that it is unfolding (in the UK, at least) in spring. Even if indoor life feels as if it has been put on hold somewhat, the natural world has other ideas. Much-loved woods and rambling spots may be out of bounds (unless you live by one), but whether you live in the city or countryside, you can turn your daily exercise into a way of connecting with nature. The benefits for mental health are well-documented, and if you’re attempting to home-school, it could become the most enjoyable lesson of the week.“There is something about slowing down and enjoying the nature in your neighbourhood,” says Kate Lewthwaite, a citizen science manager for the Woodland Trust. “We may jump in the car and whiz past it to get to a national park, but nature is all around us. Take time to appreciate what’s on your doorstep – it’s there, but we don’t often stop to notice it.” If you are lucky enough to have trees on your street, give them a bit of your attention. “Most of them will be coming into leaf right now, and some will be flowering. They may not be the biggest or the most exciting trees, but they’re there all year providing oxygen, taking pollution out of the air and providing shade. We often don’t even notice them, but they do us amazing amounts of good.”Stopping to study a tree for 10 minutes may not be strictly adhering to the guidelines for being outdoors for exercise, but you could take a photo to look at later. “There are good apps, such as iNaturalist, and the Woodland Trust has a ‘Tree ID’ app to identify it later,” says Lewthwaite. “Take a moment to notice what its bark is like. Are there any insects? Are there leaves coming out? Just take that extra time as you pass to say: ‘Thank you, tree that I’ve walked past every day and don’t normally notice.’”“Get a bit of duct tape or parcel tape and put it around a child’s wrist before you leave, sticky-side out,” says Dawn Isaac, the author of 101 Things for Kids to Do Screen Free. “They can pick up things and stick them to it on the walk, and they have a decorated bracelet by the end of it. It really makes children look for what’s out there: leaves, seed heads, flowers … all sorts. You could colour-theme it.” Once home, go online to try to identify what you’ve found.If you are in the park or on a footpath, turn over a stone or bit of fallen branch. “You could look for the number of different types of tiny creatures you can see,” says Lewthwaite. “Are they long with lots of legs? Are there worms? How many different kinds of invertebrates can you spot?” She recommends looking for birds who are doing the same – turning leaves over to hunt for insects. Once you’ve finished looking under a stone, turn it back over. “There is lots of active insect life at the moment. It’s one of the best times of year to be out for a walk.”Look out for bees, says Andy Beer, the author of Every Day Nature, and the National Trust’s director of the Midlands. “The queen bees and early bees are out and about, and ing into blossom. They’re collecting nectar to feed themselves up after a winter of hibernation. Spending a little time watching the bees is a lovely thing to do.”If it has been wet and there is a bit of mud, it can be exciting to spot tracks and try to work out what animal made them. “Even if it’s a dog’s paw print,” says Lewthwaite. Look for clues – was it a big dog or a small one? You can also spot bird footprints. If you’re lucky enough to live close to some woods, “you might see some deer tracks”, says Lewthwaite. “There is guidance online to tell badger, fox and dog prints apart.”Collect twigs, leaves and flowers “as you go along, to make a collage when you get home, bearing in mind wildflower-collecting rules”, says Lewthwaite. (Don’t uproot the plant or pick any part of any flower if it’s in a special conservation area.) You could do some bark rubbings. Hold a piece of paper against the bark of a tree and rub over it with the side of a crayon. Back at home, says Isaac, “try to identify the bark, then cut those bark rubbings into the shape of the leaf of that tree”. Or do leaf printing: cover the surface of a leaf with paint, then stamp it on a sheet of paper.Look out for interesting things – feathers, blossom, a dead insect, pine cones (although let’s hope we’re not still in lockdown in the autumn) – and create a nature table at home, identifying and labelling your finds. If you have a magnifying glass, you can take a closer look at invertebrate anatomy or go online and look up all the parts that make a leaf and what they do. You can also create a nature journal – a diary of observations and sketches. Spring is the perfect time to start one, and you can keep it going all year, tracking the changes outside.Lots of butterflies are emerging now, such as peacocks, small tortoiseshells and brimstones. The brimstone, says Beer, “is often the first butterfly on the wing in spring time. They’re the easiest butterfly to learn because they’re our only bright yellow ones. There are other yellow butterflies that fly in from Europe, but they’re very rare.” You should be able to see a brimstone in the city or the countryside: “Anywhere where there are enough gardens and parks.” Some of the next butterflies to emerge are orange-tips (look at their wings – the clue is in the name). “They’re harder to see. They never stop, so you have to chase after them.”At this time of year, birds are still nesting, so watch out for this behaviour. “You may see birds collecting sticks, twigs and bits of moss,” says Beer. “A bird hopping around on the ground then flying off with things in their mouth is nest-building.” If you groom your dog or have started cutting your own barnet, leave the hair outside for the birds to use. “They will use anything soft to line their nests.”All the birds are arriving from Africa this month, adds Beer. “The ones you may particularly recognise are the swallows and house martins. You’ll see house martins start to make little cup-shaped mud nests under the eaves of houses.” So look up when you’re out on your daily walk. “They’ve flown all the way from south and west Africa to spend their summer with us, and are here until September.”“There are some flowers it’s OK to pick. Dandelions and daisies are two,” says Beer. “They’re suddenly all out, and they like being picked – daisies in particular are lawn plants, they like nothing better than being cut – you’ll just get more daisies.” Teach your children how to make daisy chains. We’re so used to thinking of dandelions as weeds that you may be surprised if you take a moment to study their dazzling yellowness. Dandelions are also edible, although always take expert advice if you are in doubt about the safety of anything you have gathered. Pick leaves and flowers away from busy roads. Leaves can go into salads or pesto, and the flowers in tea or to brighten up dishes – it’s a good opportunity to introduce children to the idea that food doesn’t just come from a supermarket."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32fd9c7d132a208ae4f7469dec8b8eccec533b44/0_374_5611_3367/master/5611.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8a0d88981c83f28b5ffcd80d07975abb","title":"blackfishing black is cool unless youre actually black","story":"From Kim Kardashian to Selena Gomez, the perceived trend for wanting to appear black shows no sign of slowing down On Monday night Interview magazine dropped their new cover on Instagram – a hyper-urban shot of singer Selena Gomez with her tongue sticking out, dressed in black boots, leggings and a Balenciaga X-Rated top. On her head the singer sported a braided hairstyle with baby-hair edges. The hiic Gomez also appeared to have a darker complexion than she would normally have. “She is done letting people control her narrative,” the magazine wrote in the caption below. And yet the cover image styling appeared to show the singer appropriating from another culture completely. “This is blackfishing y’all wake up,” read one comment under the cover image, while the website Pop Crave tweeted the question: “Why is Selena Gomez trying to be black …” – featuring pictures from the Interview shoot.From the rapper Bhad Bhabie, who appeared on Instagram last week deeply tanned and in a black wig, to the styling of Ariana Grande in her 7 Rings video (she had worn “culture as a costume” according to the Atlantic), “blackfishing” has become an all too familiar cultural trope. The term was coined to reflect a perception that you are cosmetically enhancing your appearance through makeup and hairstyles to appear as if you have black heritage. “It’s about picking and choosing common black traits and characteristics for one’s benefit,” explains Johanna Yaovi, the founder of The Curl Talk Project, “while we continue to face discrimination on a day to day basis. “As black women, we are constantly fighting for clear, authentic representation and ersity and then have to face iniduals who do blackfishing, iniduals who will therefore look ambiguous enough for brands to use them as emblems for ersity.”Last month Kim Kardashian, a figure who some commentators have accused of normalising blackfishing, was called out for wearing braids at Paris fashion week with Twitter users asking: “Can you please stop appropriating black culture?” In December, Kardashian drew criticism for her appearance on the cover of 7Hollywood magazine, which saw her sporting a Diana Ross-like wig, dress and a darker complexion. Karen Attiah, the Washington Post’s global opinions editor, tweeted: “I don’t see it as complicated. Her proximity to and appropriation of blackness has gotten her (and her family) paid. Handsomely.” (Kim and Khloé Kardashian have a combined net worth of $400m, while their younger sister Kylie Jenner has been named by Forbes the youngest billionaire in the world). “It’s America’s obsession with blackness, and black culture – without black people,” she added.In November, Love Island’s Molly Mae Hague was questioned after using a foundation that was many shades darker than her natural skin tone. Many Twitter users found it troubling that she was turning her skin into a darker shade than it was naturally, comparing her to Rachel Dolezal.“I do question the motivation behind some people’s excessive use of tanner,” says the journalist Wanna Thompson. “Do I believe that every person who tans wants to be black? Not particularly, but I do wonder about the need to make yourself appear several shades darker. Who are you trying to emulate?” Thompson came up with the term “blackfishing” when she saw a discussion about white women cosplaying as black women on Twitter. “And I said to myself, ‘I need to bring awareness to this growing issue’. “It’s always been prevalent,” Thompson says. “Be it fashion, beauty or music. Black is cool, unless you’re actually black.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a07ec1cabbf9536db8666d9ddf1d9608ac762351/0_247_3901_2341/master/3901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dbf78185ce523ecfae5df2f11d2ecbbb","title":"jane horrocks wearing a tight latex dress felt brave and liberating","story":"The actor on how Absolutely Fabulous led her to modelling for sustainable label Vin + Omi, and how her children helped her to reinvent her style When Vin + Omi first asked me to model, it was at a time when I was trying to do things that I had not done before and not be so much on repeat. Their whole thing is about sustainable fashion – “Stop fucking the planet” is one of their slogans. This look was from their autumnwinter 2018 show and the sash on my waist says: “We are not sheep”. They use a lot of recycled latex. On a personal level, I would never, ever usually wear a tight latex dress! So to wear it in front of a fashion audience felt quite brave and liberating.I am coping very nicely with lockdown. I wear boyfriend jeans and a bright coloured tracksuit top every day, but I am still showering. I lost touch with my sense of style when I became a mum because my priorities changed and my children took my focus. I just didn’t have the same interest in what I looked like. When my children became teenagers and they started to be interested in fashion, I saw it as an opportunity to reinvent my own style.

As well as ruling that the national lockdown would remain in place until 11 May, it was announced that no festivals would be allowed to go ahead until mid-July at the earliest.The festival had already announced that it would no longer stage its annual event in its traditional mid-May slot, suggesting it was hoping to reschedule events for late June and early July. At the time, Cannes president Pierre Lescure had said he was “reasonably optimistic” the 2020 event would go ahead, after suggesting the coronavirus pandemic would peak “at the end of March and that we will breathe a little better in April”.Cannes still appears to hold out hope that the festival can operate in some form this year, saying they will “explore all contingencies” to make “Cannes 2020 real, in one way or another”.“Many uncertainties are still reigning over the international health situation.

Any ideas for using them up in delicious ways?Miles, London SE25Fair point, well made, Miles: everyone’s looking for smart ways to eke out supplies at the moment, and veg trimmings are no exception. As chef Skye Gyngell explains, “You can use a heck of a lot more of a fruit or vegetable than you might think: there’s loads of goodness in those skins, stalks and stems, and they’re just as flavourful as the rest.” Make sure they’re well washed, though.We’re in the hungry gap right now, and while pickings are very much on the slim side, veg offcuts aren’t only of use in the stock pot. Gyngell, whose London restaurant Spring offered a daily “scratch” menu made from so-called “waste produce”, uses carrot, parsnip and swede peelings, say, in a simple slaw: “Toss with yoghurt or creme fraiche, olive oil, a squeeze of lemon, honey for sweetness and season. You’ll be surprised how good it is.” If the mood takes you, add toasted spices or nuts and any herbs to hand – the stalks really come into their own here – and serve alongside grilled chicken or fish, or on a baked potato.Tired green veg – spinach, cabbage, whatever – limp lettuce and herb stems can be repurposed into a salsa for grilled meat or fish, or to toss through yoghurt as a dressing for roast veg or eggs any which way. “Steam the greens with a couple of garlic cloves until they wilt,” Gyngell says, “blitz, then braise slowly with a glug of olive oil, some chilli, cumin and a big pinch of salt, until all the water evaporates. It keeps for ages in the fridge.” Add chopped preserved lemon andor black olives to the mix, and you’ll have a deeper, more complex sauce that you’d never guess was made with stuff that’s more commonly destined for the compost.Professional kitchens, of course, have always been masters of using up every last odd and sod. Jane Baxter, co-owner of Wild Artichokes in Kingsbridge, Devon, laughs at the memory of the “fridge soup” they knocked up at one of her first cheffing gigs back in the 1980s: “All sorts went into it, from knackered lettuce and cabbage to leek tops and spring onion ends. We called it ‘lettuce soup’ on the menu, and no one ever guessed what it was made of.”The likes of beet, radish and kohlrabi tops, meanwhile, can be treated just like any other greens, Baxter says. “Southern Europeans have been cooking them like this for centuries. Wilt them in a little oil, flavour with onion, garlic and any spice you fancy, and you have a brilliantly frugal side or toast topping.”Broccoli stalks are great grilled: “Chop them into batons, stick in a toastie maker or dry pan until slightly charred, then dress with oil, vinegar, salt and pepper while they’re still hot, so they absorb all the flavours.” As for cauliflower leaves, “A friend showed me how to turn them into crisps a few years ago and now I never throw them away: toss in oil, season, sprinkle with your favourite spice – fennel seed works brilliantly – bake in a medium oven for 20 minutes, and Bob’s your uncle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76efa0e2a657a73b70ec40a4031e4801785e72ed/0_209_4784_2872/master/4784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da525efd8aa09ae8973756ae0d3836ed","title":"lionesses make collective donation to playerstogether fund","story":"England Women’s football squad have announced a collective donation to the PlayersTogether fund.The fund was established after meetings between Premier League players to discuss the best way to support the NHS through the coronavirus crisis.The Lionesses confirmed the move in a coordinated statement released on the social media accounts of the players at 7pm.“After discussions with a number of Premier League players, we are delighted to confirm that the whole of the Lionesses squad will make a collective donation to the PlayersTogether fund,” the statement read.The fund was established by Premier League players including Jordan Henderson and Harry Maguire in the wake of widespread criticism of the perceived inaction of top stars.The fund’s contributions will be managed in conjunction with the umbrella group of NHS charities, NHS Charities Together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74f6c0d1f646a16d89c536b2277325f0a927c3c7/0_0_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f759160a0783274ac2a6335483ca62b","title":"newcastle owner mike ashley in advanced talks to sell club for 350m","story":"Mike Ashley’s controversial 13-year ownership of Newcastle could soon be over. A sale to a consortium fronted by the Yorkshire-born financier Amanda Staveley has been broadly agreed and documents lodged at Companies House last week provide concrete proof that advanced negotiations are well under way.The paperwork suggests the proposed £310m deal involves Ashley apparently loaning Staveley’s company PCP Capital Partners £150m in an attempt to get an agreement over the line. It is understood that in reality Staveley is taking on a £110m interest-free loan the retail tycoon had made to Newcastle but the club will be purchased outright.This complicated transaction is reflected in Companies House papers which create a legal scaffolding enabling the ownership handover to proceed through a transfer of shares.Three years ago Newcastle’s owner called Staveley “a time waster” after the collapse of an attempt to purchase the club but the new documents confirm she and Ashley have agreed a £13m deposit.Puzzlingly, and perhaps significantly, the Saudi investment is not mentioned in the Companies House documents made public on Tuesday, although Reuben Brothers’ involvement is detailed. However it is understood PIF, whose role is likely to be the subject of not merely Premier League but government interest amid sports–washing and human rights concerns, remains part of the consortium. It is believed PIF intends to help fund urban regeneration on Tyneside.Ashley bought Newcastle for £133m in 2007 but his willingness to transfer his subsequent £110m loan to Staveley to facilitate a sale was confirmed in a “registration of a charge” at Companies House. A charge is the security a company gives for a loan.Newcastle’s owner has long been known for driving the hardest of bargains but the coronavirus crisis has been extremely bad news for his retail empire and he now seems keen to offload Newcastle. The club declined to comment on the latest developments.The Premier League has received the necessary paperwork from both parties and is understood to be initiating the mandatory owners and directors test. The sale is contingent on both the governing body’s blessing and the finalising of the deal’s small print.Given the logistical difficulties imposed by the current lockdown the Premier League test process could take up to a month to complete. When, and if a satisfactory conclusion is reached – and providing Ashley does not change his mind – then Yasir al-Ramayyan, the governor of PIF, is expected to become Newcastle chairman. There could also be a seat on the board for Jamie Reuben, the 32-year-old son of David Reuben, although he would first need to resign his current directorship of QPR."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eccb154fa2ca2fedc153092443baf21df18684c/90_68_4125_2475/master/4125.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d49e7683ea5c855ba82a4a3988daaf3d","title":"why have the uk and germany taken different approaches to covid 19 testing","story":"In February, the UK and Germany were taking a similar approach to testing for coronavirus.

A club that do not have contracts with their players and whose priority is the organisation and everyone involved in it rather than the first team stood alone the last time they were first promoted to English rugby’s second tier three years ago. But their model is set to be copied by others as the financial impact of the coronavirus lockdown deepens.“The finances of the Championship simply don’t work,” says Steve Hill, Richmond’s director of rugby for the past 10 years and first-team head coach. “With the cuts to it that will be made by the Rugby Football Union, more clubs will have to look at our model. Outside Ealing Trailfinders, who have a wealthy backer, virtually all are losing money and it cannot continue. You do not want clubs going out of existence but we are in danger of that happening as things stand.”Richmond’s two-season fling in the Premiership ended in 1999 when their backer pulled out and they dropped to the bottom of the league pyramid. They are trading places with Yorkshire Carnegie, who survived last season at the expense of the south-west London club after parachuting in players to help them to avoid relegation. Yorkshire controversially retained their status after agreeing a company voluntary agreement with creditors, having piled up debts of more than £500,000. This season Yorkshire have lost all 14 league games, are set to leave Headingley and are reverting back to being called Leeds.“I suppose it made our promotion doubly sweet,” Hill says. “The RFU told us Carnegie were going to be very competitive this season. We knew that would not be the case, but 12 months on we really enjoyed our season in National Division One, a cracking, incredibly competitive competition. We were not the favourites to win it, with some clubs paying a lot more than our match fees . The highest payers hit trouble and lost players, reinforcing my belief that rugby beneath the Premiership needs to be reset.“More teams will have to become part-time. There is no other way if rugby is to become financially sustainable. All sports will have to consider how and where money is spent. If rugby goes back to the days when clubs invested in facilities, coaching and creating a really good social atmosphere, that will attract players because they will not be able to do so by offering money. Some of the amounts being offered at level four and below are ridiculous: a lot of that will now have to disappear, which will be a good thing.”Like all clubs, Richmond have had to make adjustments as income all but stops but they have not had to furlough players who hold full-time jobs in spheres ranging from teaching and recruitment to carpentry and sourcing film locations for production companies. “We pay a match fee and it is the same whether you have played 150 matches for the club or are making your debut,” Hill says.“There are no contract negotiations and no one talks about money when they are having a meal after a game. They have proper conversations and I do not envy rugby directors who have to pick certain players because they are on big money. I can say to any new player that if they are good enough, they will be in the team it is a powerful recruitment tool and I would struggle to explain to someone why another player was worth twice as much as him. ”“I do not know how many of Saracens’ superstars will face us but anyone who plays for them is outstanding: their academy is second to none. It will be a fantastic occasion and we are looking forward to the away games at Cornish Pirates and Jersey, great weekends. We will stay over in Jersey and have a night out. We are not going to change as a club because we are in the Championship: ethos, environment and spirit are far more important than where your first team play.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d16cf543d237c363da103b8223c4ab4068c29909/0_154_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7b82ba1a7edc03197fb87e90f51ca19","title":"sam and tom curran would rather play cricket behind closed doors than not at all","story":"England’s Sam and Tom Curran have said they would be happy to resume their international careers behind closed doors if necessary. “Every sportsman would love to be playing now, whether it is with fans or not,” said Sam in a joint video interview with his brother. “I definitely wouldn’t mind playing behind closed doors.”With the Covid-19 outbreak wiping out huge swathes of the international calendar, and large gatherings of people not a realistic prospect for at least several months, the Curran brothers have added their voices to the growing chorus of players and coaches endorsing the resumption of professional cricket without crowds as soon as it is safe to do so.“Playing internationals behind closed doors will be a strange thing, but I guess at least there would be some sport on TV for people,” said Tom. “Once it’s all safe and we’re abiding with government guidelines, whatever decisions are made for us, I’m sure everyone will be getting amongst it. I’m very excited to get back out there, whenever that might be.”During the national lockdown Sam is staying with his girlfriend in Somerset and Tom is in his London apartment, which has slightly restricted his bowling opportunities. “I can’t quite come off the long run on the balcony,” he said, joking. “We are just making do. It’s not the same as bowling but we’ve got medicine balls and when I go for a run on the road, I slow it down and go through my action a couple of times, just to keep the movements going. Pretty village stuff.”Instead, Sam has been busy raising money in other ways. This month he launched a fundraising campaign for the NHS charity Help Them Help Us, with donations nearing £10,000. Simon Harmer, Dom Sibley and Dan Lawrence are among the prominent cricketers to have contributed.“We’ve just got to appreciate what they’re doing,” Sam said. “We’re all sat at home having a nice coffee when there’s people working long shifts and that’s when we realise how lucky we are in what we do. We’ve had so much time to think about what we can do to give back. The smallest thing we can do is raise some money for the NHS.”On the field, there are complementary ambitions at play. For Sam, securing his place in the England Test side will sit alongside seeking to establish himself in the white-ball setup. For Tom, a mainstay of the white-ball side whose two Tests came on the last Ashes tour of Australia, in 2017-18, the focus is on working his way back into red-ball contention, a difficult task given he has played one first-class game since September 2018.“I’ve definitely got huge Test ambitions still,” he said. “It’s a tough one, because over the last couple of years there was a focus on white‑ball cricket with the World Cup, and rightly so. Now it’s about trying to get that balance.”Sam agreed: “The dream is to be playing all three formats together. Any game you play for England is obviously a great privilege, but playing with your brother gives it that extra special feeling.”As centrally contracted England players, Tom and Sam have been receiving regular communications from the England and Wales Cricket Board’s strength and conditioning coaches, as well as from their county, Surrey. Group yoga sessions organised over FaceTime have helped to maintain team spirit. “I’m just trying to keep as busy as possible,” said Sam. “Hopefully I’m not one of the players who has let themselves go, and comes back 10kg too big.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb3012689fb32ddb51a06174943eac6b9c3d57b2/0_99_4706_2825/master/4706.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1165a05876537a6baae53a85a874c48","title":"patsy ferran on treasure island national theatre at home","story":"As the National Theatre’s 2014 staging of the classic adventure is streamed online, its star remembers her breakthrough year• Hottest front-room seats: theatre and dance to watch online• The best arts and entertainment during self-isolationTreasure Island came in a whirlwind year: you left Rada, acted opposite Angela Lansbury in Blithe Spirit and then starred in this huge show at the National.It all hit me after the fact. I remember a coffee break during Blithe Spirit where I went: “Hang on, I’m being paid to do this now?” For years, acting had been a hobby or school plays or training. Being in a rehearsal room with other actors, trying to tell a story – that was always the goal. Then I was working with Angela Lansbury! On Treasure Island I was on stage in almost every scene. I didn’t have time to know what the significance of it all meant. I would have had a meltdown if I did. It was seeing a show at the National’s Olivier theatre – Coram Boy, on a school trip – that made me know I loved theatre. I was thankful that I worked with such incredible people. That’s the main thing: if you’re with a good group of people, everything else fits into place.Had you read Robert Louis Stevenson’s book before?I hadn’t but I read it as prep. I’d expected it to be quite twee but I was very wrong – it was far darker and more thrilling. Polly Findlay definitely aimed to recreate that in her production. Even though it’s for kids, the book is very violent and quite scary in parts. There is a joyousness in Bryony Lavery’s adaptation that balanced those things out. I was relieved that I liked the book: I’d just said yes to the role without knowing much about the novel because it was such an amazing opportunity. Thank goodness they decided to make Jim Hawkins a lady.The production is directed, adapted and designed by women, with you as Jim. How much did you talk about gender roles in the rehearsal room?Throughout rehearsals we didn’t have a single conversation about the fact that it was a story about a girl. Polly wanted to stress the fact that it’s just a good story. Jim just happens to be female. It reminded me of an experience at drama school when I played a mum in her 40s in Jane Bowles’s play In the Summer House – we never talked about her age in rehearsals, we just tried to tell a story as truthfully as possible. By not putting the spotlight on it we were able to tell the story without an agenda.The Olivier theatre is huge. How did the size of the stage affect your performance style, especially as Jim switches between narrating and being in the story?The Olivier is such a muscular space. I’d stood in the back row watching shows as a student. You need to have the back row and beyond in your brain when you’re expressing yourself. I had an amazing voice teacher, Jeannette Nelson. As the narrator I could speak directly to the person in the back row. It’s a harder job, technically, to pretend that they’re not there while also making sure that they can see you and you’re involving them in what’s going on in the scene. It can be a difficult space, but when it works, the Olivier is kind of magical. Every play you do is an experiment. It’s easy to forget that. If you try to get it “right” that’s probably when you start to fail. I remind myself of that in everything I do. Just try something new – if it fails, you’ll learn from it.What was it like to act on Lizzie Clachan’s fantastic set?My initial reaction to the set was that it was the best design I’d ever seen. It was so exciting. Fast-forward to tech and I was terrified I’d fall off! There were trapdoors here and there and I was climbing up rigging. I’ve never slept so well because it felt like an obstacle course I was going through for two hours. I became very fit doing that job. The revolve stage is very cool. You feel slightly superhero-like, standing still but moving on and off. But jeez, I was running up and down everywhere. I had no time to think. It was: go through this, crawl under that, e through a trapdoor!Do you enjoy the sea or are you a landlubber?Oh my days. I am probably the most scared person you’ll ever meet. I want my feet firmly on the ground. I do not like water. I can appreciate the sea from the land. My family love to swim. I’ll be by the pool dangling my feet in the water and looking after the towels. That’s why I like theatre – I can pretend that I’m braver than I actually am."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dacae5954e324c0255f34ecb7f8f775b431f162c/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=204de82fd489f14135e866ad0e9d50b5","title":"tiktok is the social media sensation of lockdown could i become its new star","story":"With families and couples filming themselves dancing or performing skits, the app has become even more popular in recent weeks. I asked its British stars to help me get startedAndy Warhol predicted a time everyone would have 15 minutes of fame. He was nearly right – it is actually 15 seconds. That is the maximum duration of a video clip with music (non-music clips can last up to a minute) on TikTok, the video-sharing platform that has taken the world by storm. Favoured by under-25s, who make up its core audience, TikTok this year surpassed Facebook and WhatsApp as the world’s most downloaded non-gaming app.What makes it stand apart from Snapchat or the now defunct Vine is one crucial difference: the closely guarded algorithm that produces the app’s opening dashboard. Unlike other apps, this home screen is not full of people you are following. That is because the algorithm searches for new clips rather than pushing already popular ones. Translation: you don’t need lots of followers to go viral. It is this tantalising prize that gives the app its USP, and what keeps TikTokers ticking over.But how easy is it to become a TikTok influencer? I decided to try my hand at becoming TikTok’s next big thing, with the help of some of the app’s current British stars.I am not a total TikTok novice, having tuned in almost daily for a year. I like the food and travel videos, as well as young female comedians (in particular Brittany Broski and ChiwithaC). Mostly though, I’m in it for the cat videos. (I’m not the only one: the #catsoftiktok hashtag has 5.9bn views.) In fact, my first foray into creating TikTok content was a (now deleted) video of a kitten grooming. I filmed it on Instagram, added a filter to give it a heavy-metal soundtrack and flames to make it look as though the cat was headbanging. Hilarious, right? It received a handful of views and no likes. Later, while complaining to a friend’s little sister that headbanging cats is objectively great content, I was instructed that the issue was using the wrong hashtags and not using a TikTok filter.Her explanation tells you a lot about TikTok culture. The app, which launched in 2016 in China under the name Douyin  with a focus on lip-syncing, was specifically designed with teenagers in mind. The hashtags invite you to take part and set challenges. Any user not sure what to create has not only topics but tools at their disposal, from image filters to options to use other users’ music or visuals.I start by figuring out what is popular in the hope that I can ride the wave. As usual there is a dance challenge, currently #blindinglights, which sees people do a set sequence to a song by the same name from the Weeknd. But as dancing is not my strong point, I pass. Luckily, nearly all the other current trends are related to lockdown. As I too am in lockdown, I smell an opportunity.I try out the tools by using two clips I already have. First, using my clip of a fox yawning in my back garden, I’ll shoot myself looking bored around the house. Then I’ll add music so it looks as if the yawning fox is singing. For my second video, I’ll try a traditional “hands in pans” food instruction clip. I have a video of a big box of Cornish fish I received from relatives, as well as pictures of the process of prepping, portioning up and freezing it. I know haddock storage doesn’t sound the most appealing subject for the under-25s, but I need something.That is when I encounter my first hurdle. The great illusion of TikTok is that the best content is off the cuff. Some is, but for those who do TikTok seriously, it is a craft. I was shocked by how long my first few videos took. I needed to convert all my pictures into short videos, then find a song that delivered the right high note, at just the right moment, so it would look as though my yawning fox was singing – genuinely one of my most tricky journalistic assignments. The hours I spent honing my little clip was no surprise to Arshdeep Soni, AKA @arshsoni10, a 24-year old TikTok user with 6 million followers. “Sometimes I stay up until two or three in the morning,” he tells me. Based in Shepherd’s Bush, London, Soni performs magic tricks on his TikTok. “There’s a lot of work that goes into it. Planning ideas, rehearsing the right tricks for the right moment, then editing the video. Then I have to figure out the best time for me to post. There’s lots of tactics.”Soni posts on other platforms, including Instagram and YouTube, but his biggest audience is on TikTok. When he is recognised on the street, “it’s usually TikTok”. His TikTok reputation helps him get corporate bookings, but he is beginning to generate income working with brands such as Burger King to promote their products, as well as record labels who pay him to use certain songs in his clips in the hope others will borrow that music – and so on – until it goes viral. Indeed, TikTok’s influence on the music industry is huge. It is seen as an incubator for  smash hits and a way to turn lesser-known artists into stars: Lizzo’s Good As Hell and Doja Cat’s Say So became hits after being repeatedly used in clips on the site while Lil Nas X’s Old Town Road was popularised through a viral dance challenge. Soni’s passion for magic shines through on his clips. I realise that if I want to be a big TikToker, I need a focus. I choose “London lockdown nature moments” as my subject. I figure that seeing flowers, bees and beautiful trees thrive in the green spots near where I live is exactly what people want to see.I check on my first two videos. Weirdly, fish storage is outperforming the fox. I pull together another video from clips and pictures of a walk I had taken in a secluded wood as part of my government-approved walk. A friend gives me a tip about some nearby fields and I plan to head there the next day for my daily exercise.. But when I wake up, I feel camera shy. I had not worn makeup in the previous posts and am suddenly self-conscious.“I try to go makeup-free, or not look so great some days,” says Abi Else, AKA @aaaaaaaaaabi, a 22-year old TikToker from Brighton who focuses on style. “I think it’s important that younger people know that it’s fine to not look perfect all the time.” Pressure to conform to certain beauty standards is one of a range of pressures women face online their appearance is often targeted in the abuse they receive. And TikTok has come under fire after reports that moderators were told to suppress videos from ugly, obese, poor and disabled users. TikTok claims the policy was to prevent bullying and has since changed its guidelines.Else, however, says her 80,000 followers are “really nice ... When I’ve had videos go viral, that’s when all the hateful comments come in. I think a lot of the time it’s because it’s a young audience. They don’t understand that it is actually someone on the other side.”She tells me that it is important to engage with your audience and let them get to know you. Else likes to ask her audience questions so they feel part of the clips. I shoot a video of me in a tree with a fact about London’s green spaces so that my new followers (all two of them) can get a sense of who I am. The next day I find it is my best performing video so far. Well, after the one about fish.If anyone can tell me about how to build an audience based around personality, it is Perrin Hooper, AKA @persworld, an 18-year-old TikToker with 380,000 followers. Hooper’s style is to talk straight to camera and muse on life – a video diary with the odd dance thrown in. Hailing from Cornwall, Hooper says: “Where I live, social media is your main way of reaching out.”Hooper spends roughly three days a week working on TikTok, and the rest of the week is spent running an Etsy store selling pendants and other crafts. Recently, Hooper – who uses the pronoun they – has started producing and selling their own merchandise, a project they are working on with their mother. Mum does the “nitty gritty, stuff like costs, margins, packaging” while Hooper takes care of the creative side of things.Despite its focus on young people, TikTok as a family business is not uncommon. One of the most famous TikTok families is the Harfins (@refelicity) – AKA Felicity and her sons, Finlay and Harrison – from Edinburgh, Scotland. Their 1.8 million followers watch the family play pranks, dance, cook and generally muck about. Felicity, a former marketer, runs the account and has helped to turn it into a business giving clients – from Mattel to the Brits – the chance to be mentioned or promoted in their videos. Indeed, it is now Felicity’s main job. But it was the boys who initiated the project. “They grew up watching videos online and always wanted to create themselves.” It took them years to persuade her. “I didn’t realise how much fun it was going to be.”Felicity says that TikTok has given them “something creative to do as a family”. But the Harfins are often recognised in their daily life – and her sons are growing up internet-famous.“They’ve had to learn younger than most about behaviour in public. People film them, so they’ve learned not to do something they’d be worried about being put online.”I am curious about Felicity’s opinion on TikTok’s safety protocols, which have been the subject of sustained criticism from children’s charities. The concerns centre around how quickly inappropriate content spreads, owing to the very algorithm that defines the app. One such example is the #kidnap hashtag, which saw boys pretend to kidnap girls or girls pretend to be kidnapped. It’s acting, but such graphic themes are usually the preserve of 18-rated movies, not a fleeting challenge of schoolchildren.“I don’t think that criticism is limited to TikTok,” she says, noting that YouTube is “far worse” and that TikTok has “sorted out” a lot of its problems. TikTok recently raised the age for using its live broadcast function from 13 to 18 after it was reported that predators were using the feature to groom children. It has also added functions such as restricted mode and family safety mode, which allow parents and children’s accounts to be linked.After we speak, Hooper sends me some suggestions to improve my ratings – they advise I try a voiceover so people can hear me and to shoot vertically rather than in landscape. I have a brainwave. What better way to show TikTok more of myself, focus on nature and join in with the stay-home trends than with a guided tour around my garden – from the cherry tree to the chewed-up slippers the foxes leave each night. Given the time, skill and expertise of the people I have interviewed, I’m not sure I’ll be able to cut it as a TikTok superstar any time soon. But I don’t mind, as long as I can some day beat the 375 views of my frozen fish.

But why? Fiona Cowood investigates ...First love, first kiss, first job, first car … it’s easy to transport yourself back to those heady experiences, even though decades may have passed since they happened. Contrast that with a simple question about what you did last Wednesday … can you honestly remember?Meik Wiking runs the world’s only Happiness Research Institute in Denmark, and in his latest book, the Art of Making Memories, explores the hold that first experiences have over us.“First experiences stick better to our memories,” he says. “Several studies show that we are better at remembering the novel and the new, the extraordinary days when we did something different.” This helps to explain why, as we get older, we might have dozens of treasured memories from our youth while our present flashes by with perhaps only a house move and a holiday memory-banked for safekeeping. Wiking refers to this phenomenon as the “reminiscence bump”, AKA “the good old days” – that period from 15-30 that is the source of so many of the stories we tell about ourselves.“Firsts in my 40s are rarer than when I was 15,” says Wiking, “but that’s why I seek them out now. First experiences are able to stretch the flow of time – they can help stop the feeling that the years are going by quicker and quicker.”“When we’re out of our comfort zone, we make sure we record every aspect of the experience in case we need to retrieve the memory later on,” he says. “For example, we might not know if the situation is safe or dangerous so we open up our senses to pick up all the signs and signals.”First experiences also serve as building blocks, helping us to construct a solid sense of who we are in the world. Any parent will know how much children love being told the stories of their first steps, or their first trip to the swimming pool. Those moments are insights into identity-building, as kids make sense of how they got to where they are today. As we get older, these “firsts” become bookmarks that distinguish between chapters – who you were before a major breakup, versus who you became, for example.“Each of us has an ancient and universal human need to be seen and to be remembered,” says Wiking, “and firsts, and changes of scene, play an important role in organising autobiographical memory.”To avoid the mid-years of your life becoming a depressing blur of chores, childcare and days spent at the same desk, Wiking advocates opening yourself up to new experiences to ensure a steady imprint of new, vivid memories. Memorable grownup firsts can come in all shapes and sizes – from big, bucket-list adventures in far-flung places to practical, domestic endeavours, like hosting your first Christmas or driving your first electric car.And making these little adjustments not only enriches your own life but will positively affect others too, says Wiking. “One of my biggest ‘a-ha’ moments in writing the book was going from a perception that memory is something random that we don’t control to realising that my memory – and that of my friends and family – is actually something I can influence. Realising I can influence what my friends remember in 10 years’ time is very empowering. It makes you want to do new things – and share those experiences with others.”You’ll always remember your first EVUnlock the thrill of a game-changing first for yourself with the New Renault ZOE – the ideal first electric car.

Forecasts suggest a medium-term crossover point, probably towards the end of this decade, where the car industry is making more EVs than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Against that, there still exists a great deal of scepticism in the minds of consumers.“An EV wouldn’t work for me because …” is a familiar conversation starter. It’s true, there are some people for whom an electric car is simply a non-starter – but that number is a vanishingly small percentage of the population. For most, an EV is going to be a money saver that makes no obvious impact on lifestyle.Emily Rice, Renault UK’s product manager for electric cars, answers three readers’ questions.I live in a terraced house and park in the street, so I’m unable to have a home charging point. What are my charging options? Elaine Hills, BrightonAlthough it’s true that many current EV owners like to charge their cars at home using a dedicated wall-mounted charger in their driveway or garage, the good news is it’s far from the only option.The charging infrastructure to support EVs is constantly growing and evolving. For instance, it was reported in May last year that 1,076 new residential EV charging points had been installed in London as part of the Go Ultra Low City Scheme (GULCS), and this figure continues to increase. Virgin Media recently began a pilot project to convert its broadband cabinets into charging points, with a view to eventually providing 40,000 EV charging points across the UK. Elsewhere, there are initiatives such as the MK Promise, through which Milton Keynes council offers to install, within a short walk, an overnight charging point for all new EV owners lacking access to private parking.Access to a public residential charger is, however, still rare, and the much more common practice is to charge at the other end of a regular journey. “If you’d like to buy an EV, but don’t have the ability to charge it at home, check whether your workplace has charging facilities,” says Rice. “It’s common to simply not notice charging infrastructure if you don’t own an EV – but once you start thinking about switching, you really start to notice how many charging points are around you.”It’s worth noting that the notional “full charge” is an ICE hangover, driving until the warning light comes on and then filling the tank. Getting a full charge in Sainsbury’s or Starbucks may take a few hours – but with EVs such as the New Renault ZOE having a driving range of 245 miles*, it is unlikely you will need to find somewhere to charge every day, so owners aren’t arriving with the (usually metaphorical) needle in the red.If you charge an EV and then don’t use it, have you wasted your electricity? Jonathan Bailey, SheffieldThe short answer is: no. Or rather, not really. “The thing people tend to ask about is leaving their car when they go on holiday,” says Rice. “If you leave your car at the airport for a couple of weeks, you’re not going to notice a discharge. There’s lots of inbuilt technology in a Renault ZOE designed to ensure the batteries are as efficient as possible. Even if you leave your EV sitting around for a few months, it’s not going to be an issue for the traction battery.”The concern allied to this is the idea that battery performance will be less impressive as the vehicle gets older. While battery capacity can drop as the vehicle gets older – it won’t be to the extent it did a decade ago when the technology was in its infancy.“I think a lot of people worry that the battery in an EV is like the one in their phone, and they’re going to see the performance decline after a couple of years – but it really isn’t like that,” says Rice. “We all know that a phone reaches a point where you’re having to charge it a couple of times a day – but the technology in the lithium-ion battery of the car is far superior to that. If you’re driving it in the same way as a petrol or diesel car, you’re not going to experience any problems with an EV. We know it’s an area of concern, though, which is why Renault gives its EV batteries an eight-year or 100,000-mile warranty**. Hopefully that inspires confidence in the technology.”Is it more difficult to get a problem with an EV car resolved because there are fewer expert mechanics? Edward Jones, NorthamptonshireThe downside is that most of these technicians are employed by mainstream dealerships, with relatively little EV expertise in backstreet garages. EVs are, however, selling in ever-larger numbers, and mechanics are not immune to market forces. More technicians will train on EVs because, slowly but surely, that’s where the market is heading.Curious to learn more about EVs?

Ahead of what is certain to be a historically isive general election fight, the former president called for “Americans of all political stripes” to come together in a “great awakening” behind the presumptive Democratic nominee.“Joe has the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery,” Obama said in his endorsement video.The announcement was Obama’s most extended public commentary on the 2020 election to date. In his remarks, he emphasized Biden’s preparedness to lead the country in this perilous moment, delivered a blistering attack on Republicans, and sought to unify the party in the wake of a fractious primary.“Pandemics have a way of cutting through a lot of noise and spin to remind us of what is real, and what is important,” Obama said. “This crisis has reminded us that government matters. It’s reminded us that good government matters.”The former president remains incredibly popular among Democrats and his active support for Biden could play a key role in energizing and consolidating the party around Biden’s candidacy, which still lacks a spark of enthusiasm even as he racked up a string of commanding primary victories.Obama declined to play a public role in the primary, which Sanders’ departure from the race last week in effect ended, elevating Biden to presumptive nominee. In his remarks, he praised the rivals Biden defeated in the Democratic primary, which he said featured “one of the most impressive Democratic fields ever”. Singling out Sanders, Obama said the Vermont senator was an “American original” who would be critical to defeating Trump in November.When Sanders exited the race, Trump tried to sow discord by questioning why Obama had not yet endorsed Biden.“It does amaze me that President Obama hasn’t supported Sleepy Joe,” the president said during a coronavirus briefing, speculating that his predecessor “knows something that you don’t know, that I think I know, that you don’t know.”In a statement on Tuesday, the Trump campaign suggested Obama was somehow reluctant to support his former vice-president, with whom he shared an uncommon friendship and whom he awarded the presidential medal of freedom in 2017.“Obama has no other choice but to support him,” said Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager. “Even Bernie Sanders beat him to it.”In 2008, Obama assembled a coalition of African Americans, suburban women, white working-class voters and, crucially, young people in what many Democrats remember as one of the most inspirational campaigns in modern history.Biden has drawn support from similar constituencies but is missing a key part of that coalition: young people, who remain deeply skeptical of his candidacy.To the dismay of some Democrats, Obama has mostly continued the tradition of former presidents by not criticizing his successor, even as Trump has dismantled his legacy on everything from healthcare to climate change. In the midst of a pandemic, Trump has sought to deflect criticism by blaming his predecessor.On Tuesday Obama did not mention his successor by name, instead assailing the party Trump leads and implicitly criticizing him with praise of Biden.“One thing everybody has learned by now is that the Republicans occupying the White House and running the US Senate are not interested in progress,” Obama said. “They’re interested in power.”Biden’s association with Obama helped propel him ahead of younger rivals. His eight years as Obama’s No 2 contributed greatly to his support among African American voters, particularly in South Carolina, the foundation of a remarkable campaign turnaround.His time as vice-president was also central to his argument that he is a capable, experienced leader best positioned to beat Trump in November.Obama made a similar case in his endorsement video, citing Biden’s leadership during the Great Recession, as well as his management of the H1N1 and Ebola crises.Healthcare proved to be a flashpoint during the primary, with candidates ided between expanding the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature achievement, or seeking universal health coverage.Biden has resisted Sanders’ Medicare for All plan and advocated for building on the ACA, nicknamed Obamacare.In his video, Obama said it was time to “go further” and ensure that all Americans have access to healthcare, calling on Democrats to push for a public option, expand Medicare and “finish the job so that healthcare isn’t just a right, but a reality for everybody”. Biden, who has pledged to choose a woman for his vice-president, told donors on a fundraising call that Obama advised him to choose someone who is not afraid to disagree with him and who will “always tell me the truth”.“The most important thing – and I’ve actually talked to Barack about this – the most important thing is that there has to be someone who, the day after they’re picked, is prepared to be president of the United States of America if something happened,” Biden said at the virtual fundraiser."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/406e166dd8ac8cac851403c823bcaddbd38f6915/0_141_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d31ee8a92ce596950a781bd13ebe4a5","title":"us bidet toilet paper sales coronavirus","story":"The stress hoarding is forcing Americans low on toilet paper and ‘bidet curious’ to finally purchase one – and to some, it’s even a pandemic lifehackI had been “bidet curious” for years. But it wasn’t until my husband sent me a photo of the ransacked paper products aisle at the supermarket that I finally decided to take the plunge.A couple of days later, I got a text from a friend running low on toilet paper. I told her about my recent bidet purchase. Minutes later she messaged me again: the company I suggested was backordered through the end of the month.It seems that America, too, has discovered the bidet.In the first week of March, “we saw sales starting to double what they had been the month prior”, said Jason Ojalvo, CEO of Tushy, a bidet company founded in 2015. “Then two days later they were triple what they usually are, and then suddenly it was 10 times what normal sales are. A few days later it peaked at a million-dollar sales per day.”Owing to shelter-in-place restrictions across the country, families need more toilet paper at home. While previously they used the bathroom at work, school and restaurants, they are now going at home. The type of toilet paper in short supply are luxury brands – double-ply and made of virgin fiber – as opposed to the single-ply recycled paper that businesses tend to use.Rather than chasing rumors of where toilet paper was last seen on shelves, some millennials see purchasing a bidet as a kind of pandemic lifehack. Kaitlyn Braswell, a management analyst in Chicago who ordered hers a few days ago, is looking forward to what she describes as a new level of cleanliness. She only wishes she had ordered it sooner – it’s expected to ship in mid-May.In Italy, where bidets are in every household, the American rush for toilet paper remains a mystery. It’s completely unthinkable that American bathrooms would be without such an essential piece of equipment. As far back as 1975, a hygiene law stated: “For each accommodation, at least one bathroom must be equipped with the following sanitary facilities: toilet, bidet, bath or shower, washbasin.”America’s disdain for bidets has no clear basis. Douching was once thought to be a kind of birth control, and in 1936 an onlooker suggested that “the presence of a bidet is regarded as almost a symbol of sin”, according to the Atlantic. One convoluted theory  holds that American soldiers in Europe during the second world war visited French brothels and saw the basins, which they instantly associated with prostitution. Today the stress hoarding of toilet paper has become exactly the incentive that many people needed to make a decision they may have been mulling for years.For Brandon Krajewski, a film-maker living in Los Angeles, a combination of the rumored paper shortage and Tushy’s marketing convinced him to wash instead of wipe.“We had a bidet experience several months prior while staying at an Airbnb and liked it. Once we saw all the toilet paper flying off the shelves, we realized we could reduce our costs and paper waste.”Tushy isn’t the only bidet brand seeing an incredible spike in sales. Business Insider has reported that Brondell is “selling a bidet on Amazon every two minutes, or about 1,000 units per day”. The demand for some of the bidet attachments that Hygiene for Health sells has doubled over the last two weeks.The timing could be a boon for the environment. Trees are a carbon sink, and a (controversial) study published last year claimed the world has the capacity for at least another trillion trees, which could mitigate climate change. If Americans gave up toilet paper, they could keep 15m trees from being turned into pulp every year. Instead of deforesting Canada’s boreal forest, one of the largest carbon stores on the planet would be preserved.Bidets can, surprisingly, also help conserve water. Manufacturing one roll of toilet paper requires 37 gallons of water, Scientific American has reported. Some bidets, by comparison, use one-eighth of a gallon a flush. Also contributing to toilet paper’s carbon footprint are the hundreds of thousands of tons of chlorine required to make toilet paper white, the energy required in the manufacturing process, the single-use plastic that it gets packaged in, and the fuel for shipping .Now quarantined at his house in Madison, Wisconsin, Josh Faulkes, manager of the Wisconsin Society of Cytology, said the pandemic has changed the bidet from a fantasy item to a necessity.“This situation moved the product from a ‘one of these days’ luxury item to a more practical purchase, up there with replacing our back door and changing our tires.”Though he views ownership of a bidet as entirely practical, Faulkes is actually splashing out and getting one with warm water, a heated toilet seat and a warm air dryer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88c415fb4e5578aa486ab1d4de6e15c35662303b/0_16_1934_1161/master/1934.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9e993fa32a14ba961db091d34bcf9c1","title":"bangkok water festival venue before and during coronavirus","story":"Photographs taken in Bangkok before and since the coronavirus outbreak show the emptied locations of the city’s annual water festivalIn Thailand the Songkran festival was cancelled nationwide to combat the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Unless there is some enormously larger amount of herd immunity than we’re aware of … the majority of the population is still susceptible.In its daily briefings, the UK government has not outlined plans beyond the current restrictions, but the latest paper adds to a building scientific consensus that physical distancing may be required for considerably longer in order to keep case numbers within hospitals’ critical care capacity.Papers released by the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) in March suggested that the UK would need to alternate between periods of more and less strict physical distancing measures for a year to have a plausible chance of keeping the number of critical care cases within capacity.The prospect of intermittent distancing raises difficult questions about what guidance will be given to high-risk groups, including over-70s and those with compromised immune systems.It may be possible to relax distancing measures periodically while maintaining cases within a volume that health services can cope with, but the grave health risks of infection to some people will remain the same until a vaccine or highly effective treatments are available.New treatments, a vaccine, or increasing critical care capacity could alleviate the need for stringent physical distancing, according to the paper in Science. “But in the absence of these, surveillance and intermittent distancing may need to be maintained into 2022,” the authors conclude.The overall numbers of cases in the next five years, and the level of distancing required, were found to depend crucially on the overall current levels of infection and whether all those who are infected gain immunity and, if so, for how long. The authors cautioned that these are big unknowns and that a precise prediction of the long-term dynamics is not possible.If immunity is permanent, Covid-19 could disappear for five or more years after the first outbreak, the paper suggests. If people have immunity for about a year, as is seen for some other circulating coronaviruses, an annual outbreak cycle would be the most likely outcome.Asked to speculate on which of these scenarios was more likely, Lipsitch said: “Reasonable guesses are that there might be partial protection for close to a year. On the long end, it might be several years of good protection. It’s really speculative at this point.”Under all scenarios considered, however, the models found that a one-time lockdown would result in a resurgence after restrictions are lifted.Serological surveys, assessing the proportion of the population carrying protective antibodies, will be crucial to establish whether people have long-lasting immunity.Other teams have found evidence that the immune response varies across people, with those who only have mild or no symptoms showing a far weaker response.Prof Marion Koopmans, the head of virology at the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, whose team is studying the antibody response of those infected, said complete and permanent protection would be unusual for a respiratory virus.“What you would expect to see – hope to see – is that people who have had it once … the disease would get milder,” she said before the latest paper was released.Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, said: “This is an excellent study that uses mathematical models to explore the dynamics of Covid-19 over a period of several years, in contrast to previously published studies that have focused on the coming weeks or months.“It is important to recognise that it is a model it is consistent with current data but is nonetheless based on a series of assumptions – for example about acquired immunity – that are yet to be confirmed. The study should therefore be regarded as suggesting possible scenarios rather than making firm predictions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak on Tuesday include:The International Monetary Fund slashes its forecasts for global growth and warns of a slump in output this year unparalleled since the Great Depression of the 30s. In its half-yearly forecasts, the IMF says the “Great Lockdown” is likely to cause a dramatic drop in activity that will be far more painful than the recession that followed the banking meltdown of the late 00s.A further 778 deaths are recorded in hospitals in the UK, taking the total to at least 12,107, the country’s Department of Health and Social Care says. The true extent is likely to be greater because the data do not include deaths in other settings and many National Health Service trusts are still collating figures from over the bank holiday period.New York’s hospitalisations fell slightly on Monday, the state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, announces. “We think we are at the apex,” Cuomo says, adding that 1,600 new people came in to New York hospitals. The decrease is attributed to people recovering and being discharged.Italy, Spain and Austria allow partial returns to work as countries across Europe report further falls in new cases and begin taking the first cautious steps out of lockdown to revive their battered economies.According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 1,945,055 people have been infected and 121,897 have died since the outbreak began. The institution collects its data from official releases and media reports.Mary Lou McDonald, the leader of Ireland’s Sinn Féin party, tests positive for Covid-19. She says she is no longer deemed to be infected or infectious and hopes to return to work next week. She was tested on 28 March and received the result on Monday, a two-week wait reflecting delays and glitches that have plagued testing in Ireland.China reported 89 new cases on 13 April, down from 108 the previous day. The state broadcaster had reported earlier that 79 of the day’s imported cases were in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang, which shares a border with Russia. Hubei province reported zero new deaths and cases.As Moscow tightens its lockdown measures, Russia reports its highest daily infection figures yet. In a video conference with officials on Monday, the president, Vladimir Putin, said the next weeks would be “decisive” for Russia’s fight against the virus as the situation “is changing practically every day, and unfortunately not for the better”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b62b0be33caedbcf26d9975af79f8672061e39ec/0_79_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d17b22bc71985d79d7fb09926095985e","title":"facebook friendships can help predict covid 19 spread study finds","story":"Data from early hotspots in US and Italy suggests social network could help identify at-risk areasThe spread of Covid-19 can be predicted, in part, through patterns of Facebook friendships, according to a study from researchers at New York University.The researchers looked at the progression of the disease from two early hotspots, in suburban New York, US, and Lodi province in Italy, and found that the spread was strongest in those areas that had significant links to the regions through the social network.The results hold, the authors say, even when controlled for obvious connecting factors such as wealth, population density and geographical proximity. They could help explain why the virus spread the way it did, as well as suggest ways to prevent future community contagion from getting out of hand once lockdowns are lifted.When it comes to Westchester County, the suburban New York cluster, for instance, “coastal regions and urban centres appear to have both high levels of connectedness to Westchester and larger numbers of Covid-19 cases per resident,” but there are specific hotspots in popular holiday locations for “many well-heeled residents” of the county, such as coastal Florida near Miami and ski resorts in southern and central Colorado.For Lodi, meanwhile, a particular link shows up in both Facebook friend data and spread of Covid-19 cases to Rimini, a popular seaside resort on the Adriatic.But not all connections hold, suggesting that Italy’s early lockdown helped matters. There are strong links in the Facebook data between Lodi and several provinces in southern Italy that “send workers and students to the industrial Lombardy reason”, the authors write, but “while some of these areas have seen a number of Covid-19 cases, they are not disproportionally larger, perhaps reflecting the efforts of Italian authorities to restrict the movement of iniduals”.The research was based around a new tool the authors built in conjunction with Facebook, called the Social Connectedness Index. The dataset allows researchers to measure the connectedness of two geographic areas, as represented by Facebook friendships, without needing to access the raw social graph itself, which could infringe user privacy or allow for a re-run of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The Index is now available for other academics and non-profits to use for similar research.“This finding suggests to us that the geographic structure of social network as measured by Facebook may indeed provide a useful proxy for the type of social interactions that epidemiologists have long known to contribute to the spread of communicable diseases,” the authors write.The research highlights the power such massive datasets offer to epidemiologists. At the current stage of the outbreak, such insights are less useful, but in early and later stages, when the number of new cases is low or declining, being able to know which geographically distant locales might be at risk when a new cluster occurs could be more useful.Facebook has made a number of such datasets available as part of its Data For Good programme, but has been wary of handing user data directly to governments and public health authorities, who might want access to more granular data. Mark Zuckerberg said in mid-March that, if asked, “at a high level, the answer is probably no, but it’s sort of a hypothetical, because no one is asking for this”.Instead, governments have turned to other data sources. In the UK, mobile phone companies have been asked for aggregate data derived from phone towers, while the US has worked with the mobile advertising industry to take location data there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9120135735635cc190a20ab9826cd0393349970/0_166_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a503f5bee13f51ab68c34ff46fbd339","title":"justin trudeau coronavirus canada shutdown remain weeks","story":"Prime minister said ‘we’re going to have to remain vigilant’ until vaccine is found as infections climb across the countryJustin Trudeau has warned that Canada’s economic shutdown is likely to remain in place for weeks, as coronavirus infections continue to climb across the country.“I know people are interested in when things will go back to normal. The reality is, it’s going to be weeks still,” the prime minister said on Tuesday. “It is going to be important to get our economy going – but we’re going to have to remain vigilant until such a time as a vaccine is found.”Trudeau’s measured comments come in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who has grown increasingly frustrated with the protracted slowdown of the American economy and has clashed with state governors over deciding when measures will ease.On Monday, the US president told reporters that his administration was “very close to completing a plan to open our country. Hopefully, even ahead of schedule.”The Canadian economy has also ground a halt in recent weeks following advice from health officials to lock down much of the country, prompting the government to pass billions in temporary aid. Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for the government’s relief measures, which provides C$2,000 (US$1,400) for four months.But while health officials are optimistic that early action by the country’s provinces may have avoided crisis-level admissions to hospital seen in New York City and much of northern Italy, Trudeau nonetheless cautioned that much of the risk was still present.“We must remain in this phase for some time to come,” he said. “We are not on the other side of the curve at this point. We’re not through this first wave of Covid-19.”He also suggested that the border with the US would remain closed to all non-essential travel for weeks to come, calling it an “extremely important” measure of curbing the spread of the virus.As of Tuesday, Canada had recorded more than 26,100 cases of the coronavirus and 823 deaths, many of which happened at long-term care facilities.Trudeau extended his condolences to families that have lost loved ones in retirement homes.“We recognize the tragic and terrible stories that have come out of long-term care homes. We know we need to do more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/890daee65c910657a1ccdb30566b1c8ae06098ce/0_58_3425_2055/master/3425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1aa181c34544139ba800c3e4ca55e140","title":"paramedics and pet clinics how stranded britons are helping out","story":"UK nationals unable to get home during coronavirus are supporting communities from India to GuatemalaStranded on cyclone-hit islands in the south Pacific, in locked-down towns in India, and in distant parts of Guatemala, Britons are helping support local communities.The UK government’s coronavirus rescue operation is under way but with many of the estimated 400,000 Britons marooned overseas in far-flung regions subject to travel restrictions, some are preparing for weeks and even months abroad while others anxiously await repatriation.On the storm-torn island of Espiritu Santo in Vanuatu, a three-hour flight off the north-east coast of Australia, 67-year-old paramedic Nich Woolf, from Somerset, is volunteering on ambulance crews and rescuing the injured from the wreckage left by category-5 Cyclone Harold.“The situation is dire now and their economy could be completely destroyed,” he says. “My mission is to carry on supporting the paramedics here and to just get through till more volunteers can come.”Woolf had originally planned to volunteer for two months but because of Australian flight cancellations, along with the imposition of a state of emergency in Vanuatu, he was unable to return home.Coronavirus is not known to have reached the 65-island archipelago, but Wolf is helping Vanuatu prepare for a possible outbreak as work goes on to repair homes, schools and public buildings.“I’m at much greater risk travelling back than staying in Vanuatu though it’s pretty tough here – we have had many days without running water and the electricity has gone. Everything is pretty fragile.” In Guatemala, which suspended all flights a month ago, Britons have been offered buses from popular tourist areas to the Mexican border, where they must arrange their own travel to the nearest airport.“The British embassy is not offering me any more assistance than I could find myself,” says 27-year-old Catriona Spaven-Donn from Edinburgh who is working for an NGO in Nebaj, 200 miles from the Mexican border.She has decided to continue her humanitarian work with a charity which is fundraising during the lockdown to help young indigenous women gain scholarships to nearby schools. “We are doing phone check-ins with the families we work with and distributing food and hygiene baskets,” Spaven-Donn says. “We are also doing story-hour transmissions twice weekly on a community radio station in Spanish and the indigenous Mayan language, Ixil, along with offering psychological services over the phone.”Others elsewhere have also continued their work to help local communities. Clara Nowak, an animal welfare charity director, is overseeing emergency rescue work in Pushkar, Rajasthan – where her organisation looks after more than 400 injured animals in a specialist hospital – amid an increase in dogs with bite wounds.“With only four hours notice of the lockdown we struggled to get in supplies of food and medicine, but there have been lots of kind donations from the community,” she says. “We’ve found we’re admitting more dogs with bite wounds as they compete for limited resources as there are no tourists and restaurants have shut.”Emergency daily clinics are being run for poorly animals owned by locals, mostly goats and cows and pets. The prices of essentials such as flour have risen and Nowak is helping provide her staff with food packages.Aside from her work, the lockdown has given her time to bond with her son and delivered a memorable 42nd birthday last week which was celebrated with Marmite chapatis after their flights home were cancelled. She is now waiting to be allocated a flight to facilitate her return home to Gloucestershire.Just north of Casablanca in Morocco, a retired British couple from Cambridge travelling in a motorhome have tried twice to return by ferry but it was full the first time they arrived and then they broke down en route to the second planned voyage.“We are gradually coming to terms with the fact that we are going to be here for some considerable time,” says retired languages teacher Andy Brown, 67, who is with his wife, Sheila, 65, in the absence of ferries to Europe and uncertainty over whether they can drive cross-country.However, they are enjoying the simplicity of their life. “Sheila has her sewing machine and is in the process of making a dress and we have a short set of golf clubs to play pitch and putt,” he says, adding that they enjoy entertaining their grandchildren on long video calls.“We also spend a lot of time talking and supporting each other on the campsite,” Brown adds of his French and German motorhome neighbours, after the Chinese contingent shipped their vehicles and returned home by plane on Thursday.A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We know it’s a difficult time for many British travellers overseas, and we are working around the clock to bring people home.”They said the government was working with airlines around the world to ensure as many people as possible could get commercial flights home and that planes were being chartered from India, South Africa, Peru and elsewhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2eed1731272d41f762a25f7241f90d5a27d926e/1_0_4997_3000/master/4997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=205913d925ca00427c4093723e2f08e7","title":"should everyone be wearing face masks","story":"No robust evidence ordinary masks stop wearers getting infected but some experts say they could make a big difference In recent weeks, face masks have become an unremarkable sight in streets and supermarkets.Many people are choosing to cover their mouth and nose with online-bought or homemade masks or scarves, in spite of the advice of the World Health Organization and, in the UK, from Public Health England, that they are no protection against coronavirus.Yet one country after another has decided to depart from the WHO guidance and rule that masks should be worn – most notably the US.To add to the confusion, on Monday, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, said the UK position on masks was under review and would change if the scientific evidence warranted it.This followed remarks by David Nabarro, a UN special envoy on Covid-19, who appeared to depart from the WHO’s line by suggesting the UK would have to get used to wearing masks.“The virus isn’t going to go away and we don’t know if people who have had the virus stay immune afterwards,” he told the BBC, adding: “Yes, we will have to wear masks.”Despite the mixed messages, the WHO guidance updated a week ago, has remained consistent.It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” it stated.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.Underlying WHO’s concerns are the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.There is also concern the public will not understand how to use a mask and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Most of all, there is no robust scientific evidence – in the form or trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them.N95 masks, worn by doctors and nurses who are treating people with Covid-19, certainly do. But the virus particles are thought to pass through other types of mask.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected by the virus.It is accepted that they can block the transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play if everyone wears them.In the US, Donald Trump has advised people to wear masks whenever they go out, while stressing it is not compulsory, citing advice from the Centers for Disease Control. In France, the Academy of Medicine has recommended the use of a “general public” mask – to differentiate it from the mask used by healthcare workers.There is now increasing pressure for the UK stance on masks to change. Even marginal gains could make a difference is at the heart of the argument.Prof Trisha Greenhalgh from the Nuffield department of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, and colleagues wrote a paper published by the British Medical Journal last week that argued in favour of “the precautionary principle”.The standard level of scientific evidence is no good in this issue, she told the . Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard in drug development, but not appropriate to face masks in a pandemic, she said.“The point is we have now got a hugely complex issue going on. The last thing we need is a controlled experiment. We need to follow the logic of complex systems,.”Greenhalgh thinks the whole population of the UK should wear masks – just as they do in South Korea, where the epidemic curve is far lower than ours.We could make that acceptable, she said, by making it fun – encouraging people to make and personalise their own.Even if masks do not become the norm, it is quite possible they will anyway become part of the strategy for the exit from lockdown, at which point not only will every possible way of preventing new infections be considered, but the public will be so keen to resume “normal” life that it is hard to imagine anyone refusing to comply."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9bf564630e839c242632b7d8e77224a86cc0653/0_154_3824_2294/master/3824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af55910e63d8d98350ed8cf86aa316d4","title":"uk coronavirus rules autism learning disabilities lockdown","story":"People with learning disabilities or autism can leave the house for exercise more than once a day and can travel outside of their local area under current lockdown measures, the government has said.The guidance, which had previously stated that non-essential workers should only leave their homes once a day for exercise or to shop for basic necessities, was amended on Wednesday.Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 40 million Americans relied on food banks to get enough to eat. Now, the demand for emergency food aid is growing exponentially as millions of people lose their jobs.\u0026nbspAs this demand grows, food banks are receiving far fewer donations from retailers as people are buying in bulk, so stocks are low. This means food banks must buy more supplies to make sure they have enough to feed every hungry American asking for help.The Feeding America network of 200 food banks secures and distributes 4.3 billion meals each year through 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. They help vulnerable communities including the elderly and disabled, as well as providing free nutritional lunches for school children from low-income families.If you want to help,\u0026nbspfind your local food bank, and go to their website to donate. You can also donate to Feeding America’s Covid-19 response fund.Food banks rely on volunteers, and Feeding America and food pantries across the US urgently need help as most regular volunteers are senior citizens who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. If you are interested in becoming a new volunteer, use\u0026nbspFeeding America’s tool to find your local food bank or pantry but please get in touch with them first before showing up. Remember, if you’re worried about your own health or the risk to a family member, “stay home” is the advice.Feeding America also says you can help in small ways like following your local food bank on social media and sharing what they are doing online, or by becoming an advocate for the fight to end hunger in America.The updated advice reads: “If you (or a person in your care) have a specific health condition that requires you to leave the home to maintain your health – including if that involves travel beyond your local area – then you can do so.“This could, for example, include where iniduals with learning disabilities or autism require specific exercise in an open space two or three times each day – ideally in line with a care plan agreed with a medical professional.”Although those with autism and mental health conditions are advised to limit their travel, and stay as close to their local area as possible, carers and support workers who do not live in their household can accompany them.The change comes after lawyers from Bindmans LLP and 39 Essex Chambers were asked for help by two families with children on the autistic spectrum.Bindmans said one of the children, whose conditions mean it was necessary for them to leave the house more than once a day for their wellbeing, was deliberately taken to a quiet location outside of their local area because of their particular needs.The firms argued that the “inflexible policy”, which also says people should stay two metres apart from anyone outside of their household, disproportionately impacted those with certain health conditions and was “therefore unlawful and discriminatory”.After the amendment was made to the guidance, one of the affected families said they were “delighted” they could support their son’s needs “without breaking the rules”.A spokesperson for the Cabinet Office said the most important action the public could take during the pandemic was to stay home to prevent the spread of Covid-19.But, it added: “We understand that this will be more difficult for some, that is why we clarified the guidance regarding the needs of those with specific health conditions such as learning disabilities or autism.”• Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire I am a Leaving Certificate student and in recent weeks we have been clamouring for clarity\u0026nbsparound the fate of the 2020 exams. The announcement last Friday by Minister for Education Joe McHugh was meant to provide this.Unfortunately, the announcement has created more questions than answers. It has merely kicked the can down the road. Students deserve clarity - but the volume of unanswered questions is creating fresh uncertainty for many of us.1. When will the exams start, exactly? There’s still no official start date for the exams, the first time in living memory this has happened. This in and of itself screams of uncertainty which was meant to be ended by the announcement.The exam timetable is now not going to be released until June. How could it possibly take this long?2. What impact will this have on students’ mental health?Two more months of added stress, anxiety and pressure on students for exams that are still not guaranteed to go ahead in July or August. Students are now being asked to study through the summer with no added motivation, considering all their upcoming plans such as holidays, concerts and sporting events have now been thrown out the window.What toll will this have on students’ wellbeing and mental health? Has this even been considered?3. Will the digital ide grow wider?The two-month extension only further exacerbates this issue with the chasm between the advantaged and disadvantaged growing even further.Courses are still incomplete and are in all likelihood not going to be completed at this stage.4. What happens if teachers refuse to return in July?There is currently no deal in place for teachers to return to schools in July. What if the unions oppose this idea? The ASTI has already stated that “no teacher will be required to do anything. The proposal from the Department of Education cannot be enforced”.Students’ futures could end up being used as a bargaining chip.5. Is two weeks really enough to catch up?The proposed two-week period in class before exams isn’t enough time to get anything of significance covered. It’s not even a day for each paper. It needs to be a much longer period than this.Students generally want the two weeks directly before the exams to cram in as much as possible. They don’t want to be in class three or four days out from the first paper. So, the proposed period of students being back in class should not be the weeks directly preceding the exams.As a result, there is a very real chance that many students will choose not to turn up for these classes.6. No date for practicals or projects has been givenWill these eat up the proposed two weeks that we’re supposed to be getting in class?I’m aware of students who do four subjects (engineering, technology, construction and art) all with outstanding practicals or projects left to be completed. And if practicals proceed, how is social distancing going to be implemented in these settings? Take construction, for example: students need to regularly move around the room sharing the same tools and pieces of equipment for a period of four hours.7. What happens if a student feels the onset of symptoms during the exams? Under current guidelines, this student would be required to self-isolate for 14 days. By the end of isolation, the exams would be over. This could open a can of worms wherein any student who doesn’t want to sit the exams can claim they have the symptoms and there would be no way to prove otherwise until they have been tested.8. Uncertainty for students who test positive for Covid-19 before or during examsWith the tight timeline currently proposed, these students would have no chance to sit their exams at a later date. Therefore, it’s not hard to envisage a scenario where infected students continue coming to exam centres as they fear missing out on their dream course.Also, how are we going to deal with the problem of students who are infected but asymptomatic? A student could potentially be carrying this virus and infecting other students and invigilators for up to 14 days unbeknown to them. There is no way to safeguard against this.9. No room for assisting bereaved studentsBeginning last year, students with a bereavement in their family could sit the exams a month or more later than everybody else. That can’t happen now with the tight timeline currently being proposed.10. Potential shortages of teachers to mark their examsThere’s already anecdotal evidence on social media of teachers withdrawing their correcting applications as they’ll be back to work in the final week of August and won’t have time to correct exams.Even if they manage to find enough teachers willing to correct the exams, there’ll be a lengthy delayed return to school for other students as their teachers will be marking exams when schools are set to reopen.11. How will invigilators assist students?A record number of invigilators being needed is already a huge challenge but getting these extra invigilators to supervise in the month of August could prove a stretch too far. How will these invigilators walk around the exam centre and carry out basic functions such as answering students’ queries and handing out extra paper whilst keeping at least two metres from them?What about students who need scribes, particularly those with special educational needs. How will social distancing be maintained in this instance?12. Immuno-compromised students would need to sit the exams in total isolationThere are simply not enough invigilators or exam centres available for every student in the country with an underlying illness.13. Public health hazardsHow are we going to prevent students congregating in toilets, outside exam halls and between exams in public areas?14. The length of the papersStudents sitting in a room together breathing, coughing and sweating for a period of three hours and 20 minutes is a public health hazard no matter what social distancing guidelines are in place.15. Students living with elderly peopleWould they be required to isolate from these relatives throughout the period of the exams?16. Students with childminding dutiesStudents who have to take on childminding duties as their parents are working on the front line are disproportionately affected and this problem has only been prolonged by the two-month extension.17. Possible changes to the papers were hinted at by the minister on the radio. What on earth does that mean? Are they going to start tweaking the already prepared papers? How will this be done fairly considering every school has different parts of each course covered?18. Lack of appeals processIt has been reported that there’s likely to be no appeals process this year. With the correcting of papers already set to be rushed, losing the ability to appeal would be catastrophic for many students.19. Are students going to get any break? From the information currently available, it seems as if colleges will begin tuition soon after the CAO offers. If that’s the case, students will have studied continuously from September 2019-April 2021 without any time off.20. How will students find accommodation? The hunt for student accommodation is always difficult. Given that other students are set to return to college as normal in September, what hope do first-years have of finding places in late September, October or even November? Landlords aren’t going to hang around for then.21. How will students be able to earn money for college?Students who were relying on a summer job to pay for the cost of going to college may now not have the funds to move on to third level education.22. Payment of Leaving Cert feesMany families are going to struggle with the €116 payment which is due by April 30th with so many people currently out of work and on reduced wages. What plans are in place to ease this burden?23. What is the plan in the event a second wave of the virus comes in late summer? This doesn’t appear to have been given any consideration by the Government. Further postponement of these exams would render the 202021 college year futile.24.What lies ahead for students studying abroad? Students applying to UK or elsewhere abroad are completely in the dark and may now lose out on places as they won’t have results to present to their potential colleges on time. Similarly, international students coming to Ireland to study will be held up until these exams have been completed and the CAO process finalised.25. Who will the minister for education be in July? With government formation talks at an advanced stage, it’s highly likely there’ll be a new education minister in the coming weeks.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4228963.1586893057!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"governments across europe examining how to exit lockdown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA customer  in a  book store  after the Austrian government loosened its lockdown restrictions. Photograph: ReutersGovernments across Europe are examining how to ease out of lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus while minimising the risks of new outbreaks.Austria, France and Denmark have announced plans to gradually reopen some schools, shops and businesses, and EU health ministers are to meet in video conference on Wednesday to discuss how to co-ordinate their next steps.The European Commission is expected to announce guidelines on how to manage the exits from lockdown on Wednesday, with a “road map” of recommendations so that member states that share open borders can have consistent policies.The guidelines are expected to lay out criteria for how member states should evaluate when reopening is appropriate, and emphasise the importance of co-ordination with neighbouring countries. However, they steer clear of recommending courses of action.The launch of the document was delayed amid concerns from states that talk of ending lockdowns was premature.“It is up to member states. It is their prerogative to determine when they want to take restrictive measures and when they want to move out of restrictive measures,” a commission spokesman said.“What we have been working on over the past weeks is a road map with recommendations to ensure that when they start to move out of these restrictive measures they do so in a manner that is effective, including and in particular taking into account obviously the situation in other EU countries.”“In particular, cross-border regions need to take into account for obvious reasons the situation just across the border if they want their measures to be effective,” the spokesman added.Across Europe some political factions and businesses have been calling for lockdowns to be eased to limit the economic damage of the pandemic, and there is concern about how long citizens will endure the restrictions, especially as the weather gets warmer.Any steps towards reopening are likely to be accompanied by a range of hygiene measures, including distancing, increased cleaning and in some countries a requirement to wear face masks.Education ministers from across the EU met over video conference on Tuesday, and discussed how states were managing remote education and plans to reopen schools.Schools in Portugal and Malta are shut until at least after the summer, and in some countries until further notice. Half of EU member states are considering reopening some schools by the end of May.Croatia’s science and education minister Blazenka Divjak said: “When schools are reopening in some countries, decisions are not to open all schools but to have some schedule how to do it.“The issue is also how to guide schools and universities how to have precautionary mechanisms, and support them in building a safe environment.”FRANCEPresident Emmanuel Macron stressed that France’s reopening on May 11th is conditional on further progress against the epidemic, and that it would be gradual.The reopening of “creches, schools, colleges and lycées” is Macron’s first priority. Universities will not reopen “before summer”.Many teachers had believed that school would not resume until next September. Teachers’ unions have accused the government of sacrificing them to relaunch economic activity.Education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer stressed that “everybody will not go back at the same time”, and said priority would be given to students in disadvantaged areas.Factories that make essential items such as surgical masks and ventilators have dramatically increased production under lockdown, but most industry and the construction sector are almost at a standstill. Employers are required to respect rules on social distancing and sanitation.The government will draw up more detailed plans for reopening the economy over the next two weeks. The business management group Medef says working hours should be increased and paid holidays reduced to help the recovery.Shops selling food and drink, food delivery services, pharmacies and newspaper stands are the only retail businesses that have been allowed to remain open during the lockdown.“On May 11th we will allow most people to return to work, restart our industry, our shops and services,” Macron said.Trade unions and management are together drawing up lists of those who may reopen. Public gathering places, including restaurants, cafes, hotels, cinemas, theatres and museums, “will remain shut at this stage”, Macron said.AUSTRIAQueues formed outside Austrian garden centres and hardware stores on Tuesday as the country, one of the first to restrict public life, became one of Europe’s first to ease lockdown measures.Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said the liberalisation was possible because people had restricted their movements in recent months and adhered to the week-old obligation to wear face masks in shops and – from Tuesday – on public transport and in taxis.“This is a first step in the direction of opening that’s become possible,” said Kurz in Vienna. “We’re following our schedule, but if the numbers go into the wrong direction again we’ll use the emergency brake.”All stores with less than 400sq m floor space are open as of Tuesday, alongside hardware stores and garden centres. Face masks are still mandatory, as are access restrictions to ensure stores don’t become overcrowded and breach social distancing rules.If infection growth remains below 3 per cent per day in a week’s time, Austrian authorities say other stores and shopping centres will reopen on May 2nd and hotels and restaurants mid-May. Public events are banned until the end of June at the earliest.Construction has continued after a brief interruption, while factories never closed. Companies are struggling to survive, and state wage support costs for more than 600,000 jobs are now up to €5 billion.Schools remain closed and are unlikely to reopen before mid-May, though state “Matura” school-leaving exams will go ahead.SPAINSpain has been in a tightly controlled lockdown for a month, and the government has said it is likely to be extended at last until mid-May. However, this week non-essential workers have been allowed to return to their workplaces, a measure that affects sectors such as the building industry, manufacturing and other heavy industry.Although those sectors have broadly welcomed the lifting of the restriction, there has been some frustration at a perceived lack of clarity regarding the new circumstances. Construction companies, for example, have been told not to work or use communal areas in buildings close to residents, causing some confusion.The return to work of these Spaniards has caused an increase in the use of public transport, with the Madrid region seeing an 11 per cent rise in demand compared to last week. Police and security guards have been handing out face masks to commuters at bus and train stations.With schools still closed, the government has not yet announced how this academic year will end or be evaluated, and education minister Isabel Celaá is due to discuss the issue with regional governments this week.A group of education experts has started a campaign to persuade the government to open schools in the summer in order to help pupils study subjects in which they have fallen behind or take part in extra-curricular activities.The government’s head of health emergencies, Fernando Simón, has said he does not favour lifting restriction of movement for children yet, as some politicians have been demanding.ITALYItaly was the first EU country to go into lockdown, imposing national movement restrictions on March 9th. With the economy reeling, some politicians and businesses are calling for a return to normality, and the government has set up a task force to examine how to gradually allow daily activities to resume.Last week the government announced that the lockdown would be extended to May 3rd, but that a handful of businesses would be allowed to reopen. Bookshops, stationary shops and shops that sell children’s clothes are allowed to open from Tuesday, as long as they maintain strict hygiene rules and stagger customer entries. Some hard-hit regions in the north are to keep them closed.Schools are not expected to open until September, after the summer holidays. Under consideration for the next phase of reopening are some pillars of Italian industry, including car-making, metallurgy and fashion. Whenever it happens, businesses are likely to be required to implement hygiene precautions.Government ministers have suggested that flexible hours and working from home should be considered to prevent overcrowding of public transport.There is ision among sport authorities about when football matches can be played again, and as the weather heats up there is discussion on how to manage the annual migration of Italians out of cities to the coasts during the summer.GERMANYChancellor Angela Merkel will discuss Germany’s exit from lockdown measures on Wednesday with regional leaders. Amid growing disagreement on the approach and timetable, and with competences ided between federal and state level, the end of emergency measures is likely to be as confused and piecemeal as their beginning.Germany’s centre for disease control announced a slowing of the pandemic on Monday – 2,000 new cases in a day, down from twice that a week ago – but as yet no sign of a clear drop. More than 68,000 people have recovered from the virus, more than half of the 125,000 registered cases, and hospitals have considerable intensive bed capacity.“The measures taken are having an effect,” said Prof Lothar Wieler of the Robert Koch Institute. “The discipline we have held in the last weeks should hold a bit longer.”All schools and colleges remain closed, along with childcare, for the foreseeable future. An expert report for the government on Monday urged a “realistic” timetable to get schools open again “as soon as possible”, starting with the primary sector. Education is a competence of federal states, not Berlin, so staggered, regional solutions are likely.On Tuesday, the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, home to one in five Germans, said it was aiming to reopen kindergartens and primary schools by April 20th.A survey for the Bild tabloid found 43 per cent of parents favoured cancelling school holidays to allow children make up lost lesson time.There is no indication as to when non-essential retail and services can reopen. Again this is a competence of federal states, in agreement with inidual municipalities, so a heterogeneous pattern is likely. While construction and production has continued where site managers can guarantee social distancing, most factories are shuttered.Many large companies have closed production facilities as much due to delivery shortages and a drop in demand as the virus. Volkswagen is planning to ramp up production again on April 20th.CZECH REPUBLICThe Czech Republic closed its borders, schools, pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops in mid-March, and made it mandatory to wear a face mask in public spaces. Officials say the coronavirus outbreak is now under control, and the country registered just 68 new cases on Tuesday – the lowest daily rise since March 17th.Bicycle shops, DIY stores and craft markets reopened last Thursday, and the government is discussing whether to allow a broader range of shops to resume trading soon. However, officials are concerned by evidence of more people breaking social distancing and mask-wearing rules over the Easter weekend.The Hyundai car factory in the Czech town of Nosovice restarted limited production on Tuesday, while Skoda workers are expected to return to work on April 27th. TPCA, a Toyota-Peugeot joint venture, plans to restart on May 4th.Many construction firms have not officially halted work, but they are operating under strict social distancing guidelines. Some are reporting problems in sourcing materials and workers, including migrants after many returned home to Ukraine and elsewhere.The government initially forecast that Czech schools could reopen fully in mid-May, but given signs of widespread public opposition – including a petition that quickly garnered 80,000 signatures – such a move is now considered unlikely.Health officials say that if experts do deem it safe to reopen schools and colleges, their priority will be students in their final years who are due to sit important exams this summer.DENMARKDanish prime minister Mette Frederiksen promised to expedite easing of coronavirus restrictions thanks to infection numbers that are “better than we would have dared hope for”.On Monday, she said health authorities had noted a significant drop in hospitalisations and had given her government the green light for the country’s reopening to be “a little bit bigger”.“This will, of course, be done responsibly and carefully. The contract we ... entered together seems to have brought benefits. It also looks like it has worked.”Denmark has had nearly 6,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Of these, 2,515 people have recovered and 299 have died.Hospitals are once again taking in non-essential patients, and Danish doctors are begging patients with non-coronavirus symptoms to return.In schools all children under 12 will return to creche, kindergarten and primary school on Wednesday. Not all parents are pleased with this, and a new Facebook group – “My child will not be a Covid19 guinea pig – already boasts more than 35,000 members.Universities and secondary schools remain closed. State exams have been cancelled, and students will be awarded grade-average results.Manufacturing and construction continued largely uninterrupted during the Danish lockdown, as have factories if they could guarantee social distancing rules.Frederiksen gave no date for a reopening of retail, services and other non-essential businesses. She said just over half of these companies had continued working.On Tuesday evening she was to seek the views of all political parties on their reopening priorities, before consulting with medical experts on the next steps.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4228824.1586882767!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"boost for biden as barack obama backs presidential bid","story":"Former US President Barack Obama has formally endorsed Joe Biden urging Democrats across the party to rally behind him and form a unified front to defeat President Donald Trump and win back the White House.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Former US president Obama endorsing Joe Biden’s White House bid through a video message on Tuesday.

Photograph:  Jim BourgReutersFormer US president Barack Obama has endorsed Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, in a huge boost for Mr Biden as he seeks to become the Democratic party’s candidate to take on Donald Trump in November’s election. Mr Obama, who had not publicly commented on the Democratic nomination process or race, made the announcement in a video posted to his social media accounts on Tuesday. “I’m proud to endorse Joe Biden, ” Mr Obama said. “Choosing Joe Biden to be my vice president was one of the best decisions I ever made.He described Mr Biden as “an incredible partner when I needed him the most” and said he had “all the qualities we need in a president right now”.He added that “through all his trials” Mr Biden had never forgotten “the values or the moral fibre that his parents passed on to him”.Noting that the coronavirus pandemic had led to many examples of the “courage kindness and selflessness that we are going to need to get through one of the most difficult times in our history”, Mr Obama said this “spirit of looking out for one another... has to be reflected in our national government”.“The kind of leadership that’s guided by knowledge and experience, honesty and humility, empathy and grace. That kind of leadership doesn’t just belong in our state capitols and mayor’s offices. It belongs in the White House and that’s why I am so proud to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States, ” he said.PopularMr Obama’s endorsement is likely to be of major assistance to Mr Biden. Polls show that the former president, the first African-American to hold the office, and his wife Michelle are hugely popular with Democratic voters and the American public at large, a position that has been cemented since the election of Donald Trump in 2016. The development may also help fundraising efforts by the Biden team which is far behind Mr Trump in terms of election resources.Mr Obama’s endorsement came amid signs that he was becoming increasingly engaged in the Democratic contest in recent weeks. It is understood that Bernie Sanders spoke to the former president several times before making his decision to drop out of the race last week. Mr Obama has also been more active on Twitter of late, praising Senator Elizabeth Warren’s plan to tackle coronavirus and criticising the state of Wisconsin’s decision to hold elections last week. While not specifically mentioning Mr Trump he has also weighed in on the response to the coronavirus epidemic, noting the “racial and socioeconomic factors” that influence the spread of the virus, and calling on policymakers “to keep our most vulnerable communities at the forefront when making decisions”.Bernie SandersMr Obama’s endorsement comes a day after Mr Sanders endorsed Mr Biden for the Democratic nomination. Mr Biden and Mr Sanders, who were both contesting the Democratic nomination up to a week ago, joined forces in a live-streamed event on Monday during which Mr Sanders announced he was supporting the former vice president. “Today, I am asking all Americans. I’m asking every Democrat I’m asking every independent I’m asking a lot of Republicans – to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse, to make certain that we defeat somebody who I believe is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country,” Mr Sanders said. Mr Biden thanked Mr Sanders for being a leading voice in addressing inequality in America and “forcing us to look in the mirror and ask difficult questions”.In particular, Mr Biden is seeking to appeal to young voters who supported Mr Sanders overwhelmingly in the primary contest, helping to propel the veteran socialist to victory in several early voting states. The show of unity between Mr Sanders and Mr Biden this early in the campaign is in contrast with the Democratic contest four years ago when Hillary Clinton and Mr Sanders were locked in a bitter primary battle right up to the summer. Responding in advance to Mr Obama’s announcement, Mr Trump’s re-election campaign pointed to previous reports that the former president had discouraged Mr Biden from running in 2016. Last week Mr Trump suggested an ulterior motive for Mr Obama not having endorsed his former vice president. “It does amaze me that President Obama hasn’t supported Sleepy Joe,” Mr Trump said during the White House coronavirus task force briefing. “It just hasn’t happened. When is it going to happen? When is it going to happen? Why isn’t he? He knows something that you don’t know, that I think I know, but you don’t know. So it’ll be interesting.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4228574.1586865659!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sanders gives joe biden keys to democratic left wing with endorsement","story":"Bernie Sanders has endorsed Joe Biden’s bid for the US presidency, giving the presumptive Democratic nominee an enthusiastic backing that could help unite the party after a isive primary season.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSenator  Bernie Sanders  endorses Democratic former US vice-president Joe Biden during a live streaming broadcast on Monday night. Photograph:  JoeBiden via Getty ImagesSenator Bernie Sanders endorsed Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee for president on Monday, adding the weight of his left-wing support to Biden’s candidacy and taking a major step toward bringing unity to the party’s effort to unseat President Donald Trump in November’s US election.The decision by Sanders to back his former rival is an unmistakable signal to his supporters – who are known for their intense loyalty – that they should do so as well, at a moment when Biden still faces deep scepticism from many younger progressive voters.In a surprise joint appearance over livestreamed video, the two men revealed a rapprochement forged amid extraordinary circumstances just five days after Sanders withdrew, a sign of how profoundly the coronavirus pandemic has changed the race. The uncertainty caused by the virus, the vast damage to the US economy and the fervent desire to deprive Trump of a second term prompted an earlier-than-expected alliance between two ideological rivals, aimed at bringing together disparate factions of the party.“We need you in the White House, ” Sanders said to Biden. “And I will do all that I can to see that that happens.” Biden said: “I’m going to need you. Not just to win the campaign, but to govern.” The coalescence behind Biden will gain even more strength with the backing of senator Elizabeth Warren, who is expected to endorse him soon, according to people familiar with the matter. There is not any hold-up or demand for concessions for her support, these people said. Warren is the only major former rival yet to endorse the former vice-president, though only because she has left the timing of an announcement up to Biden’s team.The challenge now for Biden and Sanders is to create an agenda that sticks to Biden’s relatively moderate policy views and draws in progressives but also seems big enough to match the moment in the country. It is a complicated task for both of them: Biden, who easily won the Wisconsin primary in results announced on Monday evening, will have to convince more Sanders-supporting liberals that he will fight for their interests. Sanders is essentially committing himself to vouching for Biden or at least bringing more of his followers into the Biden camp. Neither man can predict with any assurance how their political alliance will pan out.Progressive scepticismAlready, progressive groups and activists were expressing scepticism about how far Biden would go to incorporate Sanders’ followers. “Winning over Senator Sanders is one thing, but Joe Biden shouldn’t think that the work is over,” said Evan Weber, political director for the Sunrise Movement, an organisation of young climate activists that had endorsed Sanders. He added, “There is still work to do to win over progressive leaders and young people.”In moving so quickly to embrace more of the policy ideas and political language of Sanders and the left, Biden is providing the clearest sign yet that the virus has changed the political equation and the rhythms of the election season. He also has indicated an intention to expand beyond his primary campaign message of restoring the nation and Washington to a pre-Trump era.Progressives have been scathingly critical of that argument, saying that it neglects the many inequities in the economic, healthcare and immigration systems and in other areas where lower-income people struggled in the Obama era and under past presidents.But at a moment of a presidential campaign when candidates often move to the centre, this expanded message could prove perilous if progressives push Biden to make policy concessions and changes that start to concern more moderate Democrats and independent voters who do not support some planks of a far-reaching liberal agenda.Clinton contrastThe alliance announced on Monday was a sharp departure from the drawn-out, often-acrimonious process of reconciliation between Sanders and Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race. And it makes good on the promise Sanders has been making for months: that he would support the eventual Democratic nominee and do everything he could to defeat Trump, whom he has called “the most dangerous president” in modern times.Former senator Christopher J Dodd, a prominent Biden supporter, said the quick co-operation was a reflection of the friendly personal relationship the two men enjoyed. Sanders was said to be greatly appreciative that Biden did not try to rush him out of the race.“A lot of people think it’s old-fashioned, being polite to people, listening to people, paying attention to them,” he said. “It’s still important to people. Personal relationships mean a lot.” Behind the scenes, Biden advisers and allies are already reaching out to former members of the Sanders campaign, according to three people familiar with the discussions, and hope to eventually bring some on board. That news of the endorsement did not leak beforehand was another signal of the growing unity between the campaigns. Only a small group of people on each campaign knew it was happening, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Warren and Biden have spoken multiple times since her exit about policy issues, including the plan that Biden has developed to respond to the pandemic. At the staff level, Warren’s chief campaign strategist, Joe Rospars, and Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Biden, have been engaged in talks bridging the two camps.Dunn, along with Ron Klain, another long-time Biden adviser, played a central role in negotiations with the Sanders camp in recent weeks, while a top Sanders political adviser, Jeff Weaver, and campaign manager Faiz Shakir represented the Vermont senator.Coronavirus effectThe scene on Monday was a striking example of the ways coronavirus has upended traditional campaigning. In normal times, both men most likely would have appeared onstage together at a rally – or at least done so at an event with more pomp. Instead, they appeared at their homes, as they have been doing for weeks.When Sanders officially declared his endorsement, Biden seemed visibly moved. “Oh!” Biden said, before dropping his head as if he hardly saw it coming. The two men said they would form “task forces” on issues including the economy, education, immigration, healthcare, criminal justice and climate change. Biden’s campaign said that the groups would include “policy experts and leaders that represent the erse viewpoints of the Democratic Party” and promised updates on the groups’ progress.Two senior Biden advisers, Cristóbal Alex and Symone D Sanders, who both have relationships in the progressive sphere, have been reaching out to leading liberal organisations, including groups that focus on immigrants’ rights and on climate. And Cedric Richmond, Biden’s campaign co-chairman, has spoken with his counterpart on the Sanders campaign, Ro Khanna, about the need to unite the party.Still, Sanders’s endorsement surprised many of the progressive grassroots groups that had endorsed his candidacy and that are struggling with the prospect of the more moderate Biden becoming the nominee. Some worried that it undercut the leverage Sanders might have to persuade Biden to make policy concessions.“We want those task forces to be given real power in the campaign and in the party apparatus,” Weber, of the Sunrise Movement, said. “Not just gestures but real commitments.” It is unclear how much sway Sanders would have over Biden’s campaign decisions, including his potential cabinet or vice-presidential selections. In a Friday interview with PBS NewsHour, Sanders acknowledged a preference for Biden to pick a more progressive running mate but said he had not weighed in on the choice.“Joe is going to have to make that decision himself,” Sanders said. ‘Friend’Throughout the campaign, Sanders had often referred to Biden as his “friend”, and the two men have a personal relationship that has remained intact. Even as the field dwindled, Sanders was reluctant to attack Biden directly and largely did so only for a brief spell near the end of his campaign that included the last debate – and only on policy.That comity was on display on Monday in an appearance that at times resembled a slapdash buddy skit, with levity that offered a brief respite from the seriousness of a national health crisis. The two men seemed to delight in talking to each other – bantering away on subjects that generally sounded as if they had been cleared with campaign aides.“Do you have any questions for me, Bernie?” Biden said. “I did, Joe,” he said. Both gushed their effusive praise.

It\u0027s a real .. and I don\u0027t mean to be offensive to the manufacturers or indeed to regular users of Arctic Roll but it\u0027s a low-level pudding.When we had it at home and we did, I was always very disgruntled by it.The Arctic Roll was first sold in Britain just over 50 years ago and quickly became a popular treat but sales slumped during the 1990s, with Birds Eye dropping the product in 1997.  It had been invented in the 1950s by Dr Ernest Velden, a Czechoslovakian lawyer who had fled the Nazis in 1939 and set up an ice cream factory the following year in Eastbourne. It later helped earn him the OBE in 1983.Following Garvey’s comments, fans of the sweet began sending pictures into Woman\u0027s Hour of Arctic Roll which she said was in its own way very nice .But by the end of the programme listeners refused to let Garvey off the hook branding her opinion as “snobby”. Garvey added: Brief mention in the apology corner to the regular purchasers and people who enjoy Arctic Roll. “I can\u0027t believe how presumptuous and snobby your presenter sounded, said one listener.To be honest with you, I don\u0027t like Arctic Roll. I didn’t like it in the seventies, I don’t like it now but I\u0027m certainly not snobby about it.     The thing was about Arctic Roll was the jam, there was hardly any jam on the sponge and what was the point of it? “I do apologise if you are a big, big fan of Arctic Roll.“Other listeners have pointed out that you can make your own. Why you would make your own I don’t know?” Signing off for the day Garvey said that on her next show she will be discussing sourdough in depth and added: “I guess that means that in a few weeks time I will be hand wrestling my very own arctic roll here in the studio for your delight.” More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"macron rallies france coronavirus mea culpa amid scepticism","story":"Emmanuel Macron has been praised for confessing that France was “insufficiently prepared” for the coronavirus outbreak but serious doubts dwell over the feasibility of his pledge to start lifting lockdown in a month’s time.Breaking ranks with other world leaders who have stonewalled suggestions they were caught short over the crisis, Mr Macron dropped warlike rhetoric for an uncharacteristic mea culpa on Monday night in a televised address watched by almost 37 million people - an all-time broadcast record.Mistakes were made. Were we prepared for this crisis? On the face of it, not enough, he said. “But we coped.”“This moment, let\u0027s be honest, has revealed cracks, shortages. Like every country in the world, we have lacked gloves, hand gel, we haven\u0027t been able to give out as many masks as we wanted to our health professionals,” he admitted.Pride in France’s widely lauded public health system took a huge knock when French doctors issued plaintive pleas for critical drugs, face masks and ventilators while neighbouring Germany has appeared to breeze through the pandemic. The medical establishment has further frayed public nerves by engaging in very public rows on potential treatments.While Mr Macron’s popularity initially shot up after he followed Italy and Spain in imposing drastic confinement, public disapproval grew amid accusations the government had failed to come clean over the shortages.Health workers in France have accused him for months of failing to respond to their demands for more equipment, better working conditions and better pay. French nurses, for example, are among the worst-paid of all OCDE countries.Last week, it transpired that the Elysée had cut a video in which the president was taken to task by medical workers while visiting a hospital in Paris. The official video showed medics applauding with Mr Macron.However, Isabelle Bernard, a nurse and CGT unionist at the Kremlin-Bicetre hospital, told Le Parisien it failed to show him being berated by a nurse who told him that they had been on strike for months and that he had never responded and that it was a pity that it took thousands of deaths for him to be concerned about healthcare.The president’s frank televised avowal over the shortcomings appeared to turn the tide, with almost two thirds of the French saying they were “convinced” by his speech even if a majority remained doubtful over how he would lift confinement.When will we be able to return to a normal life?” Mr Macron asked the nation four weeks into lockdown. “I would love to be able to answer you. But to be frank, I have to humbly tell you we don\u0027t have definitive answers, he said.Schools and shops would progressively reopen on May 11, Mr Macron said. But restaurants, hotels, cafes and cinemas would have to remain shut longer, he added. International arrivals from non-European countries would remain prohibited until further notice.Anyone presenting Covid-19 symptoms would be tested after this date and all members of the public would be given nonprofessional face masks.With 15,000 lives lost to the virus, France, like Italy and Spain, has started to see the number of patients in intensive care units decline amid hopes the epidemic has reached a plateau, although nursing homes still remain hard-hit.We\u0027ll have better days, and we\u0027ll return to happy days, Mr Macron promised.It\u0027s not every day you hear a president offer a mea culpa and dare say \u0027we have no definitive answers.\u0027 Reassuring and necessary sincerity, said analyst Maxime Sbaihi of the think tank GenerationLibre.The Republicans, France’s opposition Right-wing party, welcomed the centrist president’s “humility”, with parliamentary leader Damien Abad, noting: “The martial tone has been dropped for a more humble one. At last, he has assumed responsibility and acknowledged a certain number of mistakes.”“We welcome the objective he has clearly fixed. He has given the French a horizon for the end of confinement which was indispensable.”However, the Right and other parties questioned the method for ending lockdown, calling for mass testing on a par with Germany. “There are asymptomatic people who carry the virus,” they warned.“Every day, private businesses offer to make masks. Several initiatives have not been taken up,” complained Jordan Bardella of the far-Right National Rally, blaming “hellish bureaucratic red tape”. Socialist Olivier Faure said: “There are too many unknowns and the government must very quickly provide evidence to help understand how this can be done in time.”Teachers unions entered the fray, with Francette Popineau of the Snuipp-FSU, saying: “It’s anything but serious to re-open schools on May 11 because they tell us that public places should remain shut - cinemas, theatres - but not schools when everyone knows that these are a breeding ground for contagion.”“It appears in total contradiction with the rest.”A poll out today suggested that a majority of French, some 54 per cent, were also against Mr Macron\u0027s plan to start re-opening schools on May 11.The reasoning that keeping classes closed was worsening inequality doesn\u0027t wash compared to the health issue, said Céline Bracq of the pollster, Odoxa. Edouard Philippe, the French prime minister, sought to assuage such fears by promising a “full exit plan well before May 11”. The plan, he said, would “put in place instruments, methods, a working doctrine, the necessary coordination” for lifting lockdown. France’s employers’ federation, Medef, meanwhile hailed the prospect of a return to work and the extension of support for stricken companies and workers temporarily laid off during lockdown. However, top hospitality union, Umif, warned that restaurants, cafes and hotels were heading for economic catastrophe” amid uncertainty over when they can re-open.France\u0027s economy is now expected to contract eight per cent this year, two per cent worse than the figure flagged last week. The extension will blow the public sector budget deficit out to a post-war record of nine per cent of GDP, up from 7.6 per cent last week, budget minister Gerald Darmanin told France Info.That prompted Medef to warn that the French will have to “work harder” once confinement was lifted, prompting union complaints of “indecency”.The unions cried victory on Tuesday over a court ruling that Amazon France had failed to recognise its obligations regarding the security and health of its workers”.In what appears to be a world first, the court in Nanterre, outside Paris, ordered Amazon to limit operations to delivering only food, hygiene and medical products” while it ascertains workers\u0027 risk of coronavirus exposure.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"one nine mortgage holders given repayment holiday","story":"One in nine mortgage holders have been granted a repayment holiday, new industry figures have revealed.More than 1.2 million payment breaks have been approved since banks and building societies agreed to offer a three-month holiday to anyone who is struggling financially because of the coronavirus outbreak.The figures, published yesterday by banking trade body UK Finance, show that the number of claimants is rising by 61,000 a day as more than a million households have been left unable to pay their mortgage.However, experts warned that interest is still due on the debt amid suggestions that some homeowners appear to be claiming a break unnecessarily.Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, said lenders had “pulled out all the stops” to hand out an “unprecedented” number of payment holidays in recent weeks.He added: “We understand that the current crisis is having a significant impact on household finances for people across the country. Lenders have a number of options available to help, and payment holidays aren’t always the right solution for everyone.”Robin Fieth, of the Building Societies Association, said building societies had granted almost a quarter of a million holidays to give “much needed breathing space to families whose household income is under severe pressure during the current crisis”.There are just under 11 million outstanding mortgages, meaning roughly 11 per cent of homeowners feel they are unable to meet their monthly payments. This is expected to rise as more customers see their income fall as jobs are lost or furloughed.UK Finance estimated that the average homeowner has deferred payments of £775 a month.Customers are asked to self-certify that they cannot afford to repay their loan, and some experts feared that some have applied without understanding the long-term impact on their finances.Interest charges will still accrue during the loan repayment holiday, meaning that customers will pay more in the long run.Analysis by Private Finance, a mortgage broker, suggested this could amount to around £2,000 more over the lifetime of the loan.Mark Harris, of SPF Private Clients, another broker, said: “Not all borrowers have been affected to the same extent by coronavirus so if you are able to do so, consider maintaining your mortgage payments at the usual level or making partial payments.”He also warned that furloughed households could find it harder to remortgage or take out a new loan as their income has fluctuated.Some lenders have tightened the rules on customers with a variable income, he said, and applicants will have to prove their income has gone back to normal.UK Finance also warned borrowers that they must get agreement from their bank instead of cancelling direct debits. Failing to get permission from a lender could result in a “missed payment” being added to a customer’s credit file, damaging their creditworthiness.Concerns have been raised about the long-term impact on household finances. At present, mortgage lenders are only able to offer a three-month break to customers. Several banks have tightened their mortgage terms in recent weeks to block customers with smaller deposits from taking out a loan. However, for the 1.2 million who have been given a payment holiday it has come as a welcome relief.Sarah Lawrence, 41, and her husband Sam, 39, were approved for a three-month repayment holiday by their lender HSBC very quickly after they applied.The couple live in Surrey, with their three children, Flyn, 12, Rowan, 10, and Annie, six. Mrs Lawrence, a freelance public relations consultant, said her income has fallen by a third since the crisis began, while her husband’s has fallen by a quarter.Although an above-average earner, Mrs Lawrence said the reduction in income had meant affording their £1,600-a-month mortgage was difficult.She said she should qualify for the Government’s support package for the self-employed and is waiting to hear from HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs. However, the support will not arrive until June, leaving her and her family reassessing their finances.“My clients have been brilliant,” she said. “I had really frank conversations with them and most of them said ‘we want to carry on as we are’. But if this goes on for a significant period of time there are no guarantees.“My clients are in the property sector and the market is pretty much on hold at the moment. They aren’t really operating, so it\u0027s hard.”She said that the terms of her mortgage allow for overpayments of 10 per cent a year, so the family is keeping money aside and hopes to be able to clear the amount within months of things returning to normal.UK Finance said those looking to apply for a payment holiday should do so online as telephone lines remain extremely busy.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pressure mounts re open primary schools may half term catastrophic","story":"The government is coming under mounting pressure to re-open primary schools before the May half term, as catastrophic Office for Budget Responsibility figures forecast the economy will shrink by 35 per cent due to the coronavirus lockdown.A number of ministers are understood to be agitating for younger pupils to return to the classroom as soon as May 11 amid fears the restrictions cannot feasibly be relaxed until workers\u0027 children are back in full-time education.It had previously been suggested that at the earliest, pupils would not be back until after the Whitsun half term, which begins on May 25, the late Spring bank holiday.It comes as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), the governments’ chief scientific advisers met on Tuesday to review the lockdown. The government is expected to extend the measures for a further three weeks on Thursday, taking the possible end date to May 7. One cabinet minister told The : “We have got to make sure this economic downturn is V-shaped and not L-shaped. We should be beginning to release the things that can be released - so primary schools should re-open and so should non-essential shops. If you can go into Sainsbury’s to buy non-essential items while observing social distancing rules, why can you not do that in other shops?”Dismissing fears that parents might be fearful of term time resuming for fear of their children inadvertently spreading the virus to grandparents, they added: “It looks like elderly and vulnerable people are going to be kept in self-isolation for six months rather than three.”Sir Iain Duncan Smith, former leader of the Conservative Party, agreed, saying: “Schools are important because they enable parents to go back to work, particularly primary schools because those are the children who are too young to be left at home alone. Re-opening primary schools is the key to unlocking labour.”Working in tandem with the Treasury, Downing Street is said to be formulating plans for a gradual easing of the restrictions on a sector-by-sector basis.But one Tory source said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson had been “flip-flopping’ on the issue of re-opening schools, saying: “He’s not really a decision maker. One minute he seems to believe schools should re-open but the next he’s being overly cautious. It’s hard to work out where he stands on it from one day to the next but he is having to balance a lot of competing interests.”On Tuesday, one teachers’ union wrote to the government claiming its members are ‘disturbed’ by suggestions schools could reopen.The letter to the Prime Minister from the National Education Union read: “Given that in re-opening schools and colleges, you would be asking our members to take an increased risk, we believe they have a right to understand fully how any such proposal belongs within an overall Government strategy to defeat the virus.”When Boris Johnson announced the lockdown on March 23, prompting GCSE and A-Level exams to be cancelled, it had been suggested that schools may not re-open until after the summer holidays in September.But calls for a sooner return have been fuelled by research by University College London which found keeping pupils off has had little impact, even with other lockdown measures.Recent modelling studies of Covid-19 predict that school closures alone would prevent only two to four per cent of deaths, many fewer than other social distancing interventions. The government had expected 20 per cent of children to stay in schools after the lockdown was put in place, but actually just two per cent of vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers have carried on attending. A Number 10 insider said Mr Johnson’s gradual return to work following a week in intensive care, along with his chief adviser Dominic Cummings following his own coronavirus isolation “would have an impact on the dynamic of the lockdown”. The insider said: “Dom is worried about lifting the restrictions too early and Britain suffering a second Covid-19 wave in the autumn which could cause even greater economic damage.”However, another source pointed out that as a former advisor to Michael Gove when he was education secretary, Mr Cummings would “not have much truck with the teaching unions.”Another Tory source suggested that the government was “seriously considering” bringing in weekly reviews of the restrictions rather than the three-week assessments recommended by Public Health England (PHE). “They are going to keep this under a more regular review. You won’t see them referring to ending the lockdown but adapting it. They may extend for three weeks but that’s in name, really - you can redefine a lockdown in the middle of it.”A cabinet minister suggested that the ultimate decision would lie with Mr Johnson, who is currently convalescing at Chequers.“The Prime Minister is almost in the perfect position of being at Chequers and not at Downing Street so he can direct things and say what he wants without having to sit through boring meetings he has little patience for. He can focus on quality rather than quantity.”Insisting that Mr Johnson would continue to not only be led by the science but also the public mood, they added: “While children are still on their Easter holidays then support for the lockdown remains, but what really changes people’s minds is when their nextdoor neighbours start losing their jobs. They are seeing news of hundreds more ventilators coming in, of the Nightingale up and running and intensive care units coping. Lifting the lockdown will require an active decision by the PM but only when the public is ready for it.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scrabble app faces backlash traditionalists board game goes","story":"A new scrabble app has faced backlash from traditionalists, as former world champion Brett Smitheram says playing face-to-face “builds up resilience”. The word game, which has been beloved by players for over eighty years is being turned into an app. But with roughly half of British homes owning a set, traditionalists have hit out at the app, named Scrabble GO, calling it an “online nightmare”. Winner of the 2016 World Scrabble Championship Brett Smitheram, who has worked to promote the board game in schools across the UK, said that a generation raised on playing on apps alone would miss out on essential social learning. “Scrabble has a social element to it - if you’re losing a game of scrabble over the board you have to sit there and take it. “It builds up a bit of resilience and an ability to roll with the punches.“Whereas, if you’re just playing on a faceless app, where you don’t have to look at the other person and you can just close it down. “So there is a lack of being able to handle yourself in those ‘difficult’ situations.” He said that using apps meant players were also vulnerable to trolling, with people saying things that “they would never do face to face”.Mr Smitheram added that the “invisible nature” of using an app to play can also mean people are able to cheat.“There are a number of apps that unscramble letters and tell you all the playable words, which can impact any real benefit someone gets out of the game,” he said. Scrabble GO will replace a decade-old online version by games giant EA, which will stop working in June.While users can play a classic game, there will also be options to customise tiles and use a smaller board. Mr Smitheram said the “busy screens” can be difficult with players who have ADHD or Aspergers syndrome but developers Scopely said the app was built with a variety of players in mind.

But after the breakdown in relations with Russia in early March, it jacked up production to 11 million barrels a day.So some of those headline cuts merely offset the supply glut from the recent price war. There’s a formidable amount of black stuff in storage in ships and containers around the planet to get through.And then there’s the demand element of the equation to consider.The unprecedented lockdowns ordered by governments in response to the Covid-19 pandemic has seen global demand for energy plummet by around 30 per cent.Opec itself expected global oil demand to fall by 20 million barrels a day in April.That puts the 10 million barrels a day production cuts in the right context.As Bjornar Tonhaugen of Rystad\u0026nbspEnergy\u0026nbspputs it,\u0026nbspOpec has “only come up with half of the ransom money”.You can’t buck the market, as someone once said.Energy analysts are also doubtful about whether the production cuts will actually be delivered.Opec is not the cohesive force that it once was. The cartel has suffered from indiscipline internally. Can countries such as Iraq and Nigeria be relied on not to break ranks as their exchequers come under massive pressure in the coming months? And Opec allies are not necessarily reliable either, as the fiasco with Russia clearly demonstrates.“Trust, but verify” was the cautious view of the US towards Soviet nuclear disarmament pledges during the Cold War. Markets seem to be taking a similar attitude to production cuts now.And yet it’s possible to see something new emerging from the chaos of this price war, in particular the pressure successfully applied by Donald Trump to his Saudi allies and also Vladimir Putin’s Russia.The endorsement of the planned Opec cuts by G20 energy ministers last week and also the International Energy Agency, which was founded by industrialised countries in the 1970s to protect their fuel supplies, could also be significant.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A deal to curb supply reduces some of that danger.These are early days, of course. But international coordination on oil production could be a significant legacy of this crisis. It’s far too early to talk about global recovery when we are still on the terrifying downward slope, but more a more stable energy market could help underpin it when it eventually arrives.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, people are rightly concerned and are looking for answers and that’s simply what I was trying to impart yesterday, but for the avoidance of any doubt I want to make it clear there is no scientific evidence to substantiate any of those 5G theories. I hope that clears that up.Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, told the BBC: “The opinions of the mainstream media or the state hardly come into the debate. Numerous doctors and scientists around the world have said that the disease is caused by a virus, something completely different to a mobile phone signal.”Versions of the 5G conspiracy theory have been spreading online for years, with some proponents claiming the coronavirus outbreak is just the latest in a string of pandemics induced by electromagnetic waves.The theory has been disproved countless times by scientists, with one microbiology professor recently describing it as “both a physical and biological impossibility”.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s all I would say, as someone with an enquiring mind.”Versions of the 5G conspiracy theory have been spreading online for years, with some proponents claiming the coronavirus outbreak is just the latest in a string of pandemics induced by\u0026nbspelectromagnetic waves.Created with Sketch.High noon in a coronavirus-stricken world Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)A man holds a pocket watch at noon, at an almost empty market near the Imam Ali shrineWat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram (The Temple of the Emerald Buddha, also known as The Grand Palace)Empty streets at Old Town SquareA watch showing the time at noon, in front of Damascus GateA woman jogs past the Houses of Parliament on Westminster BridgeEmpty road with low trafficThe seafront Malecon next to an almost empty roadThe clock on Spasskaya tower showing the time at noon, next to Moscow\u0027s Kremlin, and St Basil\u0027s Cathedral on an empty squareAn empty road at RajpathThe clock strikes noon at the main concourse of the Grand Central Terminal in ManhattanAlmost empty streets at Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square)The theory has been disproved countless times by scientists, with one microbiology professor recently describing it as\u0026nbsp”both a physical and biological impossibility”.That has not stopped the baseless claims being shared by high-profile figures such as actor Woody Harrelson and TV presenter Amanda Holden.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When that ice age ended, sea levels rose and oxygen levels plummeted, resulting in a deficiency of oxygen, or anoxia.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn a new study, researchers at Stanford University found evidence that these anoxic conditions lasted for more than three million years – significantly longer than similar extinction events.“For most ocean life, it\u0026nbspwas indeed a really bad time to be alive,” said co-author Erik Sperling, an assistant professor of geological sciences at Stanford University.Created with Sketch.On the brink of extinction \u0026ampndash 25 of our closest relatives Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The study, published in Nature Communications, examined the geological record on the boundary between the Hirnantian and Rhuddanian ages in an attempt to bolster the theory.A new model was created by Richard George Stockey, a graduate student at Stanford Earth, to incorporate previously published metal isotope data as well as new data from samples of black shale\u0026nbspfrom the\u0026nbspMurzuq\u0026nbspBasin in Libya.Taking into account 31 different variables, including the amounts of uranium and molybdenum that settle on the sea floor, it concluded that severe and prolonged ocean anoxia must have occurred across large volumes of Earth’s oceans.“We can confidently say a long and profound global anoxic event is linked to the second pulse of mass extinction in the Late Ordovician,” said Mr Sperling.The researchers said the findings have relevance for today given that global climate change is contributing to declining oxygen levels in the open ocean and coastal waters.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some 1.5 million people reported not eating for a whole day during the first three weeks of\u0026nbsplockdown, according to a\u0026nbspYouGov\u0026nbsppoll for The Food Foundation.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign has been supporting\u0026nbspwork going on across the country to ensure that everyone has enough to eat during the outbreak and is backed by figures such as London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan, Labour MP\u0026nbspJess Phillips\u0026nbspand TV cook\u0026nbspNigella Lawson.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile several food banks have told us they have been forced to close their doors, many of them are attempting to switch gears and move into the home delivery of emergency food packages.Bassetlaw Food Bank in Nottinghamshire was forced to “temporarily suspend” normal\u0026nbspoperations at the beginning of April, after it lost more than two-thirds of its mainly older volunteers who are having to self-isolate or follow NHS shielding guidance.How to support our campaignAdministrator Mark\u0026nbspBagguley\u0026nbspis part of a skeleton team now working with\u0026nbspBassetlaw\u0026nbspCouncil Voluntary Service (BCVS) to make sure the most vulnerable people in the area get food parcels dropped at their door.“You just have to find a different way of doing things,” he said. “We’re trying to work others as best we can. It’s very difficult to say whether the local need is being met, now that everything has been thrown on its head. You just have to help as many people as you can.”Despite food donations left in supermarket collection points “dwindling significantly”, Mr Bagguley is making sure the produce gets taken to the BCVS’s central hub, where drivers deliver to people struggling with job losses, cuts in income or difficultly getting outside for health reasons.The Welcome Centre, an independent food bank in Huddersfield, has lost 50 per cent of its volunteers since the\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspbegan. Yet demand for help has roughly doubled in the past few weeks.\u0026nbspKirklees\u0026nbspCouncil has sent two members of full-time staff to help the charity carry on by making home deliveries across the West Yorkshire town.“We normally help about 300 people in a month,” said Emma Greenough, one of The Welcome Centre’s managers. “It’s likely we’re helping around 600 people at the moment – although it’s guesswork at the moment because things are changing so fast.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If the government could suspend the five-week wait for universal credit, it would be a big help to people.”Both the Trussell Trust, Britain’s largest network of food banks, and the Independent Food Aid\u0026nbspNetwork (IFAN) are calling on the Department for Work and Pension to end the five week-wait on new claimants receiving their first universal credit payment.Ms\u0026nbspGoodwin said some of the independent food banks that closed a few weeks ago have already been able to re-emerge in a different form. “At the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak at least 12 of our member organisations closed. Since then, three of them have reopened because they have been able to adapt and put new processes in place.”The DENS Food Bank in Hemel Hempstead, part of the Trussell Trust network, is relying on extra help so it can continue to operate. Demand for food parcels has gone up 75 per cent in the past few weeks, at a time the food bank is struggling with a drop in volunteers. It has forged an alliance\u0026nbspwith another local charity called the South Hill Centre, allowing volunteer drivers to make home deliveries to people asking for help.“A lot of people have seen their income drop and they don’t have savings to cover them,” said Wendy Lewington, DENS Food Bank’s CEO. “For the self-employed, the government help that might be there in a couple of months isn’t there immediately so they’re struggling to afford the basics.”Both the Welcome Centre and DENS Decorum Food Bank are looking for financial donations and non-perishable items such as UHT milk, soups, tinned meat and fish – proving harder for many food banks to buy in bulk at the supermarkets.Despite the difficulties faced by small, local food banks, some of the larger food surplus charities – rescuing\u0026nbspunwanted or short-dated stock from restaurants, retailers and\u0026nbspmanufacturers\u0026nbsp– are stepping up to fill\u0026nbspsome of the gaps.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is supporting the work of our key partner The Felix Project – which has teamed with two other large organisations\u0026nbspin London to forge the London Food Alliance.The London Food Alliance is now coordinating with all 32 London boroughs to make sure the new, council-run community hubs are well-stocked with supplies, and also providing meals for\u0026nbspNHS staff.The Independent\u0026nbspis also encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

And there are those who choose to continue to attack us without presenting any evidence.Hostility with China is not going to help solve the coronavirus crisisTory rebels are right – Huawei is a threat to our national securityJohnson suffers revolt in Tory vote to end Huawei 5G involvement“Disrupting our involvement in the 5G rollout would do Britain a disservice.”Last month, the government hinted at future concessions to opponents of Huawei’s involvement in rolling out the ultrafast wireless technology when a minister said 36 Tory MPs who refused to vote in line with the leadership had been heard “loud and clear”.The rebels fear Huawei is effectively a front for the Chinese state – putting the UK’s security at risk – and want it ripped out of the 5G network by the end of 2022.But in his letter, Mr Zhang highlighted Huawei’s already extensive role in Britain’s data network, and said the firm was “focused on keeping Britain connected” during the “unprecedented” coronavirus pandemic.Created with Sketch.Inside Huawei\u0027s new campus for workers in China Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanAn employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA worker cleans a waterway as office buildings are seen at Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn Research and Development campus in Dongguan, near shenzenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicThe real Cesky Krumlov in Czech RepublicEmployees sleep in their cubicle in the research and development area after lunch at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus modelled after Heidelberg in GermanyEmployees play basketball on a court within the  staff housing complex at the end of the workday at the Bantian campus in ShenzhenA replica of the Karl Theodor Bridge in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusThe real Karl Theodor Bridge in Heidelberg, GermanyHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanEmployees ride the bus home at the end of the workday from the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenHuawei workers eat their subsidised lunch in one of many large cafeterias at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenReception staff walk in front of a large screen showcasing different technologies in the foyer of a building used for high profile customer visits at the campus in ShenzenAn employee reads in the staff library on a break at the company\u0027s Bantian campus in ShenzhenAn area of Huawei\u0027s new Ox Horn campus modelled after a European CityServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanHe said data usage had increased by at least 50 per cent since Covid-19 first reached the UK, placing “significant pressure” on telecoms systems.“That’s why reliable mobile and broadband networks are crucial.

I’m usually a very calm person, but this has pretty much broken me.“I’m being told to take myself\u0026nbspthrough an airport and get on a plane during this pandemic,\u0026nbspand go somewhere in the States. Where do I stay? There are people still homeless on the streets who can’t find somewhere to go. Who’s going to rent at this time? Am I supposed to live at the garage at my sister’s house? It’s mind-boggling.”How to be productive if you have to work from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsShould you be taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat coronavirus?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?The UK government’s guidance currently advises against all but essential travel to the US, and states that those who are able to enter the country from the UK by air would be asked to self-isolate for 14 days.Hours after The Independent contacted the Home Office on Monday, a\u0026nbspBorder Force\u0026nbspagent called Ms Collins to tell her the date by which she must leave the UK had been pushed back to mid-May. However, she remains fearful of being forcibly separated from her Scottish partner Alan Gibb.The 60-year-old moved to the UK to live in Aberdeen with Mr Gibb\u0026nbspin 2013 after the pair met the previous year while he was working at the same venue as her in Houston. She applied for, and was granted, leave to remain in the UK on a partner visa for a five-year period in January 2016, after paying more than £1,700 for the application.A problem emerged when Ms Collins visited the US for 11 weeks in 2018 to care for her younger sister, who had been diagnosed with blood cancer, during which she inadvertently missed the renewal date for her\u0026nbspvisa.She said she had been told she could still renew it on her return to the UK, but on arriving at Heathrow Airport she was detained for five hours and had a visit visa stamped in her passport, which in effect cancelled her previous partner visa.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Collins and Mr Gibb have since been fighting to appeal the decision.Mr Gibb, who is now retired but formally worked in the oil and gas industry, said: “I’m gobsmacked. It’s incredulous, the whole thing. It’s a\u0026nbspcompletely nonsensical situation\u0026nbspfrom start to finish.\u0026nbspI cannot comprehend it, especially under the current circumstances.Katie has nowhere to go. It’s bad enough deporting anyone any time –\u0026nbspunless they’ve committed a heinous crime of course –\u0026nbspbut under the current circumstances it beggars belief. It shows how much is wrong with this system. We’re dumbfounded.”Stephen Flynn, the couple\u0027s local MP, said:\u0026nbsp“You have to seriously question the motivation behind this UK government when it appears willing to deport iniduals during the middle of a global pandemic.“I’ve been in direct contact with Katie and the Home Office and will continue to try and press for this deportation threat to be dropped and for a full review of her case to be undertaken –\u0026nbspit’s only fair that this happens.”Caroline Coombs, co-founder of Reunite Families UK, a charity which has been supporting Ms Collins, said: “Serving a deportation order on Easter Monday is quite frankly unbelievable. We know officials are working every hour God sends at this time, but ministers will surely want their officials to look again at this case.“Deporting an innocent 60-year-old woman who has a family in the UK\u0026nbspduring a global pandemic makes no sense. \u0026nbspEspecially when the last immigration minister admitted the department had made mistakes. Everybody’s time would be better spent if the home office halted this action and not break Kate and Alan’s hearts over a technicality.A Home Office spokesperson said they did not routinely comment on inidual cases, adding:\u0026nbsp“We have been clear that iniduals lawfully in the UK will not be penalised for circumstances beyond their control, which is why we are extending their leave until 31 May 2020.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

No of course not.”But he added: “While the economic impacts are significant, the OBR also expect them to be temporary, with a bounce back in growth.“The OBR today have been clear that if we had not taken the actions we have, the situation would be much worse. In other words, our plan is the right plan.”The chancellor played down suggestions of a growing rift in the cabinet between ministers who want to extend tight social distancing guidelines and others who want them lifted to revive the economy.“Right now, the single most important thing we can do for the health of our economy is to protect the health of our people,” he said.“It is not a case of choosing between the economy and public health.“Common sense tells us that doing so would be self-defeating.“At a time when we are seeing hundreds of people dying every day from this terrible disease, the absolute priority must be to focus all of our resources – not just of the state but of businesses and all of you at home as well – in a collective national effort to beat this virus.”Mr Sunak rejected suggestions that the UK would be feeling the financial cost of coronavirus for a generation to come, insisting that measures such as the government’s “furlough” scheme would allow the UK to “bounce back as quickly as possible”.“This is going to be hard, our economy is going to take a significant hit and people are going to feel that in their jobs and in their household incomes,” he said.But he added: “What I would say and what the OBR report confirms is that the measures we’ve put in place can significantly mitigate that impact.”Liberal Democrat acting leader Ed Davey said too many people had been “left out” of Mr Sunak’s plans, including those who changed jobs in the weeks before the lockdown, many self-employed people and businesses which had found themselves unable to secure the loans he has announced.“Our economy is falling off a cliff, but it seems the chancellor has no more help to offer,” said Davey.“Facing the possibility of an economic downturn of historic proportions, the chancellor needed to be absolutely clear about planning for additional interventions to protect jobs and livelihoods as the crisis evolves. Instead the chancellor fell back on rhetoric about having the ‘right’ plan.”Office for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The sign that adorned the entrance of the market, a landmark of Wuhan city, has also been removed.As residents prepare for a return to work this week, business owners at the market will have nowhere to go. “Since all businesses need to apply for permission from the government before they restart operation, it will be impossible for these businesses to gain the government’s approval,” said Michael, who used to own a fruit stand a few blocks away from the Huanan Seafood Market and refused to give his real name.Wildlife trade was once a lucrative and thriving industry in China, but the suspicion that the current coronavirus pandemic started in\u0026nbspexotic animals smuggled into the country has forced the government to crack down on the decades-old trade.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast month, Beijing rolled out a strict ban on the breeding and consumption of wild animals, as it tried to prevent another outbreak from happening. This was a general guidance issued from the central government, with the power to enforce the law ultimately lying with provincial or municipal officials.Several other provinces have followed suit, and the southern industrial hub Shenzhen announced a ban on the sale and consumption of dog and cat meat on Thursday, becoming the first Chinese city to do so.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastIn Wuhan, local officials have been increasingly strict in their crackdown on businesses engaged in wildlife trade or breeding. On 3 March, local authorities in Wuhan carried out a comprehensive disinfection campaign across the entire Huanan Seafood Market.However, recent reports suggest that despite the regional governments\u0027\u0026nbspefforts to put an end to wildlife trade, illicit commercial activities are still happening at public markets in certain parts of China. Earlier this week, the Mail on Sunday reported that thousands of customers flooded an indoor market in the southwestern city of Guilin in China, as living dogs and cats were crammed into cages while dead bats and scorpions were on display.Andrew Huang, a Chinese culinary expert, says one of the reasons why it’s hard for the Chinese government to completely end the consumption and trading of wildlife in China is because such behaviours have become part of decades-olds tradition in the country.“Different parts of China have their specific traditions of consuming wildlife for different purposes,” Mr Huang explains. “In the northeastern part of China, bears and deers are a big part of the local delicacies while in southwestern China, bats and pangolins are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. The steady demand for such wildlife has nurtured a lucrative supply chain, including some businesses that focus on breeding specific types of wild animals.”Mr Huang thinks that the current crackdown on wildlife trade and consumption might temporarily prevent relevant practices from happening in public markets, but it will be hard to completely eliminate it from the Chinese culture.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“In the short term, even if wildlife sellers can’t keep selling these animals in public, they will try to find other ways to keep the businesses alive,” Mr Huang tells The Independent. “As the old saying goes, life will always find a way. Even if the government has banned wildlife trade and consumption, the tradition won’t be so easily wiped out.”‘No need to close the entire market’In Wuhan, while the plan to shut down the Huanan Seafood Market is underway, local residents have different opinions about how to handle the market where the coronavirus pandemic began.“Honestly, wildlife trade isn’t the main commercial activity at the Hunan Seafood Market, as most of the sellers still focus on selling different kinds of seafood,” says Ms Xu, who was a frequent shopper at the market until it was shut down.Since the market is right next to one of the major train stations in the city, she says, it has become the regional hub for selling fruits and seafood, as well as wildlife. Due to the large number of visitors coming from different parts of Hubei province, it also became the ideal breeding ground for the coronavirus.“I think even if the government wants to ban wildlife trade, they don’t have to shut down the entire seafood market,” Ms Xu says. “This will have a huge impact on local restaurants and businesses that have long relied on the market for their seafood supplies.”Ms Xu says that instead of forcing dozens of business owners to lose their livelihoods, the Chinese government should focus more on tackling the ongoing pandemic itself. “I wish the government could conduct more coronavirus tests on citizens, because I suspect many of them could still be asymptomatic patients or patients with mild symptoms,” she said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Denise Hruby reports from ViennaOn the streets of Mariahilfer Strasse, a shopping boulevard in the centre of Vienna, only a small number of people donning face masks stroll past stores.Shops began reopening across Austria on Tuesday\u0026nbspafter the country started to loosen restrictions after a month of lockdown, but most people seemed to decide to stay at home.A sign outside the Vienna Candy Store signals\u0026nbspto passers-by that the small business is open, but inside, owner Adnan Sulejmani remains by himself.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“People are still afraid, just look outside,” Sulejmani tells The Independent.Sulejmani stares out on to an almost deserted Mariahilfer Strasse, a strip that usually bustles with shoppers, tourists and office workers, where he opened his store just three months ago.“It’s awful, really. It’s just a horrible situation,” he says, standing amid\u0026nbspbaskets filled with candied apples and gummy bears.“We’ve only opened in mid-December, and things were going really well.”Denmark reopens schools and shops, sparking concerns from parentsFor now, only shops smaller than 400 square\u0026nbspmetres\u0026nbspare allowed to reopen, and rules of wearing a mask and keeping a minimum distance of 1.5 meters are being enforced.Home-improvement stores, which also reopened, did however see a run on construction materials and gardening supplies.Austria’s lockdown of all businesses considered nonessential went into effect on 16 March\u0026nbspand, one month later, the country is among the first\u0026nbspin Europe to start lifting restrictions. Denmark also opened schools and shops on Tuesday, and a day earlier Spain allowed those in industry and construction to return to work.While the move in Austria offered hope for a return to some sort of normality, experts cautioned that it risks seeing the number of infections rise again and, at worst, leading to a renewed nationwide shutdown.Like countless others, the lockdown has put Sulejmani’s business and his own financial future in\u0026nbsplimbo. The young business owner sacked three employees and dramatically reduced the hours of two others.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Larger stores and malls are set to reopen in May.“We can’t ignore the economic and social ramifications, and from that point of view there’s no way around opening the economy again,”\u0026nbspClemens Martin Auer, a special envoy\u0026nbspat the ministry of health and one of the government’s top advisers during the pandemic, tells The Independent.“And from an epidemiological point of view, it’s justifiable,” Auer adds, pointing to the government’s success in flattening the curve.The figure of new infections continues to recede each day, but overall infections are now doubling every two weeks – a sharp decline compared with mid-March, when the figure doubled every three days.What the UK can learn from South Korea’s success with coronavirusNew Zealand’s unique approach to coronavirus is working rapidlyHow Germany became Europe’s first country to flatten the curveHow Greece managed to flatten the curveSo far 384 people have died in Austria from coronavirus and more than 14,000 have been infected. By comparison, more than 12,000 people in the UK have died and more than\u0026nbsp90,000\u0026nbsphave been infected.For this new phase of loosened restrictions, Auer and other officials have cautioned that progress could be jeopardised if people do not stick to a set of new guidelines, most notably wearing masks that cover the mouth and nose and keeping a distance of at least 1.5 meters to other customers, or waiting outside if shops\u0026nbspappear too busy.If that doesn’t suffice and the rate of infections increases again, a\u0026nbsprenewed lockdown is possible. “That’s an option, but we’re trying to avoid that by focusing on the elderly and other at-risk groups and trying to contain clusters as early as possible,” Auer continues.Some experts have criticised the lack of planning for the next phase in Austria’s Covid-19 response.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus Podcast“It’s immensely dangerous,” independent health economist Ernest Pichlbauer tells The Independent,\u0026nbspadding\u0026nbspthat the government lacks\u0026nbspepidemiologists who could\u0026nbsphelp guide it through this next phase of opening up the economy.“The government is doing this because it’s the public’s wish to reopen the economy, but it seems that they are doing this in blind flight.”Businesses are\u0026nbspalso unsure how it will work out, and what to expect from the coming weeks. Many have decided to remain shuttered for now, aware that customers are still staying at home or because they face disrupted supply chains. But for independent business owners like Sulejmani, staying closed for another day wasn’t an option.“I felt that I didn‘t have a choice,” he says. “I still don’t know if I have to pay rent this month, or what type of support I’ll get from the government – but whether we’ll make any money now? I don‘t know. But I have hope. We all do,” he says.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Using a technique known as credential stuffing, hackers are able to link login details that are used for more than one online account in order to compromise another.​Cyber security experts responded to the dark web listings by reiterating the common-sense security practice of not using the same password across multiple websites and apps.“Hackers use very simple tools to re-use passwords that are stolen in separate data breaches – an attack known as ‘password stuffing’. They are then able to quickly attempt to access all accounts with the same email address as the user name,”\u0026nbspsaid Jake Moore, a security specialist at antivirus firm ESET.“Zoom users must never use the same password anywhere else, but it is especially crucial that the same password is not used for their email account too, or the attacker would be able to send invites from the victim, making the attack even more dangerous.”Despite Zoom not being directly implicated, the discovery once again raises security concerns about the video chat app, which has seen a huge surge in popularity in recent weeks as a result of coronavirus containment measures forcing people to work from home.The company has been criticised for the way it handles users’ personal information, as well as a phenomenon known as “Zoombombing”, whereby strangers join meetings and disrupt conversations with offensive language and behaviour.It has prompted some organisations and businesses to ban its use and prompted the FBI to issue a warning last month\u0026nbspabout making Zoom meetings public.Zoom recently hired a former Facebook security chief Alex Stamos as an adviser\u0026nbspand released new updates in an effort to address these issues.“It is common for web services that serve consumers to be targeted by this type os activity, which typically involves bad actors testing large numbers of already compromised credentials from other platforms to see if users have reused them elsewhere,\u0026nbspA Zoom spokesperson told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“We have already hired multiple intelligence firms to find these password dumps and the tools used to create them, as well as a firm that has shut down thousands of websites attempting to trick users into downloading malware or giving up their credentials.“We continue to investigate, are locking accounts we have found to be compromised, asking users to change their passwords to something more secure, and are looking at implementing additional technology solutions to bolster our efforts.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And the bus drivers — nine already dead in London alone from Covid-. And the pharmacists filling out prescriptions in tiny, windowless shops.And the postmen, delivery drivers, papergirls — and anonymous neighbours who put notes through doors offering help for the vulnerable.And the supermarket workers who stack the shelves to keep our nation fed. And a round of applause for our Queen,  this month, who gave the speech of a letime last Sunday — and for our Prime Minister who ended up in intensive care.From the bin men to Boris, we are surrounded by heroes — but the one glaring exception has been elite football.Despite inidual acts of heroism, such as Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford raising £million for underprivileged schoolkids, football has not covered itself in glory during this national emergency.On Wednesday, Premier League captains announced they were banding together to create a fund to raise millions for the NHS.This is a big-hearted gesture but can’t hide the fact that for much of this health crisis the national game has been hopelessly out of touch with the national mood.When the Prime Minister was seriously ill, it made the skin crawl to see whining millionaire footballers resisting pay cuts from clubs that have nothing to sell, no revenue coming in and no idea when football will begin again.Gordon Taylor, the £million-a-year chief of the Professional Footballers Association, has made his members about as popular as bankers.While the country fights for its le, Taylor has fought for the rights of loafing footballers to keep every last million. He has badly misjudged the moment, as have the clubs owned by billionaires who have furloughed their tea ladies while pampered footballers continue to earn up to £, a week.It has been embarrassing to see hypocritical footballers mistaking “lockdown” for “lock-in”, acting like the new rules do not apply to them.After previously urging fans to stay at home, Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish emerged bleary-eyed from an all-night party and pranged his -grand Range Rover.Manchester City’s Kyle Walker had a couple of escort girls delivered to his door, soon before telling the peasants to social distance and save lives and blah-blah-blah. All that stuff about washing your hands, Kyle — should that be before or after the escorts have been round And Spurs manager Jose Mourinho oversaw a training session on Hadley Common, for all the world asthere was one rule for the princes of football and one for the plebs who pay their wages.Do the fatheads of football ever watch the news Mass unemployment is coming. Many of the millions about to be chucked on the dole will be football fans. So how the hell can football — the players, clubs, PFA — continue to kid themselves the bubble they exist in has not already burst The world has changed.There should be no more all-night parties, no more escort girls and no more car prangs. Like it or not, footballers are role models and many will follow their lead.Troy Deeney, Watford captain and one of the prime movers behind the Players Together fund, defends Jack Grealish’s busy social le during the time of lockdown. “What’s he going to do ” Troy asked. “Sit in the yard on his own ”Yes, Troy — because that’s what millions are doing right now. Shocking, I know, but the new rules apply to footballers, too.Most footballers come from working-class backgrounds but too many of them have a sense of entitlement worthy of Marie Antoinette.Look what happened to her.NEVER going out is placing an unbearable strain on relationships.So it is nice to see that Camila Morrone, , and Leonardo DiCaprio, , seem to be happily self-isolating together.I was afraid Leo might decide Camila’s just too old for him.STEVE HEDLEY, rail union fat cat at the RMT, boasts that he would “throw a party”Boris Johnson died of coronavirus – and hopes “the whole Cabinet of Tory b******s” also become victims.If Hedley was on a ventilator fighting for his le, would he check how the doctors and nurses caring for him voted at the last election You don’t think those NHS heroes all voted Labour, do you, Steve WILLIAM and Kate carried out their first virtual royal duty this week, thanking teaching staff who look after the children of key workers.I have never seen smiles that wide on the faces of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.I am sure that, deep down inside, they are really missing Harry and Meghan.They are just covering it up really well.FAREWELL Honor Blackman, who has died at the age of , immortal for ever in her career-defining role as Pussy Galore in Goldfinger.It is funny how certain names fall out of favour.At school I had mates called Keith and Ian, but nobody is called Keith or Ian today.Same thing with Pussy Galore. Bond girls just don’t get called things like Pussy Galore any more.THIS lockdown is taking an enormous toll on jobs, education and mental health but most of us understand it is necessary.I am infuriated, though, by the constant threats to intensy the lockdown, including closing the parks,a handful of idiots continue to flout the rules.Health Secretary Matt Hancock rages that he finds it “unbelievable that people are not staying at home” – and threatens to ban all exercise.Personally, I find it unbelievable that Hancock makes threats like some little home counties Hitler.Give credit to the MILLIONS who are doing their best during the lockdown.Don’t threaten the decent majority with a punishment beating because a selfish minority break the rules.If this Government ramps up the lockdown they will lose the British people. And something will explode.If some morons can’t stick to the rules, punish THEM – not the rest of us.KILLING EVE lost its way when the show’s creator Phoebe “Fleabag” Waller-Bridge bailed out after the first series. The second series was painfully naff.Early reports on the third series, starting tomorrow on BBC iPlayer, are not promising.But Jodie Comer as Russian assassin Villanelle will always make you want to tune in. Evenit is just for her new outfits.THIS global catastrophe started in China.When the dead are buried and we stand among our ruined economies, there MUST be some kind of reckoning.After World War Two, the Potsdam Conference decided that Germany should pay billion for what Germany had inflicted on humanity.China is now boasting that le is back to normal there, while we are burying NHS nurses like Rebecca Mack, , who worked in a children’s cancer unit. She has been hailed as a “wonderful daughter” by her heartbroken parents.Coronavirus was not an act of God. It started in China.A study by  senior Tories concludes that the UK should pursue China through international courts for £billion in coronavirus compensation.Germany paid for starting the war. Why shouldn’t China pay for coronavirus GREAT news that Boris is out of intensive care and on the way to recovery.But when he emerges from that ICU, he must give himself all the time it takes to fully recover.And then Boris has to lose weight. I saw David Cameron describe Boris as “very fit”.Sorry – a -year-old man who weighs over st is emphatically not “very fit”.He is a serious illness – a heart attack, stroke or diabetes – waiting to happen.I know from having Boris as my neighbour for years that he loves his jogging and cycling. But please slim down, Boris.Carrie and your unborn child need you. So does Dilyn the dog. So does your country.Because Boris Johnson’s great genius is for giving people HOPE.God knows we need some of that right now. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a magnicent address, from a magnicent woman.Her experience and serenity did more to calm and inspire the nation than anything  I can think of as this crisis has unfolded.Best of all, she reminded us that there will be le beyond this lockdown — that we will meet again.If we just focus on the here and now, we won’t be able to prepare for the future beyond the virus.But it’s also true that none of us can think straight when we are in the eye of the storm.That is where good leadership comes in. It helps us all to hold strong, not to go to pieces and to stick to the guidance given to us.Everyone looks to the leader to make decisions, and it’s the decisions we make that will chart our way out of the crisis.Unfortunately, after the Queen’s address to the nation came the news that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been admitted to hospital intensive care.At that point, anyone who was in any doubt this illness did not discriminate was forced to reconsider.At the time of writing, Boris was back on a regular hospital ward. But his illness has been a reminder that any of us are susceptible to Covid-.Most people are shocked he is in hospital and sympathise with his pregnant girlfriend Carrie Symonds.But of course it has raised the question: Who is really in chargehe is not  Without leadership, we all get distinctly uneasy.We all have leaders in our lives. We are all looking towards them to show us what to do and lead us through it.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealSome companies have stepped up to the plate and are doing good things — reassuring their staff, treating people well and doing their utmost to make sure people will be paid. Some aren’t, of course. But good bosses are taking pay cuts and doing everything they can to keep their businesses alive and look after their staff.At West Ham United we continue to pay all our full and part-time staff  per cent of their wages.My financial director, my manager and I have all taken a  per cent reduction to make sure this happens.It’s when there’s a crisis like this that we see who is made of what.Boris’s temporary stand-in, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, while talking about the PM’s hospital admission, referred to him as his boss, his colleague, but also his friend.Respect and friendship are the key words when it comes to good leadership.A good leader makes the tough decisions because they are right, but they are also governed by ethics. They want to do the right thing, for the right reasons. They are happy to make personal sacrices to ensure the majority are looked after.It is more important now, than ever, to put people before profits.After three weeks of lockdown, with no chance of a let-up, it’s all too easy to fall prey to catastrophic, even apocalyptic thinking.But we have to sht our thought process. We have to accept and understand that, at some point, this WILL be over.When things are calmer and clearer, we can ask what we can do to ensure we are still operating as the world gets back to normal — whatever the new normal is.The experience we are all living through really is like a storm, which continues to rage.There are so many unprecedented aspects to this situation and there is not one person in the world who will come out of it unchanged.So while there are so many challenging and dficult things going on, perhaps this lockdown is a chance for us all to learn more about ourselves.How are you responding  Have you thought about how you can help others  Have you thought about volunteering for the NHS As well as the importance of good leadership, we all have our inidual roles when it comes to showing autonomy and courage about our own decisions.I’m sorry to say, things are going to get a lot worse before they get better.So we all need to take responsibility — or we will never get out of lockdown.ANYONE who saw the social media video of Naomi Watts reaching breaking point after her printer, vacuum cleaner and dishwasher all broke down will surely have smiled in recognition.Naomi, who has been self-isolating in her Los Angeles home for three weeks, shared her very understandable anguish with a slow-motion video of herself screaming with the sound of a lion’s roar played in the background.I think we can all relate to her frustration.My lockdown revelation I am happy to report that I have given up ironing!WHEN it comes to illness, particularly cancer, I’ve long resisted all the talk of going into battle – mainly because of the unhelpful implication of weakness among those who “lose” that fight by dying.I feel the same way about descriptions of people “fighting” coronavirus.Illness is a fact of le. It is not a sign of weakness.The sad and terrible truth is that some people get this virus and others do not.Some have it very badly – a whole lot worse than others.We don’t yet know exactly why. We don’t even knowwe have the virus and may infect people.We don’t knowthere are antibodies that can protect us from getting it again, or how long that will take.We don’t knowthere will be a more deadly mutation of the same virus in the future.There is just too much we don’t know.But there are some practical things we can do.We need to help those who have it now, and the NHS and the Government are doing all they can in this regard.We also need to stop the spread of the virus, through testing. Hopefully that is going to happen soon.Meanwhile, scientists are also working around the clock to create a vaccine.Perhaps, most of all, we need to prepare for the possibility that this could all happen again.We need to learn lessons on food distribution, working from home, adapting our businesses – and having proper personal protection and hospital equipment ready and waiting.AS time ticks on, we are all realising what le is like without the things we used to consider necessities.Like our hairdressers.Claudia Winkleman’s Instagram post showing how unmanageable her fringe has become during lockdown made me laugh in recognition.My hair is grey, long and unkempt.On the one hand, it’s the least of my worries, which is quite liberating.Still, I did manage to get my hands on some hair dye for the roots.Do I care that it’s completely the wrong shade NO. I do not.So please, can we all just agree to turn a blind eye to the way we look when we finally emerge from lockdown HAPPY Easter Sunday, people. How will you be spending yours Personally, I have lost track of what day it is. The past few weeks have been a blur, with every day feeling like a cross between Sunday and Monday.It was my birthday last week and, without loved ones to hug, friends to see, drinks to be had, it was more or less just another day.Equally, this is the first time ever that Easter has felt like just another weekend.But I hope you can find ways to make it special. Just make sure you do so at home.THERE has been talk of schools possibly reopening after the Easter holidays – and who knows whether or not that is true But one thing I do know is that, whenever they do reopen, working parents will not only give the most massive sigh of relief, they will all be thanking their children’s teachers profusely for everything that they do.We will all also be thanking doctors, nurses, all NHS employees, as well as bin men, cleaners, shop assistants and all the other key workers we have under-paid and taken for granted.I really hope that is one thing which changes as a result of this pandemic.These people are the backbone of our country.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One says that restrictions should be lted sooner rather than later to reboot our ecomony, while the other argues that the restrictions are working, so now is not the right time to lt them.When Chancellor Rishi Sunak first announced his bail-out plan last month, it was estimated that ten to  per cent of workers in the ­private sector would need Government support.Now economic forecasters believe it could be a third of the total private sector workforce. That will cost the British taxpayer between £billion and £billion every three months.To date, about a fth of small businesses have been pushed into bankruptcy. If the lockdown continues to July, that figure will rise to a third.The effect of this on the economy will be catastrophic. According to the ­Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, Britain’s GDP could contract by  per cent over the next two years. It shrank by six per cent during the global financial crisis of -.The Centre for Economics and Business Researchsays the lockdown is costing £.billion a day.Given we are now  days into the lockdown, this means we are already more than £billlion out of pocket.In short,we don’t ease off on the social distancing measures and re-boot the economy, we’re heading for the biggest economic downturn since the s.Against this, we are told thatwe end the lockdown more people will become infected, demand for critical hospital care will outstrip the NHS’s capacity and we’ll begin to see people dying in even greater numbers.I’m sceptical about that prognosis.It is based on the statistical modelling of Professor Neil Ferguson and his team at Imperial College, but there is mounting evidence that they under-estimated the percentage of the population already infected with coronavirus and over-estimated how deadly this disease is.According to Prof Ferguson’s model, fewer than five per cent of people have been infected. But according to another model, this one produced by Oxford University, it could be higher than  per cent, which would mean we are on our way to acquiring herd immunity.When Chris Whitty, England’s Chief Medical Officer, was asked at Thursday’s press conference what percentage of the world’s population has been infected, he put the figure at  per cent.If the true figure is between  and  per cent, the NHS can probably copewe ease off on some of the more extreme social distancing measures.Would ending the lockdown be ­gambling with people’s lives  Yes, but so will keeping it in place.Economic downturns cost lives, just as surely as viruses. During the global financial crisis of –, the suicide rate in Europe increased by . per cent. Economic recessions also cause a rise in poverty, domestic ­violence and murder.Philip Thomas, professor of risk ­management at Bristol University, has calculated thatour GDP falls by more than . per cent as a result of the lockdown, more years of le will be lost than saved.Politicians here and where have justied their cautious approach by ­saying they refuse to put a price on human le, as though the trade-off is between the lives of vulnerable people and economic growth.But the real trade-off is between the lives we might losewe end the ­lockdown tomorrow and the lives we know we will losewe keep it in place indefinitely.MPs aren’t being morally ­courageous. Rather, they’re just focusing on the next -hour news cycle, as they always do.What’s needed is a bold political leader who’s willing to risk some short-term pain to re-start the economy, thereby safeguarding all of our futures.I know of just such a person, but unfortunately he’s in hospital recovering from coronavirus.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealThe UK government’s measures to contain the coronavirus epidemic are just starting to make a ­dference.And with the three-week lockdown under review tomorrow, now is NOT the time to lt them.After a slow and indecisive start, the measures they now have put in place, including recommendations to stay at home, limiting travel, physical ­distancing, banning large gatherings and shutting shops and pubs, are just starting to show signs that they are slowing the spread of the virus.This means that there are fewer new cases, with fewer people becoming seriously sick and less demand on hospital beds, intensive care and articial ventilation.This means that the pressure on health services is reduced, which, in turn, will lead to fewer deaths from Covid- and other causes.Without the actions that have been taken and just letting the epidemic run its course, we would be likely to see more than half the population infected, and an overwhelmed health system with maybe five million hospital admissions and at least , deaths.The measures that have been taken in the UK have been of moderate strength compared to other countries.In France and Spain, the lockdown has been more severe, while in Sweden it has been less strict.The coronavirus epidemic can be thought of like a fire.If we starve a fire of oxygen, then the flames will stop and it will die down.So it is with the epidemic — reduce transmission from person to person and the number of cases will go down.Butyou let the oxygen come back too early, any embers in the fire will light up again and it will restart.So,we relax the lockdown too early, while there is still transmission of the virus going on, then the epidemic will restart.And that means that we would have wasted the efforts we have made so far.When transmission has stopped, or is at low enough levels that it can be monitored and each case and their contacts identied, isolated and treated, then the lockdown can be relaxed.We have not yet reached the peak of the epidemic, and we do not yet have the infrastructure in place for the systematic testing that will be needed to identy new cases, so now is not the time to relax the lockdown measures.Some people have talked about the serious damage done to the economy by measures the Government has put in place and the social disruption these have caused, in order to protect the public health of the nation.They have argued the lockdown will cause more harm than good in the long term. This is a  dilemma.Every le matters. Each person lost is a family member, a friend, a neighbour, a human being.They are not a number on a spreadsheet.This lockdown is the only way for us to get back on our feet.If left uncontrolled, the coronavirus by itself will cause social and economic disruption as well as damaging public health.It doesn’t need any help from politicians.It is up to us all, for the sake of ourselves, our families and our loved ones, to follow the rules, and our solidarity will allow the country totowards normal as soon as possible.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’ve never been so pleased to see my copy spiked.We now know from the PM himself just how close he came to death. But had things turned out dferently, my first sentence would still ring true.Boris would have paid the ultimate price for Covid-.The killer virus was spawned in China’s primitive “wet markets” and concealed by the country’s secretive communist regime and blamed by China on America and the West.Beijing’s claim of only , dead is a sick joke. The true figure could be ten times as high — or more.This, remember, is the regime that still lies about the thousands slaughtered in the  Tiananmen Square massacre.Yet China, having destroyed lives and livelihoods around the globe, is emerging as the big winner from its own pandemic.Like vultures hovering over roadkill, leaders of the world’s second-biggest economy are eyeing up the casualties of this made in-China calamity.Covid- risks opening the door to Beijing’s dominance over world trade and commerce, at unimaginable cost to our freedoms and democracy.Rattled world leaders, from Australia to Germany, are drafting emergency laws to prevent China mopping up crown jewels in pharmaceuticals, minerals, articial intelligence and robot technology.But it is probably too late. The West has turned a blind eye to China’s decades of industrial espionage and its cut-price grab for market share.Germany, Europe’s largest economy, is utterly dependent on cheap, heavily subsidised Chinese components and the VW and Mercedes car sales that account for a third of their profits.Suicidally, it will see Chinese cash as a passport out of the crisis.“We have grown too idle and too comfortable to want to do the things the Chinese do for us,” says a Cabinet insider.The world stood silent as China’s Belt And Road programme gobbled up key ports and industries, rare earth minerals and rich farmland across Africa and the Third World.Beijing is now rubbing its hands at the prospect of fresh bargains.Household-name firms here and in Europe are struggling to survive the lockdown. Some will never reopen their doors.The best might end up in Beijing at fire-sale prices.China has already seized a big stake in the UK with its richly subsidised £billion contract for the Hinkley Point nuclear power station in Somerset.Telecoms giant Huawei has its sticky fingers all over our sensitive G superhighway — a decision which must now surely be reversed.The image of communist China as a civilised equal partner is a dangerous fantasy.“China is not and never will be our friend,” a senior minister warns. “But it is the only one with ready cash and all our markets have collapsed because of something China started.“Our economy is being shattered and it is their fault. The idea of selling them some of our best companies is horrying.”China’s own economy has been hammered too. But it remains a ruthless totalitarian state which brooks no opposition.The brutal incarceration of a million Uighur Muslims in “re-education” camps is a blot on the civilised world.

And the moment before that.And probably every spare moment since he was obliged to leave the Sandy Lane Hotel, Barbados, to go through the motions at this old ITV circus, for the th time of asking.Britain’s Got Talent, which began with Ant and Dec sentimentally evoking all the things they love about this great country of ours.The White Clfs of Dover, Blackpool Tower, Edinburgh Castle, Russian sausage dog dancers, a Belgian contortionist, from Got Talent Espana, who scuttled across the stage in the spider position. That sort of quintessentially British thing.There was also, you probably sensed, a collective feeling Britain’s Got Talent didn’t just have a responsibility to lt the nation’s collective mood, over the following  minutes, but a moral duty.An unfair burden to put on any show and a forlorn hope, I thought, given the production has, for many years, involved nothing more inspirational than mixing and matching acts from the worldwide “Talent” franchise with the sort of homegrown sob stories which, however worthy and sincere, can feel a bit beside-the-point compared to the nightmare that’s just engulfed the world.And so it mostly proved on Saturday’s episode.Opinions here will dfer, I realise. In the latter category, though, we had a choir and foster care dancer Yakub, who won me over instantly with his modesty and tact as he announced: “My dream is to dance on . . . I’ve forgotten what I was going to say.” In the former, there was the Belgian contortionist, Papi Flex, an Indian dance troupe and Russia’s Diana Vedyashinka, who has spent the past  years teaching five dachshunds to stand hind-legged on a podium.An admission that made me feel slightly better about spending a similar amount of time watching EastEnders, but not much.There were also, of course, acts that fitted neither category, like James Piper, who’s “a personal trainer by day, magician by night”, meaning he can probably make haemorrhoids appear from nowhere.There was only one person, though, who genuinely lted the gloom.That was the brilliant comedian Steve Royle, from Phoenix Nights and Car Share, whose riotous act, pretending to shove ping-pong balls up his fundament, was funny enough even without the earnest health and safety caption from ITV: “Do not try this at home.” For five glorious minutes I forgot lockdown and began wondering about Steve’s next routine. Then I had to check myself.Because that is the sad and unavoidable issue with these BGT auditions. Unless they’ve got about  weeks of material, coronavirus means it’s a series currently going nowhere.Attempt to press ITV on this matter and all it can tell you is: “We are working with our production colleagues to see how we can make the BGT live shows work in an ever-changing situation.”Mind you, attempt to read Simon Cowell’s mind at the moment and I’m sure you’ll get a far more succinct response.“A jetski.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which month of the year was named after the Roman emperor Augustus Hardball, Ore Oduba: “Which animal has large breeds called Clydesdale and Shire ”Ben Shephard: “On a computer keyboard the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”And Ben Shephard: “Gerald Ford served as US President in which decade of the th century ”A BALLSY move, I thought, for ITV to screen a drama comedy about Who Wants To Be A Millionaire’s coughing cheats during the coronavirus outbreak.The dark irony is, though, it was the only show this past week that was good enough to make me forget the ongoing medical crisis for its duration.The second assumption was that Quiz would stand or fall on Michael Sheen’s impression of Tarrant.It doesn’t. And that’s probably just as well, as it’s a slightly hit-and-miss turn. One moment he’s Tarrant, the next he’s Tommy Cooper, but he always looks more like Les Dennis.Luckily for Quiz, however, it barely matters because James Graham’s script sings and Matthew Macfadyen delivers a performance that’s worthy of award nominations playing the thick-as-a-brick Major Charles Ingram. There are issues as well, obviously.Mark Bonnar’s accent sinks somewhere between Stranraer and Larne as Celador boss Paul Smith and there’s an air of ITV self congratulation in the opening hour about Millionaire’s ratings.A dangerous game to play when you’ve now got Secrets Of The Driving Test filling the show’s slot.All is forgiven and forgotten with tonight’s brilliant second instalmentthough, which concentrates on the coughing episode itself and the fallout, as ITV execs try to work out who they should call at Scotland Yard.“It’s the Celebrity Crime Squad.”“Really  It sounds like a s**t detective show.”“It sounds like something we’d make.”Quite.Manny Monthe: “- is a dangerous scoreline because the next goal wins.”Ian Wright: “Pep Guardiola came in and literally cut Joe Hart’s legs off.”Gary Lineker: “Rafa’s comeback in the Champions League final was his finest moment in the Premier League.”IN the continued absence of live sport, the contest of the week was The Great Celebrity Bake Off, on Channel , where two veteran camera-chasers battled it out for screen time and the winner’s apron.A Holly Willoughby on This Morning B Princess Fiona in Shrek The Musical ITV’s hugely entertaining drama Quiz.

It’s no wonder so many bosses and workers are confused – lawyers are too!Without statutes in place and with regulations changing, it can be hard to provide a definitive answer. The Government has announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which means thatyou both agree, your employer can put you on temporary leave .This applies when they are unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of Covid-. If you are furloughed, you will be paid  per cent of your wages by the Government, up to a monthly cap of £,.It sounds straightforward, but your own unique circumstances can make things tricky.  I have been inundated with questions from people who have been furloughed, had their salary cut or lost their jobs.Here, I have provided my answers to some of your most common queries.Q I STARTED a new job shortly before the lock-down. My new company has advised me it cannot pay me the  per cent government pay because I didn’t start before February . What can I do A Annoyingly for you, your new company is almost certainly right. Unless you were on the payroll by February  they are not legally bound to extend the furlough scheme to you. There are talks about this being changed and lots of pressure on the Government because there are a lot of people in your position. In the meantime, you are entitled to Universal Credit — apply now.Q I WAS late getting to work at a food processing plant due to a change in bus timetables caused by the lockdown. My boss said this was a disciplinary offence and fired me. Is this legal A This is probably not legal. If you have been employed for two years or more this counts as unfair dismissal. If you took your employer to an employment tribunal you would have a good chance of winning.  If you haven’t been employed there for  months you would still be entitled to pay for your notice period.  It is possible you could bring a claim for breach of contract as your employer has almost certainly failed to uphold their own disciplinary procedures. You may also be entitled to a claim for discrimination.  Write to this firm making it clear the country is watching their behaviour — as am I.Q I AM on furlough but my employer is holding back a week’s wages I earned before I was furloughed, saying I will get them when my employment starts again. Can he do this  A Your employer cannot do this, unless it was agreed in a contract. You were promised this money and it has absolutely nothing to do with you being furloughed. I have had a number of messages about this unlawful practice and I understand employers are trying to protect cashflow. Butyou were promised this money your firm is not entitled to withhold it.  It may be that, like many others, you will have to work with your employerthey need that money to stay afloat and protect your job, but make sure they put in writing that the money will be forthcoming in due course. Waiting a while for the money may be better than your company going bust.Q AM I entitled to get another job – say, in a supermarket – while I am on furlough from my employer A I have been inundated with people asking this, but the law is not clear. My view is that unless the contract you have with your current employer specically states you cannot take another job , there is no reason why you cannot during this time. There is nothing as it stands in legislation that prevents you from doing this. The government regulationsare not clear and need clarication.  Importantly, disclosure to your current employer is critical. Do not accept another job without giving clear written notice to your current employer that you are taking up other employment while furloughed.Q MY employer wants me to accept a ten per cent pay cut. I checked my contract and I don’t believe they have the power to do this. Do I have a way of resisting this A Your employer cannot unilaterally decide to cut your wages. You have signed a contract and they have promised to pay you. But these are unprecedented times and there is legal provision which may, in certain circumstances, allow employers to sack you and then,necessary, re-employ you on a reduced salary. Multiple employers have asked staff to take a reduction in order for them to survive. The critical thing is thatyou accept such an offer it must have an end date, in writing. You can’t be forced to accept a contract change, including a salary cut. But be warned thatyou do not, your employer can put you on furlough, which will only cover  per cent of your salary.Q I RESIGNED from my job but my new one has fallen through due to the virus. Where can I get help  A I am afraid you will have to claim Universal Credit. It may be worth writing to your old employer to seethere is work still availble, but your legal remedies are limited. The Citizens Advice Bureau is updating its advice on this all the time.Q MY EMPLOYER has gone into administration. Can I still be furloughed A The law makes clear that administrators, independent professionals responsible for either salvaging a bankrupt company or ensuring creditors are paid, can apply to the government furlourgh scheme to ensure an income for staff. However, the administrator will probably focus on attempting to pay creditors and shareholders. Do not let them do this. Get together with co-employees and write to the administrator insisting you’ll not be forgotten and nor will their behaviour.Q I’VE HAD to cancel my holiday and my employer needs me to work during the time I had booked off. Usually we are not entitled to carry annual leave into the next year, butthey are requiring me to work, surely I must have the right to do so A Good news, the Government has amended regulations so workers can carry over up to four weeks holiday into the next two holiday years. This applies where it has not been possible for you to take some or all of your leave because of the virus. However, it has to be because you were required to work.Q I BECAME self-employed in February. Am I entitled to government grants A It looks like you are not, but this may change. You need to have accounts for   to be entitled to assistance.

A The furlough scheme covers zero-hour contract workers so your employer should make an application on your behalf. Get in touch and ask them to explain their policy. It costs them nothing to offer you furlough so I do not understand why they have not.Q I WORK in a shop and my employer has made no effort to make the environment safe for the workers. In other shops I have seen screens at tills and employees issued with gloves and masks. We have none of that. I don’t feel safe. Am I entitled to stop working without risking my job A It is shocking that there are no specic health and safety regulations protecting workers like you which have the full force of law. I do not have a clear answer about whether you are entitled to refuse to go to workthe business is open and offering essential services. However, in due course your business failing to make the environment safe could be grounds for constructive dismissalyou were to make the decision to walk away. I urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to write to your line manager asking them to provide safety equipment, making it clear the environment is unsafe and explaining that you will be considering your optionsadequate safety measures are not introduced.Q I WANT to go on furlough, but my employer has cut my hours by half. How can I make them furlough me so I can get  per cent of my pay instead of  per cent A Your boss can’t just slash your hours by half, that is a straightforward breach of contract. If there is no work for you to do then furlough should be offered to you. Write to your employer at once asking for them to explain why they think this is lawful. I look forward to their answer.Q I CAN’T work because I have to shield myself due to health reasons. I asked my employer to furlough me and they said they couldn’t because I can’t work, so I am currently on unpaid leave. Is this fair A  This all depends on your circumstances. If you are able to work from home, and are healthy enough to do so, your employer should offer you this option. If your employer is unable to operate, or there is no work you could doyou did not have to shield yourself, then you should be offered furlough. Butthe business is an essential service that has remained open, and you have to attend work in person, the remedy is to apply for statutory sick pay .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are talking about emerging from the lockdown, which signals a more gradual process.You dont exit viruses. That hasnt happened in all human history. They stay around, so we will be looking very closely at what happens in other countries that are ahead of us in the curve when they start to lt their own restrictions.Ministers face the challenge of trying to prevent a second wavethey act too quickly, but risk seeing the economy completely grind to a haltthey wait too long.Divisions are already opening up in the Cabinet about when is the best time to start easing off - some want to start on May , but others are urging them to wait until May .Another source said that some Brits could be too nervous to go out again - even when the lockdown measures are lted.One source told the paper: We wont be able to lt the lockdown until the public feels ready for it.We have to take the public with us, by unwinding the social distancing measures rather than stopping them suddenly, and its up to us to make the case for it.Here are some of the options for lting Britains three-week long shut down when the Government feels the evidence will show its safe to do so.Experts said in a study last week that the impact of closing schools on the spread of coronavirus was small anyway.Ministers were expecting around a fth of pupils to stay in school - just those of key workers - but in fact just  per cent are there at the moment.As parents struggle to work from home with their kids around and help them keep up with homework, going back to school would be a welcome first step for many to try and get back to some kind of normal.At the moment only food shops, DIY stores, banks and several other forms of essential shops are open.The Governments first step could be allowing more shops toto normal -they can try and keep some form of social distancing.Clothes and charity shops or other retailers could be added to the list of shops that are permitted to open their doors again and get back to normal.As younger people are less at risk from becoming seriously ill from the virus and are less likely to have enough savings to weather out the crisis, some experts have said younger people should be allowed toto normal le first.When coronavirus social distancing restrictions can be softened, they reckon --year-olds who no longer live with their parents should be released first.They are also more likely to be working in sectors where they cant work from home, and will rely on the economy opening up again for them to continue to work.Britain is still searching for an antibody tests to show whether people have had the bug in the past.Its hoped that once people have had it, they will be immune and not able to catch it again.If thats proven and a reliable test can be found, the Health Secretary has said he would look at issuing immunity certicates or wristbands - to allow people who have had the illness and recovered to go out safely.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealSome sectors could be allowed to go back to work first - including non-essential manufacturing and construction.Any jobs where people can show they can safely work apart are more likely to be able to start up again.EvenBritains rules dont allow for non-essential travel at the moment, Britain could relax rules on gatherings of more than two people.It could allow neighbours or friends and family to visit each other in small numbers, while keeping risks to a minimum.At the moment Brits are only allowed out for exercise, to get food, medicine, or take care of a vulnerable person.The Government could relax that by agreeing that people are able to go outside their own homes, and dont need a reason to be able to do so.This is likely to be the very last stage of the lockdown ending - and wont be on the cards anytime soon.Any events where people are packed in close spaces are likely to be put off until the number of cases has considerably dropped.To start with, pubs or restaurants could open again as take-away only - as some did in the early stages of the lockdown.Or sports matches could be played behind closed doors - with fans able to watch on TV instead. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   GL-graphic-Corona-testing-April.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

along with other tests involving viruses and bats - after receiving .grant from the US Government.Covid- was originally thought to have come from a so-called “wet market” in the Chinese city.But there has been mounting speculation linking the disease to the lab, which is one of two in Wuhan, and a possible leak.Scientists at WIV experimented on bats as part of a project funded by the US National Institutes of Health, which licences it to receive American money, the Mail on Sunday reports.Research published in April  probed the cross-species transmission of coronaviruses from bats, to other animals, and then to humans.The study - titled fatal swine acute diarrhoea syndrome caused by an HKU-related coronavirus of bat origin - was investigating a bat-related coronavirus outbreak on Chinese pig farms.Bats were captured in a cave and samples were taken from the creatures.Scientists then grew the virus in a lab before injecting it into three-day-old piglets.The sick animals were then killed and their intestines were ground up into a slurry and fed to other piglets.In the study, scientists wrote: This study highlights the importance of identying coronavirus ersity and distribution in bats to mitigate future outbreaks that could threaten livestock, public health and economic growth.The £ million lab is the most advanced laboratory of its type on the Chinese mainland and is based ten miles from the now infamous “wet market”.Other research was published in November  in a paper entitled: “Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus.”The research involved capturing bats and gathering their feces in a cave in Yunnan, in south-western China.Scientists spent five years monitoring horseshoe bats, which led to the discovery of  new coronaviruses.It concluded: “This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.”A second bat study , published in March , found % of fruit bats are carrying some form of coronavirus - highlighting the “importance of virus surveillance” and the potential of an outbreak.Scientists at WIV were the first to link the new coronavirus to bats - with it being found to  per cent similar to a virus held in the lab.The institute is classed as biosafety level  - the highest classication of its kind.Technicians in the lab either have to work in highly sterile cabinets or wear full body safety suits.BSL- labs are the only places in the world where scientists can study diseases that have no cure.The state-run People’s Daily newspaper boasted in  that the lab was capable of conducting experiments with “highly pathogenic microorganisms”.Unveried local claims have suggested workers at the lab became infected after being sprayed with blood, and then carried in infection into the local population.It emerged last week that British intelligence is considering the possibility that the virus leaked from a lab.Senior sources reportedly admitted while the “balance of scientic advice” is that the virus originated naturally - the leak theory is now on the table.Downing Street has said it “does not recognise” the claims made by the source.Theories about the origins of coronavirus being linked to a lab in Wuhan have been batted around since the early days out of the outbreak.Chinese officials have previously attempted to dismiss claims of a leak as internet rumours.The government source’s comments come as pressure ratchets up on China to come clean over the outbreak.It also emerged WIV was recruiting experts on bats and coronaviruses six days before China admitted it was facing the new virus on December .However, there is absolutely no suggestion the virus is manmade - scientists are confident it originated naturally after studying its genome.Following the coronavirus outbreak, China has issued new laws that call for facilities to ensure “biological safety” and improve management of viruses.A leak from a Chinese lab led to an outbreak of Sars that killed one person and infected nine others in .The Chinese government admitted the leak was down to negligence and that five officials were punished.China has been accused of attempting to cover-up the initial outbreak as the virus took hold in the city of Wuhan.A doctor who first warned about the virus was threatened by police, and then last month Chinese officials suggested the US military may have been responsible for coronavirus.Biosecurity researcher Richard Ebright, a professor at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology, said the coronavirus may have come from a leak.He said: Bat coronaviruses are collected and studied by laboratories in multiple parts of China — including Wuhan Municipal CDC and Wuhan Institute of Virology.Therefore, the first human infection also could have occurred as a laboratory accident.China’s top virologist on bat-borne viruses, Shi Zhengli - known as Bat Woman - has sworn on her le that virus did not leak from her lab in Wuhan.She blamed the virus has being spread by “nature punishing the human race for keeping uncivilized living habits”.The researcher has told those claiming the virus came from her lab to “shut their stinking mouths”.But she previously admitted she had “lost sleep” fearing the virus may have leaked from the research facility.And it has since been claimed that she was “muzzled” after revealing Covid-’s genetic composition – crucial for developing tests and vaccines.In a letter to the Mail on Sunday, Chinese embassy official Zen Rong said: “Such reports completely disregard the tremendous efforts and huge sacrice of China and its people, and deny Chinas signicant contribution to global public health and safety.“China wasted no time in identying the viruss pathogen, sharing the genetic sequence with the World Health Organisation, taking the most effective, strict and comprehensive measures to contain the spread of the disease, sharing experience with other countries in need, and providing assistance to more than  countries, including the UK, and to four international organisations.”In a statement, an embassy spokesman added: “There has been no scientic or medical conclusion yet on the origin of Covid-, as relevant tracing work is still underway.“The WHO has made repeated statements that what the world is experiencing now is a global phenomenon, the source is undetermined, the focus should be on containment and any stigmatizing language referring to certain places must be avoided.”In a statement, WIV said the conspiracy reports had “received close attention from all walks of le” and “caused great harm to our research staff on the front line of scientic research” back in FebruaryLab chiefs said staff had been working around the clock since the end of  to trace the source of the coronavirus and improve detection rates - adding the theories seriously interfered with their efforts.And despite the speculation, the World Health Organisation praised China and President Xi Jinping for their handling of Covid- back in February.WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “The logic doesn’t support the idea [of a cover up]. It’s wrong to jump to conclusions.”He added: Nobody knows for surethey were hiding [anything].More than million people have now been infected worldwide as the death toll nears ,.Scientists are still scrambling to trace the source of the virus and to fully understand the infectionIt emerged today more than  people in South Korea have tested positive for the bug after being given the all-clear - sparking fears of reactivation.Meanwhile, Britain is expected to enter a further three weeks of lockdown as the death-toll surpassed ,.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

or even less - apart.It comes after cops cracked down on droves of sunbathing Brits in parks and beaches with megaphones as thousands soaked up the sun over the Easter weekend.Prof Dingwall instead urged the Government to relax their stringent lockdown rules and stop harassing sunbathers in parks.He told The : If it was entirely down to me I would be calling the dogs off.I don’t think it is appropriate to harass sunbathers.It is an indictment of the political and scientic elite that they are not recognising that people living in flats and social housing do not have an alternative to going to parks.And Prof Dingwall added that the chances of catching coronavirus through outdoor transmissions was extremely low.The probability for example of transmission from a jogger running past you is zero, he said.The senior advisor accused some mathematical modellers of promoting an “all or nothing” strategy on social distancing that was being pushed hard by the Government.He said the evidence basis for the need for two-metres’ social distancing was based on studies conducted indoors in laboratory conditions where the virus spread one metre.However, the distance had been doubled to two metres to offer further reassurance.Prof Dingwall sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group , which advises the Government “on the threat posed by new and emerging respiratory viruses”.His comments were supported by another senior scientist, who advised the Government but did not wish to be named.The well-placed source said: I commissioned a rapid evidence synthesis on this topic.“We could find no positive evidence that this virus has ever been transmitted outdoors .The source did admit, however, that that does not mean outdoor transmission cannot occur - butsocial distancing is maintained then the risk of transmission in outdoor settings looks to be very low.Prof Dingwalls comments come ahead of a national review of the coronavirus lockdown this week.The lockdown is being reviewed by the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieswhich meets today and again on Thursday to consider its effectiveness, three weeks after it was announced by Boris Johnson.Public sunbathing in parks is currently against the UK governments strict coronavirus restrictions.At the moment, people are only allowed to leave their homes to travel to and from work for key workers only, shop for basic necessities, take one form of exercise a day, to go to a medical appointment or provide care to a vulnerable person.If youre lucky enough to have a garden that catches the sun then you are allowed to sunbathe, but friends and family who dont live in your household arent allowed to join you.You can be fined for sunbathing in a public space  - and for refusing to stay indoors are £, or £paid within  days.If you are caught a second time you will be fined £ and each time you do it again your fine will be doubled.Heath Secretary Matt Hancock reminded Brits they are allowed to leave the house to exercise but sunbathingis banned.Sunbathing is against the rules that have been set out for important public health reasons, told Sky News.I wish I didnt have to say this, but I do because the whole country wants to come through this crisis as quickly as possible and the fastest way to come through the crisis, and save lives and protect the NHS is... to follow the guidance and stay at home unless youve got one of the four reasons weve set out.Mr Hancock said the Government was allowing people to exercise outside on their own or with members of their household because of the positive benefits to your physical and your mental health, but he flagged further restrictionspeople broke the rules.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealIf the result of that is that too many people go out and flout the other rules because they say wellI can exercise then its fine for me to do other things then Im afraid we will have to take action, he said.If you dont want us to take the step to ban exercise of all forms outside the home, you have got to follow the rules.Lets not have a minority spoiling it for everybody.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

after analysing  patients who tested positive for Covid-.And the researchers found that infected people frequently experienced neurological effects in addition to and also independent of respiratory symptoms.Of those in the group,  per cent experienced some type of neurological symptom.Headache was reported in  per cent of the patients, dizziness was observed in about  per cent, and muscle inflammation and nerve pain occurred in about  per cent.In general, the more severe the infection got, the more frequent and intense the neurological complications became - with some experiencing confusion, seizure and stroke.Sometimes these symptoms were present in tandem with respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or fever.However, in other instances, people experienced the neurological symptoms alone with no signs of respiratory distress.Health experts say it is not surprising that Covid- can trigger neurological symptoms - especially when you look back at previous strains of coronavirus including severe acute respiratory syndromeand Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus .Both SARS and MERS affected the central nervous system of some patients - triggering le-threatening neurological complications including strokes, seizures, encephalitis and meningitis.It is also not unheard of to see neurological complications, from headaches and trouble concentrating to strokes and seizures, in people with other respiratory illnesses like the flu or pneumonia.As it is with most things related to Covid-, scientists are still in the very early stages of collecting data that fully makes sense of what’s happening in the central nervous system.However, its not far off to assume that could happen with Covid-, too.Health experts say the deadly bug may be causing neurological problems as the virus latches onto a receptor in our bodies called ACE-, which is primarily located in the lungs.However, according to Igor Koralnik, chief of neuroinfectious diseases and global neurology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, ACE- is also present in other parts of the body, including the nervous system and vessels going to the brain.The other potential mechanism behind the neurological symptoms is called a secondary infection, which means that a person’s respiratory infection is putting so much strain on the body that it’s triggering a major neurological problem.“For example,somebody has dficulty breathing and they don’t get enough oxygen in their body and their brain, then they will have altered mental ,” Koralnik told HuffPost.Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, two severe complications observed in people with Covid-, can cause multiple organ failure, which can damage the brain.“The brain is the organ that suffers the most from lack of oxygen,” Koralnik said.If you do not have any other symptoms along with your headache then it is highly unlikely that you have coronavirus.The NHS will not test you for coronavirus on the basis of a headache alone.If you have abnormal headaches, or they are particularly bad, then it is still wise to seek medical advice via the NHS  online service.As well as neurological symptoms, doctors have also warned that a loss of taste or smell could also be a sign of coronavirus.The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology, which represents experts in ear, nose and throat medicine, has said that those who lose these senses should self-isolate immediately - evenyou have no other symptoms.They added that the eye infection conjunctivitis may also be another sign.Other signs of coronavirus may include fatigue and muscle soreness.Around one out of every six who gets Covid- become seriously ill and develops dficulty breathing, according to the World Health Organisation .Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are at most risk developing serious illness.Despite this, on the complete other end of the spectrum, doctors say some people with coronavirus might not even show symptoms at all.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealAndyou dont show any symptoms -

It can take hours to get sunburn from UVB, but with UVC it takes seconds.A study on the Sars virus also found little effect, with the virus remaining unchanged after being exposed to UVA for  minutes.WHO have urged people not to use UV lamps to sterilise hands or other areas of skin in a bid to beat coronavirus.The organisation said: UV lamps should not be used to sterilise hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation.While natural light from outside may help sht the virus, air flow could change how the virus settles in your house.Other research published in the American Society for Microbiology’s journal mSystems added that the air could increase outside air fraction and increase total air change rate which would stop the virus settling on a surface.Previous studies looking at other infectious diseases, including Sars and influenza also found a reduction in the spread of the virus in buildings with better ventilation and air movement.However, scientists add it could later settle on another surface, so additional measures of hand washing are still recommended.Coronavirus can live in the air for hours, according to new research.Researchers used a nebulizer device to put samples of the virus into the air, the same way it would end up theresomeone were to cough.They found the virus, still viable, could be detected in the air up to three hours later. A shocking new animation has proven that the UKs two metre - or six feet - social distancing rule might not be enough to keep you safe during the pandemicyoure out jogging.Tech company Ansys created a video which reveals you could come into contact with droplets of Covid- evenyou stay six feet behind another person while you are walking, running or cycling.The experts say that because of this running side-by-side could be less risky than in single file, as you are far less likely to be struck with any potentially infected fluids.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Commons business will resume on April  after an extended Easter break, despite calls for an early recall. Prof Russell, director of the constitution unit at UCL, and Dr Fox suggested that as far as possible MPs should stay away from Westminster in the interests of safety and to set a national example. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has already suggested that MPs should be allowed to participate in proceedings virtuallythe physical presence of members, or too many members, in the palace is not appropriate. The suggestions from Prof Russell and Dr Fox include:The introduction of electronic voting The ability to have three or four urgent questions, lasting up to  minutes each, every sitting day Giving MPs the chance to ask follow-up questions at Prime Ministeraposs Questions An increased frequency in appearances by the Prime Minister, or whoever is deputising for him as he recovers from coronavirus, before the Liaison Committee The possible introduction of a Coronavirus Select Committee.The pair acknowledged that a sht to a virtual Parliament may present dficulties for media coverage. But they argued thatlive broadcast is temporarily compromised, that may be a necessary price to pay - and committees have already experimented with delayed broadcasts and video clips. Prof Russell said: There is clearly a widespread desire to get Parliament up and running again, and members will be keen to co-operate and will hopefully be flexible, accepting that virtual working will require some compromises. But itaposs really, really important that the Government does not just present members with a fait accompli - there needs to be proper consultation, and any changes should be strictly time-limited, with opportunities for feedback and regular review. Dr Fox said: Adversarial party politics rightly takes a back seat in a time of national crisis, but Parliamentaposs collective responsibility to hold the executive to account is enduring. Extraordinary arrangements are neededParliament is to go fully aposvirtualapos. But any new arrangements must ensure fair representation for all members and parties and the crisis and Parliamentaposs response to it should not become a pretext to sht power even further towards the executive. The Government is expected to set out its approach for Parliamentaposslater this week.

Carers say they have been abandoned to their fate without enough protective equipment. Care home workers are struggling to get tested despite Michael Goveaposs daughter being given a test - allowing him toto work.

Testing a member of the household ensured that Michael Gove could get back to work to drive forward the governmentaposs response at a critical time. Shadow Care Minister Liz Kendall said: “It is extremely worrying that only  social care workers have so far been tested.“Around . million people work in social care, supporting vulnerable elderly and disabled people in their own homes and in residential care. “The Government must act urgently to ensure front line care staff get the testing and PPE they need to keep people safe and avoid even more deaths from this awful virus.” It may be that more than  social care workers were tested in total,they were classed as NHS staff or hospital inpatients but not recorded separately.

And because of the time lag the real number of care home deaths will be far higher. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey today claimed there were about , care home deaths.

Among those applauding have been Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and other senior Tory ministers. Because of this, thousands have shared a  story - including on the Mirror - that showed Tory MPs cheering as they blocked a full pay rise for nurses. The story isnapost fake news: Tory MPs did vote down a proper pay rise for nurses in  and they did cheer when the vote was announced. However, itaposs inevitable that some details are lost in translation or over the passage of time. So as a public service, hereaposs what you need to know about the vote. What happened on  June   Tory and DUP MPs defeated a Labour amendment to the  Queenaposs Speech in the House of Commons. Among other things, the amendment aimed to call on the Government to end the public sector pay cap and give the emergency and public services a fair pay rise. However, it was voted down by  votes to .  Tory MPs and  DUP MPs voted against the amendment. In favour were  Labour MPs,  SNP MPs,  Lib Dem MPs,  Plaid Cymru,  Green and  Independent. What was actually blocked     The amendment would not have given nurses and other NHS staff a legally binding pay rise. But it would have sent a powerful and, arguably, a morally binding signal that what they were getting wasnapost enough. At the time of the vote, annual pay rises for NHS staff were still capped at the % a year that theyaposd been since . The amendment also called for a number of other things - see below. So did the government refuse completely to give nurses a pay rise   No. Itaposs completely true that at the time of the vote, the government hadnapost confirmed any extra help for NHS staff other than a % rise every year. Thataposs why MPsapos decision angered many campaigners and NHS workers at the time. But the following year, in summer , the government did eventually confirm NHS staff would get a three-year deal worth between .% and %. Critics of the government would argue that it only changed its course because of years of pressure by Labour, including that vote on  June . Meanwhile, No officials had also made noises about changing policy on the day of the vote, only for their message to be mired in confusion. At pm, a Downing Street spokesman said then-PM Theresa May had heard the message of the election and would listen to pay reviews which have branded the cap unsustainable. But pressed for more detail at pm, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman in No then told journalists repeatedly: Our policy has not changed.    It depends who you ask. Labour would say itaposs because they didnapost have NHS staff high enough up their priority list - and werenapost prepared to help them after years of Tory austerity. Tories, on the other hand, accused Labour of using the issue as a political football by lumping in lots of other complaints into the amendment. The amendment couldnapost be split into dferent bits, so had to be either approved or rejected all in one go. Then-Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said just before the vote: The party of the NHS is not the party that uses it to milk votes it is the party that fights to make it better for patients. And so it was that Tory whips ordered their MPs to vote against the amendment - and it was defeated. Itaposs worth saying the resounding result came despite some Tory MPs wanting to see nurses get a pay rise. One of them, former nurse Maria Caulfield, said nursesapos pay cannot be right and urged a complete rethink. Why did MPs cheer     The simple answer is - because they won. As explained above, the vote came at the end of a torturous day in Westminster where the debate descended into angry party politics. The government, which had a tiny working majority, was relieved to have won by a comfortable margin. So Tory MPs who cheered were gripped by that party-political excitement rather than deliberately putting across a message to NHS workers. But in doing so they created a scene that, in retrospect, appeared insulting and disrespectful to many NHS workers. What was the full text of the amendment  But respectfully regret that the [Queenaposs] Speech fails to end cuts to the police and the fire service commend the response of the emergency services to the recent terrorist attacks and to the Grenfell Tower fire call on the Government to recruit more police officers and fire-fighters and further call on the Government to end the public sector pay cap and give the emergency and public services a fair pay rise.

And with that rapid change has been a flurry of new announcements from the government. At the moment, Downing Street insists weaposre still on track to meet two crucial targets - , tests a day by May, and , ventilators in the NHS. But each of those targets has been changed over time and each of them has faced accusations of failure along the way. For example, the government said thereaposd be , tests a day within  weeks - three weeks and six days ago. No single day has yet gone above ,.  And Health Secretary Matt Hancock hoped to get , ventilators in the last week, only to get .Overall the government has not broken its promises - but there have definitely been hiccups, and there is still the risk of failure in future.Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey today accepted we’ve definitely had some deficiencies but claimed there is excellent progress on testing.She added: We recognise there are still some gaps but we’re working with the NHS and the private sector to make sure we can reach that capacity. We do have a sufficient number of ventilators right now for the number of people in critical care, but we do anticipate we’ll need more. So what exactly has the UK government promised on ventilators and testing, and how have those pledges evolved halfway down the road  Hereaposs a timeline. Testing Note: Antigen or swab tests showyou currently have coronavirus. Antibody tests showyou have had it in the past and might have some immunity - but none have been approved for use yet.March : A government statement pledged , swab tests per day, expected to be ready within  weeks after criticism the UK wasnapost testing enough people for Covid-.March :Boris Johnson added to the pledge, saying the UK would be going hopefully very soon up to , per day. But he didnapost say when or how. His figure included both swab and antibody tests.March : National Infection Service director Sharon Peacock said millions of antibody tests had been ordered - and she expected them to go through the approval process by the end of the week. This did not happen.April : Health Secretary Matt Hancock pledged , tests a day by the end of April. That includes both types of test, with , in NHS or Public Health England, and the others in private labs.April : Despite Sharon Peacockaposs comments on March , Mr Hancock admitted the government had not yet found a single antibody test that works. He saidneeds be, the , target would be filled entirely by antigen tests - but could not guarantee it.April : Mr Hancock announced there is finally enough capacity to test all NHS staff who need it - but not yet enough capacity for all social care workers who need it. April : The most recent figures show , tests were carried out on Easter Sunday. With days left to hit the , target, and weeks to hit ,, no single day has yet seen more than , tests.April : No announced that as of Easter Sunday, , carersor their relatives have been tested for Covid-. But only  social care workers have been tested, because there is still not enough spare capacity for all those with symptoms.Ventilators    March : With , ventilators in the system at the start of the outbreak, manufacturing firm Smiths Group said the government had a target to get to , ventilators - including , extra in the following two weeks.March : Government said the number of ventilators in the system had risen from , to ,.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email Tory Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he doesnapost think Universal Basic Income is the right response to coronavirus.Instead Mr Sunak has defended Universal Credit which many of those who have lost their jobs because of covid- and are facing hardship are having to fall back on.Some .million benefit claims have now been made since  coronavirus  began devastating the UK, the Tory welfare chief said today. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said .million claims for  Universal Credit  have now been made since the middle of March - around  times the usual average.On top of that, she said, there have been , claims for aposlegacyapos benefits Jobseekersapos Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance. Just , of the Universal Credit claimants have already received cash since March , after applying for an advance. Others are waiting for money to arrive because there is a five-week standard wait for first payment. The governmentaposs Universal Credit helpline has been struggling with the number of calls - including .million in the first week of Apri. Officials have been forced to quadruple capacity in some areas after being swamped with desperate new claimants to the six-in-one benefit. The figure included .million calls to the DWPaposs helpline on a single day, Monday  March.  Today the Chancellor was asked whether Universal Credit is a good enough safety net and,not, whether he is open to proposals such as Universal Basic Income. I donapost think Universal Basic Income is the right response to this.He added: I think Universal Credit is working well, obviously DWP staff are under strain like many other organisations across the country because theyaposre dealing with people being sick and away as well but I think, given the circumstances, they are processing claims efficiently and effectively.Weaposve provided some extra resource to DWP to help them with that but their staff do deserve praise for what theyaposre doing.  Weaposve also injected extra resources to deal with the particular nature of this crisis into the welfare system whether thataposs strengthening Universal Credit temporarily for this year, working tax credits or, indeed, local housing allowance, local council tax support - all of those interventions which will total several billions of pounds, he said. Because of the unprecedented nature of what weaposre facing will go to supporting the most vulnerable people in our country. Critics say the huge tide of benefit cases is because of holes in the governmentaposs support schemes. Self-employed people can get % of their average profits but the cash is only available in June. And people who started a new job after February  cannot get % of their wage under the governmentaposs furloughed workers scheme.During the daily Downing Street press conference Mr Sunak warned that there are tough times to come after a devastating report said two million jobs could be lost to the  coronavirus  lockdown.He said he was troubled by the projection - but said he was confident that the UK would bounce back quickly when the crisis is over.

The most common symptoms of the virus are a dry cough and high temperature - with the government saying anyone who experiences these must self-isolate for seven days. However, less common signs being reported by those infected include lesions on the feet, testicular pain and a strange aposbuzzingapos or aposfizzingapos sensation on the skin. Others have reported feeling increased levels of mental fatigue or aposbrain fogapos shortly before being diagnosed. Hereaposs a list of some of the less common symptoms that are being increasingly reported by sufferers:Follow all coronavirus updates here on our live blogNeeding the toilet  Another mild symptom of coronavirus that is being reported with increased regularity is the need to go to the toilet more often. Dr Diana Gall explained to the  Express : Digestion problems and changes in bowel habits - particularly looser stools and making more frequent trips to the toilet - are sometimes the first signs that you’re coming down with something, not just with this coronavirus.However, diarrhoea has been reported as an early symptom in patients who have later tested positive for Covid-. A new study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, analysed data  patients with Covid- in China’s Hubei province and found nearly  per cent had diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain. Testicular pain  Another slightly less common symptom of the coronavirus, is testicular pain. Researchers from Hard Medical School  filed a case report about a -year-old man who tested positive for the virus, after going to hospital with a ‘stabbing pain’ in his testicles. While doctors could find nothing wrong with his testicles, and CT scan showed damage in his lungs. Two days later, the man was diagnosed with Covid-. A buzzing sensation One of the more curious symptoms is a buzzing sensation that runs through the body. While it has not been listed as an official symptom to watch out for, many people have posted online about experiencing a aposfizzingapos feeling. Tarana Burke, recognised as the founder of the #MeToo movement, said that her partner had the illness and the sensation that his aposskin felt like it was burningapos. Twitter user @Miafia described having “an electric feeling on my skin.”Dr Daniel Grfin, chief of infectious disease at ProHealth Care Associates in the US, has suggested the feeling may be part of an auto-immune response to a patientsapos nervous system.“Clearly it’s been identied, but we’re just not sure yet how widespread it is,” he told the New York Post. Foot lesions  Medical experts in Spain are currently investigating whether those who have the virus could be identied by small lesions on the feet.Last Thursday, The Spanish General Council of Official Podiatrist Colleges shared a statement revealing that several  coronavirus  patients had lesions on their feet.The statement said: They are purple lesionswhich usually appear on the toes and normally heal without leaving a mark. They added that it was a curious finding which had also been observed in numerous  Covid- patients in Italy and France, as well as Spain, according to dermatologists and podiatrists. The lesions were more commonly noticed in younger people with the virus, including teenagers and children, although some adults were also found to have them. Tummy ache  As with a loss of appetite, enduring a tummy ache may easily be passed off as a sign of something more innocuous. However, a newly published study by the American Journal of Gastroenterology links tummy problems to Covid-. They found that .% of  people who have been infected by the coronavirus in Chinaaposs Hubei province had digestive symptoms such as diarrhoea that can cause tummy pain, A dry cough  Perhaps the most recognisable of the Covid- symptoms, given how dferent it can sound compared to a typical cough. The cough is generally new for you - or dferentyou generally have a smokeraposs cough - and persistant. More often than not it will last for at least half a day or longer. Loss of taste and smell Some of the infected have reported experiencing a lack of smell and taste – known as anosmia - despite not having the usual signs of a cough or fever. It is now believed to be a symptom for hidden carriers of Covid-. Professor Nirmal Kumar, head of ENT UK, has urged Britons to self-isolatethey have this symptom. He told Sky News: In young patients, they do not have any signicant symptoms such as the cough and fever, but they may have just the loss of sense of smell and taste, which suggests that these viruses are lodging in the nose. In a statement, ENT UK said: “There is already good evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that signicant numbers of patients with proven covid- infection have developed anosmia hyposmia . Mental fatigue or aposbrain fogapos  Although this has not been officially chalked up as a symptom, Covid- sufferers have reported experiencing mental fatigue.Thea Jourdan told the Mail  that she first thought she may have been infected when she got a tickle in her throat and a headache.The mum-of-three then began to experience brain fog. Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever, the Hampshire woman told the publication. But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder. Others have also reported struggling to hold on to thoughts or remember things throughout the day.

However, the research commissioned by musicMagpie, found almost a fth of adults will simply bin their tech once theyaposve finished with it - eventhe device is still in working order. And more than a third of the , adults polled will hang on to their old gadgets because they aposdonapost know what  to do with them.apos It also emerged the average adult could currently make £,. from trading in the tech in their home, based on the average value musicMagpie will pay customers when they sell technology items. Liam Howley, from musicMagpie, said: Our research has shown that people will own a staggering amount of tech during their letime, much of which will currently be dormant in households, as people donapost know what to do with it after itaposs no longer in use. With spring well underway and people currently being encouraged to stay at home, perhaps this is a good opportunity to have a rummage in those drawers to see what devices can be cleared out. But itaposs wasteful to just leave them tucked away in drawers, and not environmentally friendly to dump them in a bin. By trading in used tech, people can not only make extra cash for themselves, but will ensure their tech is refurbished for the next person to use. The study also found those polled will own  PC monitors,  smartwatches and  MP players during their letime. And during a typical year they will spend almost £ on the latest gadgets and gizmos, with another £.-a-month spent on contracts for devices such as mobile phones. But while three in five claim they aposcouldnapost liveapos without their beloved tech, more than a fth said they tend to replace their old devices because they have become dated. More than two thirds usually purchase new gadgets because their old one has stopped working. It also emerged that when it comes to dumping the products they no longer use,  per cent arenapost sure about how to recycle tech and dispose of it responsibly.  But nearly three quarters have never heard of the term apose-wasteapos - a term to describe discarded electrical items - despite  per cent admitting they contribute to this. And while  per cent recycle whatever they can of plastics, just  per cent have recycled electronics. A quarters have actually made money from recycling old gadgets by selling them on to be recycled or refurbished. But hanging onto the old gadgets could result in lost money as data shows the value of a new iPhone can depreciate by up to £-a-year and Samsung models by up to £. The study also found that despite  per cent of those polled recognising the importance of recycling electronics to help care for the environment,  per cent are more likely to replace a damaged gadget.

Local health Department boss Nguyen Tan Binh confirmed late yesterday that the British tourist tested positive shortly before catching the flight at the airport after being discharged from Danang Hospital following treatment for a coronavirus infection. They said that the -year-old man, who was not named, had been admitted to hospital on March  and released on the March  after testing negative three times. After that, he had been quarantined for another two weeks at a hotel in Danang City in line with guidelines issued by the Health Ministry. He had then flown to Ho Chi Minh City at the end of last week and was tested while staying at an airport hotel while waiting for the next flight. He had actually boarded the flight when the cityaposs Centre for Diseases Control revealed that the man had tested positive for the Covid- virus.  At the heart of the outbreak in February, China had also confirmed cases where people who appeared to have recovered and tested negative were later found to have tested positive, confounding the popular belief that those who survive would be immune at least in the immediate future from catching the disease again. It is reportedly the first time it has happened in Vietnam. Vietnamese officials were unable to say why the disease appeared to have reappeared again and said they had ordered officials to investigate where the man might have come into contact with it again.

Over , face shields were dispatched by volunteers with access to D printing equipment over Easter weekend thanks to money raised by online crowdfunding campaign D Crowd UK.The campaign asks those with resources to D print protective equipment to lend their support, paid for by donations from members of the public. The crowdfunded project has raised more than £, and received more than  requests for at least , face shields, since launching in March.More than  frontline NHS staff have died during the coronavirus pandemic in the UK amid criticism from the government over not providing adequate supplies of Personal Protective Equipment .Faces of the NHS heroes who have died during the coronavirus pandemicOn Saturday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was ‘sorrypeople think there have been PPE failings’. Although D Crowd UK have fundraised £, through their GoFundMe page to support their efforts, it is not enough to keep up to the increasing demand.Gen Ashley, one of the leaders of  D Crowd UK, said: “The orders we’ve received from health and social care organisations demonstrate just how critical the shortage of protective equipment is for frontline workers in the UK. “We are hoping to produce more because we have already seen that the demand is greater than what we were aiming to do, and the crowdfunding needs to continue to get the material we need.” Ben Sauer, also on the DCrowd UK team, said: “We hear first-hand from those on the front line about how desperately they need this equipment and with the help of the volunteers we can really make a dference to people who are treating those worst affected by coronavirus.” The shields have been gratefully received by NHS workers, who have been sharing their support for the campaign on social media.Helen Kilminster, a pharmacist from Worcestershire tweeted that when she received a call from DCrowdUK telling her that  shields have been dispatched to her, she “Actually cried. Happy tears. Relieved tears.” Toby Johnson, , is one of over  volunteers who have joined DCrowdUK. He is staying up overnight and giving up his Easter break to print the face shields at his home in Surrey. Toby said: “It’s been amazing to work virtually with like-minded people who all share the same goal using modern technology to help the NHS in this current time.” In Yorkshire, engineers from the University of Sheffield are also working around the clock to print and distribute the protective face shields. Dr Pete Mylon, the project leader from the University’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, said: “Doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers across the country are in need of PPE. Many staff are anxious about not having the right equipment and potentially exposing themselves to infection.” The coronavirus lockdown is a worrying time for millions across the UK. But itaposs also bringing out the best in people who are selflessly giving their time each day to help those most in need.

We will keep doing it until someone tells us to stop.” It isn’t just members of the public donating money to support the volunteers efforts across the country. The rd Holmesfield Scout Group in Dronfield, Sheffield donated acetate sheets to use as the disposable guard in the face shields.

The more stories she puts on her account, the more other children have so they are not bored.Rochelle said kids spend so much time online these days anyway, so itaposs good for them to be watching something useful.

I very much hope that the measures we put in place will allow us to do exactly as the OBR have said, bounce back.#xD He added: #xCYes it will be dficult in the short term.

Devastated Candice Blythe said she never imagined the final time she ever laid eyes on mum Anne, would be in the back of an ambulance as the doors closed. The mum-of-three had been surprised by daughters Candice and Louise, , for an early Motheraposs Day meal on March , but by the following week was showing early symptoms of the virus including a cough and fatigue. Despite initially appearing to get better, Anne, , was later rushed to hospital and after five days in Harlowaposs Princess Alexandra Hospital Anne took a turn for the worse.  On the morning of Friday, April , doctors were forced to increase her ventilator oxygen levels to  per cent - and by pm the same day, she had had died from multi-organ failure. Paying tribute to her much-loved aposbeautul and kindapos mum, Candice, who appeared on BBC Breakfast this morning, is now begging Brits to take the pandemic seriously. The credit controller said: You just donapost think itaposs going to hit you, and then it just comes along and throws you this massive, devastating curveball.  I never believed or thought for a moment that when the paramedics were shutting the door on me as I waved goodbye to my mum in the back of an ambulance it would be the last time I ever saw her. For the first five days in hospital her condition was stable and we were all feeling hopeful. But by Friday she had done a  turn, she was on the maximum amount of oxygen they could give her and the hospital staff were telling us there was nothing they could do to save her.  Every single one of her organs was failing. By pm that day she had died, thataposs all it took to ravage her body from the inside out - a matter of hours. I know people lose their parents eventually, but in normal circumstances you would be able to be at their bedside and say goodbye to them.  We didnapost get any of that and my mum was still so young. Our -year-old nan has outlived her own daughter, sheaposs absolutely beside herself. Candice lived at home with her mum to help care for her sister, Louise, who was left disabled by a brain tumour at  months old, and her mum, who had chronic back pain.  Anneaposs youngest daughter was prompted to call the ambulance when she went to check on her mum in the morning and found her lips were blue but her body was red, hot and blotchy, despite her complaining she felt cold. Even with those alarming symptoms, Candice said she wasnapost overly worried about Covid- as her mum was still her usual self - joking with the paramedics to aposget off her carpetsapos with their boots on.But concerned the -year-old could have coronavirus, the ambulance crew wouldnapost let Candice travel to hospital with her mum, and she was forced to leave Anne with just her mobile phone to keep in touch.Three days later tests confirmed she had the virus and although her condition remained stable, Anne had been moved to a ward where there was no phone signal and the family were instead given daily updates by medics. But after nearly a week of hopeful news her daughters received the devastating blow that their mum had been put on a ventilator and her organs were starting to shut down and she died just hours later. As well as her devastated daughters, the gran-of-two leaves behind her own mum, Vally, , and five siblings - prompting Candice to beg Brits to take the governmentaposs self-isolation advice seriously. Candice said: She was such a beautul, kind woman, everybody loved her and we were such a close family. We are absolutely broken.  We are so grateful to the hospital staff and we are still trying to find out who was with her in her last moments so we can thank them for not letting her go on her own. I just didnapost think this virus was going to get her, because she has been through and survived so much with her back and even survived a cervical cancer scare. We had plans to go to Vegas for her th next year and I still have all her Motheraposs Day cards up because I canapost bring myself to take them down.

For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here    Sadly their loved ones could not be with them, but grandson Elliot Howells praised the doctors and nurses who cared for them. Sadly, Pat died on Monday at am and her husband died later that day at pm. Elliot said: We are trying to take some comfort in the fact they died together, after  years of joyous marriage. Nanny, especially, was so well. We always said she was a very young -year-old, and she had decades left in her.  It is just horric and such a shock. Just over a week ago, I spoke to her and she was pressure washing her garden and painting her hallway. When she first started feeling ill she thought it was because she had overdone it a bit. Pat moved to Gelli as an evacuee from Birmingham during the Second World War when she was just a few months old. She never moved from south Wales, attending Hope Chapel in Gelli at the age of five in  and had been there ever since –  years – as the treasurer, deacon and caretaker.  She also worked as a lunchtime supervisor at Gelli School from  until a few years ago, having fought to continue working beyond retirement. Bryn worked as a financial advisor for Legal  General in his early years. But his pride and joy was being a le member of Treorchy Male Voice Choir, having joined as a first tenor in . In a moving tribute, Gareth Evans and Stewart Roberts, from the choir, said: Today is a very sad day as the Treorchy Male Choir mourn the passing of Bryn and Pat who have been a big part of our family for a very long time. They were a lovely couple who will be sadly missed. To the family, we offer our deepest sympathy and would like to thank Bryn and Pat for being part of our lives.  Elliot added: He travelled the world with the choir and made friendships and memories. He was so proud of being in the choir and to be at the helm of the family. The couple first met when Pat was , and Bryn was . They got engaged in  and married in Salem Chapel, Porth, on November , . They had four sons - Andrew, Barrie, Keith and Bleddyn - as well as two honorary daughters, Carolyn and Claire, who they had helped to look after from the age of six months,  grandchildren,  great-grandchildren, with another two on the way. Elliot says: Their home had an open door and their house was so full of love. They took such pride in their family and we loved celebrating their diamond anniversary just a few months ago. Nanny was elated to receive a card from the Queen. We are such a close family. Most of the family live within a short drive of their home. I live in London, but spoke to them every day and saw them every couple of weeks. It was heartbreaking that we couldnapost see them in hospital, but the healthcare staff and everyone at the hospital were brilliant.

Amy was handpicked to be the Duchessaposs assistant private secretary and accompanied her at official engagements and big events.

The -year-old went into Mater Hospital after contracting the killer bug and has now pleaded with other youngsters to take it seriously. The teen revealed the brutal symptoms which saw him rushed to hospital within  minutes after being tested during a routine check up.He told Dublin Live : I don’t know how I contracted it and don’t think half of the people who have it or had it will know where they have got it from. It’s a virus, you can’t see it.I got my first symptoms on Wednesday th March and went for a regular routine check-up in the hospital on the th.I had a cough and was very short of breath but I just thought it was my asthma acting up. I thought it was pollen in the air but my consultant heard me coughing and got me checked by a nurse. My blood pressure and o levels were high and within  minutes I was isolated on a ward.I couldn’t eat, I lost my appetite, I was finding it hard to breath and was very short of breath. I wasnapost in ICU though so I had no special machinery attached to me. I spent three days in isolation alone and another three days in a ward with two other men who also had COVID -. I was extremely nervous, I felt isolated from the world as nobody could come visit me or see me. Brandon said the staff at the Mater Hospital were phenomenal. He continued: The only people who could come in were nurses and doctors, it was a terrying experience. But the staff at the Mater Hospital treated me like one of their own children and comforted me when I needed them most.  They are phenomenal and the work they are doing is just incredible. In my opinion in  drop the Grammy awards and IFTA awards and every award show you can think of and award every frontline staff out there. Within a couple of days, Brandon was released from hospital with healthcare staff able to check up on him while he continued to isolate at home. He added: After my few days in hospital I was released home as I had my own bedroom and bathroom to isolate in and was given a pulse oximeter which connected to my mobile through Bluetooth. This allowed me to check my heart rate and oxygen levels which would send the results directly to the hospital to keep an eye on me.  Dark thoughts continued to run through Brandonaposs head for the duration of his time in the hospital as he battled the terrying virus. He added: When I first went into hospital, all sorts was running through my head. I thought about death, I thought I’d die alone without anyone by my side. But, I was one of the lucky patients, I got through it. I thought because I’m a teenager that I was untouchable that I would never get the virus, I thought it would never hit my doorstep. To the teenagers out there having sleepovers, cycling in groups, going to beaches and hanging out together, ask yourselves, is it worth it  Is it worth spreading the virus  You may be able to fight it but the people you spread it to like your grandparents or parents, will they  "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror more austerity would","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: More austerity would be a cruel slap in the faceThe tough times\" mentioned by Tory Chancellor Rishi Sunak must not prove to be tough for the key workers keeping the country running - nor for the poor, elderly or disabledShareByVoice of the Mirror:,  APR Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video rishi-sunak-says-economy-face-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news voice-mirror-more-austerity-would-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Then, Conservative austerity was a political choice which snuffed out a promising economic recovery, squeezed wages and sunk the NHS on to its knees.

Some have been entirely asymptomatic, meaning they show no signs of Covid-, but have tested positive, while others can experience symptoms ranging from mild to those which require emergency care.Many people who have experienced mild symptoms, including a fever, fatigue, dry cough, shortness of breath, and loss of taste and smell, but havenapost been tested may suspect they have already had coronavirus.The problem is the milder symptoms can mirror those experienced with more common illnesses, like a cold, making it dficult to diagnose. Dr William Hillmann, an associate inpatient physician director at Massachusetts General Hospital, explains that the only way to tellsomeone has already had coronavirus would be with an antibody test. It would allow experts to check blood samples for antibodies against the virus, but these are still being developed and are not yet in widespread clinical use.Dr Hillmann told: I, and I think many others, are anxiously awaiting for those to become available. He explains that even those who have had coronavirus with no symptoms are still contagious for a period of time, but aposwe just donapost know for how long at this pointapos. People who may believe they have coronavirus should act no dferently to those who donapost, for the safety of themselves and others around them. Dr Hillmann says: Since there’s no real way to know at this point who might have had it, unless you’re symptomatic, you get a swab and are definitively diagnosed with it, I would just act asyou hadn’t had it. Keep doing all of those things that we all should be doing at this point: social distancing and hand hygiene. Although those who have had coronavirus are expected to build an immunity to it, at least for a short period of time, at this point it still remains unclearthe same person can catch it twice.

The hospital took just five days to be completed by April . Stringent lockdown measures in China resulted in a decrease in the countryaposs overall infection rate but there are fears that asymptomatic patients and imported cases can still spread the virus. Suenhe has at least  imported Covid- cases out of nearly , confirmed and suspected cases among its , residents. More than  people in Suenhe have tested positive for coronavirus while showing no symptoms and more than half of Chinaaposs imported cases are recent arrivals from Russia. China Central Television Station reported that nine out of the  floors of the hospital will treated coronavirus patients with no symptoms. Hundreds of medical workers will be sent to the hospital from dferent parts of Heilongjiang and other provinces.Workers are aposfurther improvingapos the facility today, but the hospital can receive patients at any time from now, according to a separate report from the state broadcaster.Hundreds of medical workers will be sent to the hospital from all over Heilongjiang and other provinces and  experts from the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention under the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Preventionwill staff the hospial. According to the CDC, the hospital will carry out nucleic acid tests and other forms of research to aid in virus control and prevention this will allow Suenhe to test up to , people per day. The CDC experts have built a pressure-style tent as a temporary lab to do the testing, according to a senior Suenhe official.With the number of new cases dropping to zero in China but soaring abroad, the nation now views the virus as a aposforeignapos problem and has increased its efforts to screen new arrivals from abroad. Last week China closed all entry and exit points on its ,-kilometreborder with Russia to try and stop the virus spreading. Heilongjiang and neighbouring Inner Mongolia has much less travel than major cities like Beijing and Shanghai but it is a popular alternative route into the country. There are a high number of Chinese citizens who live and work in Russia due to major investments between Beijing and Moscow. National Health Commission expert Wang Bin said Monday at a news conference: We are facing a truly grave situation in the northeast as represented by Suenhe,. Up to now our medical resources in the area have just not been sufficient. All travellers arriving in Russia via Primorsky Krai and its regional capital Pogranichny must do a -day quarantine.  It has closed hotels to visitors and is requiring travellers to have a pass showing they do not have coronavirus. Russia closed its land border to travellers from China in January. While Wuhan, which is more than , kilometresaway and is believed to have been the epicentre of the virus , has lted its restrictions Heilongjiang Province went into full lockdown last week. Health officials in the remote city said there have been  new aposimported casesapos in the region and  were asymptomatic sufferers.

An email exchange that took place with one of the institution#s staff prior to our interview said that the -year-old embodied #everything that is good about the university#.That doesn#t even begin to cover it. Muriel, who has held numerous roles since first starting  years ago, is warm, friendly and funny. In fact, she#s the sort of person -year-oldme would have loved to have met on my first day at Edinburgh University eight years ago.Although she might not have been able to help me, she has given support to thousands of other students who have passed through the doors of Dundee University over the years.Excluding a -week period in  when Muriel retired # we#ll get to that in a bit # she has been a permanent fixture at the university. In October , she started as a clerical assistant at the faculty of science.At that time the department did #everything# as far as students were concerned, including dealing with inquiry and admissions letters. She stayed in the role until , before moving into a position working directly with postgraduate students.#I loved it,# she explains. #I really enjoyed all the work with overseas students.# Muriel witnessed plenty of changes in the years that followed postgraduate student numbers soared from around  in the early s to , at the turn of the century and new buildings sprung up around the campus.#We moved from Cross Row, onto the seventh floor of the Tower Building, before ending up at Airlie Place,# she says. The busiest time of the year was always that four-month period between June and October, as the team worked constantly to ensure the admissions process ran smoothly.#It was just mad during that time. I was working a lot of overtime, coming to work in the evenings and catching up but I thoroughly enjoyed it.#There were four of us working in the office at one point. We all worked brilliantly together and did each other favours. We still all keep in contact two of them are still at the university.#In  Muriel made the decision to retire, but only managed  weeks before ing to work # this time in a dferent role. She#d passed a remark to a colleague, around six months prior to her retirement, about an ambition to work on the university reception at one stage.#And then, after I was away for  weeks, I got a phone call one morning and he said to me #you once said that you would like to work in the reception. Well, we#re looking for someone now.# ##When can I start # I replied. He said to me, #I think you need to discuss that with your husband# and I said #oh there#ll be no discussion,# she tells me, laughing hysterically.I ask her why she retired in the first place. #I think I just needed a break,# she says.#They were wanting to expand things and change things and they probably felt #well that old soul won#t change.# I felt it was maybe time to hang up the reins and let someone  have an opportunity.# Now, Muriel works part-time from Monday to Friday and loves every second of it. #It#s good to meet people and I think that when you#re older, you need something like this,# she says.#This sitting around the house would drive me mad. We were off for two weeks over Christmas and on that weekend before ing to work, my husband asked me #what are you thinking about going back to work # I said #oh, I can#t wait.#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.31266726-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.31266726-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.31266726-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.31266726-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"a job for life loyalty to boots has kept mo in her dream role for 40 years","story":"For Maureen McCabe, working as a pharmacy delivery driver is pretty much a dream job. The -year-old recently celebrated  years service at Boots and can#t quite put her finger on what it is that has kept her at the company for so long.She thinks it#s a combination of factors from her love of driving and passion for working with prescriptions, to her friendships with colleagues and relationships with staff working in the surgeries and shops across the city.I ask Maureenshe remembers the date of when she first started working at Boots. It#s clear it is etched in her memory as she tells me without faltering: #January st . I started as a sales assistant in Lochee before moving onto the chemist counter, approximately two years later.#After that, Maureen transferred to the site#s store on Reform Street where she worked on the photo-lab and in the children#s department.Finally, she found her calling and took on the #cushy# van driver role. She#s now been doing that job for  years, and hasn#t looked back once.#I love my job. For some reason, I#ve always loved working with prescriptions picking them up from doctor surgeries and delivering them to stores across the city,# she says.#The thing about this job is you maintain great relationships with the surgeries and shops and you feel really close to all their members of staff.#I#m very loyal to Boots because they#ve treated me so well over the years. Plus, we all work as a team I#m always having a gossip with my colleagues. Instead of getting called Maureen, they call me Mo. There are only two people amongst the shops and surgeries that call me by my actual name. When I come back after a week#s holiday a lot of them say, #oh we#re glad to see you back Mo.# I just love it.#The Monieth resident, who works Monday to Friday from around am to pm, has always gone above and beyond in her role.#The customers used to come in and say #I want Maureen to serve me. She knows what I#m wanting.# I was that good with them. I#ve always had a brilliant rapport with them.#There have been a lot of change over the years, including managers and other things that I think should have just been kept the way they were, but you#ve got to move with the times you have to adapt.#We#re doing things like e-learning now which we never used to have to do. We#ve not been affected by the internet yet, but seemingly it#s coming. Some of the stores, such as the one on Reform Street, send their scripts away and get them back a couple of days later all packed up. So there are changes coming.#I don#t think there is a #hardest# part of my job. I#ve no worries when it comes to doing this role. I think it#s great you#re out-and-about, you#re your own boss.#It#s been a really good time for me, these last  years. I didn#t think I would last it myself, but I have.

This has been dficult to accept.“The SPFL board and executive freely admit that they focused on the sporting merit of the proposal and did not take into consideration any financial fall out to their member clubs.“Fundamentally, we believe that in these exceptional and uncertain times, no member club should be worse off as a result of this proposal than they are today.“The current proposal will see member clubs cumulatively have in the region of £.-£ million pounds of lost revenue.“Amongst the member clubs there have been numerous discussions of the SPFL’s offer as well as viable, equitable proposed alternatives that could see, potentially, a neutral outcome for all clubs involvedthe season cannot be finished.“In all cases, current placement monies could be distributed to the member clubs in very short order while maintaining all SPFL obligations.“Make no mistake we would have to work quickly and diligently to ensure that members’ current needs are met and that the democratic process is followed, but it is achievable.”An SPFL spokesperson added: “It is very important that clubs consider carefully the resolution and we are grateful to those clubs who have voted already.“With the Ladbrokes Premiership and Ladbrokes Leagues One and Two isions each having approved the resolution, we await the voting slip from the one Ladbrokes Championship club that has yet to vote.“We will provide an update as soon as we are in a position to do so.”The SPFL set an initial deadline of pm for clubs to vote.However it is understood league rules give members  days to vote on resolutions – and Dundee are keen to weigh up their options.It is believed Partick Thistle and Inverness Caley Thistle were the two Championship sides to vote against the plan.As a result, Dundee appear to be in a position to set whichever agenda they please in negotiations with the SPFL.🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

As any parent of an autistic child will know, sudden change in routine is absolutely horrendous. We were seeing meltdown after meltdown,# she said.#However, despite her struggles, Kaitlin has begun to settle into the new routine.#Le before coronavirus was dferent for our family anyway. We couldn#t go to theme parks, regular parks or spend days out in places where there were lots of people. Our lives were pretty unusual so, other than them not going to school or their karate class, it has been kind of normal le for us.#The full-time mum, who alongside her children is classed as being at #moderate risk# during the outbreak due to being diagnosed with coeliac disease, has already identied ways of ensuring the youngsters aren#t struggling with their change in routine.She said: #The thing I#ve found most important for them is enabling them to keep in contact with their friends. They game with them on the PlayStation, they Facetime them and they text them. I think, even though they can#t see their friends, keeping that social relationship there is incredibly important for their mental health.#They also participate in classes at Sports Karate East. Their instructor has been running online karate sessions through Zoom so they#re still doing that even though they#re in the house.#He#s been setting daily challenges for them, which could be something personal that they have to do, or could include their whole family.# vw, px\"  When the school closures were first announced, Lori was concerned that there would be a number of challenges she#d have to face.She said: #I was particularly concerned for Kaitlin because of her inability to cope with sudden change and the fact that I#d not be able to answer her questions about what was going on. She is thriving on homeschooling though.#On the other hand, the boys can#t handle doing work at home because it isn#t an educational setting, so they#re struggling to read things through or finish a task because it#s not normal for them.#Aiden and Jordon, being on medication, also usually go to CAMHS to have their weight, height and blood pressure checked as their medication can cause weight loss, stunt their growth and sometimes cause blood pressure issues.#So I’ve purchased everything I need to bring #CAMHS#  home. I take all their measurements and work with the service so that they can keep a record and noticeany issues arise.#I also know that we#d be stuck without my partner, Jay, who does the medication runs approximately once a month.#Lori has, however, been pleasantly surprised by some of the changes that lockdown has brought about.#I#m finding that the kids are spending more time together. My eldest has been playing with Kaitlin a bit more. With her, things have to go her way when it comes to playing so Aiden has been really thoughtful and focusing on doing stuff that makes her happy. It#s been quite amazing to see,# she said.#A lot of people are freaking out about the lockdown, but you have to look at the positives # you#ve got more time with your family.#Before, my schedule was so rushed with appointments. On a normal daily basis there#d be constant clashing, but the house has actually been more peaceful.#Sarah McIlravey, project manager at Dundee and Angus ADHD Support Group, said: #Living with ADHD in your family daily under #normal circumstances# can be dficult. The last three weeks under the current government restrictions have seen many families being pushed to the limit.#The sudden closure of schools meant that children and young people living with ADHD had their daily routine taken from them with little or no warning.#Many families are facing new challenges under the current restrictions. If private outdoor space is limited, then their child may not have the means to burn off their excess energy. There#s also a lack of routine, which can cause meltdowns. This is because some children and young people with ADHD lack the ability to be flexible and therefore go into a meltdown when there is a change to routine.#Many children and young people with ADHD have sensory processing issues. Sensory processing issues occur when the brain has dficulty in organising and responding to information that comes through the senses like taste.#This, for some children and young people, can lead to a restricted diet and in the current situation many families are finding that the range of foods that their child eats has become even more limited due to the closure of some shops and supply issues.#However, there are positives to being in lockdown with people who have ADHD. They love to help so give them a job and let them prove this to you. Children and young people with ADHD also have a good long-term memory and are good at observing the little details that many of us miss.#Throughout the lockdown, Dundee and Angus ADHD Support Group have been continuing to provide support and advice for their families.The group also have  Top Tips available to buy through their website, where you will also find useful links and information about ADHD.Charlene Tait, the Deputy CEO at Scottish Autism, said that the Covid- restrictions can be especially challenging for autistic people and their families.#While the sudden changes to a daily routine are proving extremely dficult for some autistic iniduals, others can really thrive when day to day social pressures are removed, including being at school, and they are able to structure their day in a way that better suits them,# she said.#The lockdown can also reduce the pressures of a normally busy schedule for many families, providing them with more quality time together to share the things they enjoy.“Our advice to autistic people and their families is to stay as calm as possible, be kind to yourself, try not to put yourself under excessive pressure.#Teachers will not be expecting parents to recreate school at home, indeed for some autistic children this blurring of the boundaries can be dficult.#Adjusting to a new routine may take time – we advise parents to try to make activities fun and go at a pace that suits everyone.#It’s important that the home remains a secure and positive environment for all the family at this time#Anyone looking for advice or support can contact the charity#s autism advisors, via their website."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.31266726-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.31266726-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.31266726-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.31266726-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"the feelgood feed stories to lift your day","story":"Things are tough right now — but the power of community has never been more important or more obvious.In every walk of le, people are coming together to ensure that no one is left to fight coronavirus alone.

There are a few families around the area as well as people visiting, and this gives them another space to visit.“A lot of the time it is dficult for them to go to woodlands or gardens, so for them to have the chance to do that is great. The garden is designed specically so wheelchairs can go in and can get round the sensory beds. vw, px\"  “The beds will be there to provide dferent types of scent, taste and texture.“It is a hectic modern world. Since I started my work volunteering, it’s been very therapeutic to me, and I hope it will be the same for other people who are in stressful situations.“To be able to do that for people in our village is wonderful.”Plans for a garden have been in place for many years after the land was set aside for community use in the s.Trees were purchased in the early s and were planted by members of the community, including pupils from Balmedie School, who named the site Magnicent Seven woods.In , the woods were handed over to Belhelvie Community Trust so the garden could be created.Since then, volunteers have been working on the garden – and it was due to be opened in June.Some finishing touches are still to be made and a social media appeal has been launched to encourage members of the community to come forward to help get the project over the line. vw, px\"  A post on the garden’s social media profiles reads: “Balmedie has been and continues to be a place iniduals, businesses, families and voluntary groups, neighbours and friends call home.“Knowing that our garden has been a place for people to connect is incredible.“The sensory garden is still a work in progress.“I hope those of you who have shown our garden some love will continue to visit or maybe even lend a hand.”Joni said: “Before lockdown, we were doing a weekly meet, which was open to everyone. It’s a good way for people to get involved and feel part of it.“There’s some nice history there, particularly with the primary school children who planted the woods in the s.“It really is a case of finishing what they started.“We absolutely can’t wait to open. Although we are trying to wait patiently, we are really excited as a whole team.“We are really proud of how the community has come together to make this happen.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The most-quoted line is a statement of Scottish independence.Mr Noble said the idea behind the forthcoming book, titled Conquered by No-one, was that  modern-day Scots would write about the  signatories to the Declaration.But Mr Noble himself is writing about two iniduals ndash William Ramsay, Earl of Dalhousie, and Malise IV, Earl of Strathearn.Authors of other chapters include Linklater ndash former editor of The Scotsman ndash and historian Murray Pittock.Mr Noble said: ldquoWhat I see as the underlying justication of this publication is to try to raise the profile of the Declaration of Arbroath as the most signicant document in Scottish history.Mr Noble said the -year-old document introduced the concept of government by consent to Scotland.ldquoI think thatrsquos the critical thing and why itrsquos the most important document in Scottish history, said Mr Noble.ldquoItrsquos recognised by the United States Senate as a contributing factor in the discussions that took place before the signing of the Declaration of Independence in  and itrsquos something that has had a status in the English-speaking world for quite a long time, but lost its traction in Scotland.Mr Noble said a recent survey of Scots found that around a third did not know much about the Declaration.The same poll revealed that many supporters of Scottish independence viewed the Battle of Bannockburn as more important, said Mr Noble.Asked for his own thoughts on Scottish independence, Mr Noble noted that he has lived in England for many years so would not be allowed to participate.Buthe were permitted, he would choose to remain in the United Kingdom, he said, albeit with the hope that a federal system would eventually emerge.Mr Noble said: ldquoI donrsquot think Scotland is going to stay as it is ndash I think decisions in the main should be made in Edinburgh but I believe in shared sovereignty and I think therersquos a value in being part of the UK.He added: ldquoIrsquom not yet persuaded that complete independence is in Scotlandrsquos interests but I certainly think we should be going a lot further in that direction than we are at the moment.Mr Noble is the chairman of the Royal Caledonian Trust, a charity that supports the education of Armed Forces children. He is immediate past president of the Caledonian Society of London.During his career as a teacher, he was headmaster of Bexley, London, which was then the largest school in the capital. When he was a schoolboy himself, he attended Peebles High School.Conquered By No One will be published later this month by Hammer  Mirror Books.

The documentrsquos most famous excerpt is a statement of Scottish independence.Mr Clark, who works at Hawick High School, has previously completed Scots translations of a number of popular books.The focus of his latest effort, however, was rather dferent in style to previous inspirations, which include Diary of a Wimpy Kid.It took Mr Clark and Ms Douglas around three months to convert the Declaration into our native language.Asked where his interest in Scots came from, Mr Clark said it was his move to the Borders  years ago which kick-started his love affair.ldquoI spoke Scots in Hamilton and so did my friends but I was under the impression it was just bad English ndash it was knocked out of you, said Mr Clark.ldquoBut then I came to the Borders and found that a lot of people not only spoke Scots, but spoke it without a social stigma.Reflecting on the Declaration, Mr Clark believes Scots have a strange relationship with the document.ldquoItrsquos funny that we have this text thatrsquos basically the birth certicate of the whole country, but therersquos not a lot of knowledge about it, said Mr Clark, going on to outline his views on its signicance.ldquoAt root, itrsquos a revolutionary document.

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio.

The place was an Aladdinrsquos cave of implements for cutting, sawing, pounding, impaling. If you owned a Texas ranch and had a yearning to renew the fences, everything yoursquod need is here. So tooyou had to exterminate rats or mice, wasps, beetles, or any other pest that was getting in your way. There was a corner devoted to horses, with enough combs, brushes and hoof-picks to tart them up for Ascot. And there were elixirs and ointments and dips not only for horses but for sheep, pigs and cattle.The store is well placed, beside an auction market. Hundreds of metal corrals encircle the trading hub of this historic mart, the first of its kind in Scotland. It was opened in  by a butcher whose we realised he could do better for himself, and persuaded him to go into the auctioning business.Early in the morning, several times a week, farmers pass our cottage, heading for the mart with lorries and trailers packed with cattle and sheep. A short while later they rattle back home empty. In the present lock-down they are almost the only traffic going by, and I picture all us villagers lting our heads from whatever wersquore doing to watch. Tractors are even more exciting. One went past four times in each direction the other Sunday ndash just turning my head made me feel wiped out.At this time of year, tractors are busy harrowing and fertilising, but the most important activity is lambing. Irsquove never understood why, at Easter, we celebrate with chocolate rabbits when it is newly arrived lambs we should be thinking of. Everywhere you look there are picture-book hillsides of grazing ewes, eating asat an all-day buffet, while their infants dance like popcorn all over the place.By March, lambing season is in full swing, and gravelly bleating is, for me, the sound of spring. As daffodils splash verges and woods with colour, lambs cavort with no thought for tomorrow . The other day, on my way home from a hardware store ndash we needed to repair our wood-burning stove ndash we passed a field whose corner had been fenced off to create a maternity ward. The midwersquos caravan was parked among them, presumably making the midnight sht a little less arduous. Two lambs, sitting as close as eggs in a box, stared at me with beady black eyes, so motionless they appeared not even to blink. At a few days old, they were brilliant white, asstraight out of the washing machine. Their mother, in contrast, was a mess. Her filthy fleece hung off her in shreds, like a catwalk model swaggering down the podium, her woolly cape worn so low off the shoulder it almost trips her up.For any ewe about to go into labour, seeing a new mother in such a ragged state can do nothing for their nerves. Nature is meant to take its course easily in the sheep pen, with none of the coaxing, hand-holding or pain relief humans generally need. And when it comes to the farmyard, most of the time thatrsquos how it works. But as anyone who read James Herriot as a youngster knows, things can quickly go wrong. When they do, it iniably requires middle-of-the-night trips to snow-bound barns, and armpit- gloves.Sheep, a vet once told me, are always finding new ways of dying. Whether during pregnancy and birth, or out on the summer hills, their capacity to self-destruct is impressive. I spare you the details over your quailsrsquo eggs and kedgeree. I spent a lot of time, once, talking to hill sheep farmers, shepherds and vets for a book I was writing. Studying a veterinary textbook on ruminants and their ailments, and the photos in particular, was the most effective diet I ever went on.It made me realise how stoical these creatures are, and how much we take them for granted. With our streets empty and silent, and the knowledge of a highly contagious disease on the loose, these eery times are reminiscent of the dreadful Foot and Mouth outbreak in . Back then, throughout East Lothian where I lived, and in Dumfries and Galloway, where friends were farmers, there was a deathly hush in the countryside. The sight of empty green slopes, where there should be flocks and herds, was a definition of abnormal. As was driving through disinfectant at the gates of every farm. Worst of all were Hieronymus Bosch landscapes of smoking pyres. To blot out the sight and smell, farmers closed windows and curtains.Until that calamity I had never fully appreciated how big a part farm animals play in my understanding and enjoyment of the country. Now that it is us who are under threat, the tables are turned. But for all the bucolic charm of seeing lambsrsquo tails whirling like windmills as they suckle, this season is becoming a headache for farmers. Until Covid-, their main worry was the impact Brexit would have on trade deals and the price of home-reared meat. All that seems far off right now. With some abattoirs and most international borders closing, the farm calendar of breeding, rearing and slaughtering is at grave risk of disruption in the coming months. Among the lessons this crisis might teach us is the value of locally grown produce, and the necessity of being as self-sufficient a country as possible.While we get through this unnerving situation, those of us who live within sight and sound of frolicking lambs, or who follow media-savvy shepherds online, are grateful.

What I want to show you is a way we can take advantage of these current habits, to make new habits. So, letrsquos take my example of drinking tea.While Irsquom waiting for my tea to brew, I can practice doing push ups. Over time doing push-ups will become a new habit attached on to my old habit of making tea.PracticeThe next point is, I would like you to think of these exercises as practice not training. In training itrsquos easy to get bogged down by sets and reps but these are not important for practice. In practice, we arenrsquot concentrating on how many reps we can do but rather on the movement itself.Practice is as much about increasing our own body awareness as it is about performing the exercise. Try and do these exercises slowly and with focus. Ask yourself questions like, where am I generating tension in my body now If yoursquore struggling to focus as the exercise is too easy or too hard, each video will show you some iations that you may find easier or harder.FormThe last point I want to talk about is Form.No-onersquos form is perfect when theyrsquore starting out with a new exercise. We all find it dficult doing something new, so donrsquot beat yourself up about it and more importantly donrsquot give up in frustration.Dficulty gives an opportunity to improve.In each of the videorsquos wersquoll give you some pointers to help improve your form. We need feedback in order to make adjustments to improve this form.

The internet means access to sophisticated online archives is only a mouse click away and there are scores of websites offering advice to those hoping to discover their inner Sherlock Holmes.It all makes genealogy ndash and historical research more generally ndash ideal for locked-down Scots seeking mental stimulation at home.The premises of institutions such as the National Library and National Records of Scotland might be shut but thatrsquos no barrier when information can be obtained instantly and from anywhere. Even more importantly, much of it is free.Researching your family treeThere has over the last two decades been an explosion in the range and richness of online content available to those looking to find out more about their ancestors. Public interest in family history has grown just as rapidly.The ScotlandsPeople Centre in Edinburgh , part of the National Records of Scotland, provides online access to births, marriages and deaths, as well as wills, census documents, Coats of Arms and valuation rolls.Fees are charged for viewing some items but, explains Iain Ferguson, Centre Manager, the entire operation has been designed to maximise speed and ease of use.ldquoInstead of the olden days when you had to come in, we now have digitised museum records, he says. ldquoYou just type in a name and year, and the system can search for it in an instant. And you have the opportunity to look up images of records.Of course, the online quest to trace a family tree doesnrsquot have to be limited to big national organisations.Independent websites can also offer a vital helping hand. FindMyPast , one of the largest and best known, gives armchair genealogists access to billions of records and its archive is expanding all the time. Late last year, it announced a new online collection spanning nearly five centuries of Dundee and Angus history. The materials provide names, dates, residences and occupations, as well as photographic documents of streets and people. Many are full colour scans from paper originals.Technology and a certain BBC TV show, says Mr Ferguson, have combined to turbo-charge the popularity of genealogy as a hobby ndash and therersquos no sign of a slowdown.ldquoI would say there has been growth in the number of people being interested in family history, certainly, particularly around ten years ago, when Who Do You Think You Are was on television, he adds.ldquoAnd, as time has progressed, more and more records have been put up by family history societies and so on. People are far more keen. They have a thirst for knowledge.Itrsquos good to talkWhile technology undoubtedly supports the task of discovering an ancestor or their involvement in a major historical event, theres no substitute for conversation with family when it comes to unearthing the most exciting clues.Grandparents, aunts, uncles and, of course, mum and dad should all be among the first ports of call. Even older siblings and cousins can helpelderly relatives have passed away. And video chat apps mean the coronavirus lockdown is no obstacle to enjoying quality, face-to-face contact.ldquoTalking to your family is hugely important, says Tahitia McCabe, Genealogical Studies Postgraduate Programme Course Director at the University of Strathclyde.ldquoItrsquos the way you get the juicy bits - the stories and all the interesting stuff. Genealogy is about bringing history, people and places to le.ldquoThe official records donrsquot tell you the lsquowhyrsquo. They can only really capture the interface with governments and organisations, all the formal things that happen in your le. But there are lots of things that happen that donrsquot get captured in a formal way.Moving the focus of genealogy beyond official records and on to real human relationships is crucial to its wider appeal, says Ms McCabe, adding that the number of people under  attending her courses is definitely ldquocreeping up.The broader pictureAn accurate record of inidual events is vital but so is context - and few institutions are better equipped to provide this than the National Library of Scotland .Its huge multi-media archiveis a gold mine for digital genealogists and historians of all ages, particularly those seeking information about ancestors caught up in the two world wars.Lists of officers enrolled in the army, navy and air force, and an extensive collection of black-and-white photographs from the Western Front, are available free of charge. Also on offer are clan histories, maps and a moving image archive containing footage from communities across the country.

Begin by writing down everything you know about your family ndash names, dates of birth, places of residence. Evenall you have are rough dates and more questions than answers, itrsquos a place to launch your project. Talk to your family ndash do this sooner rather than later. If elderly relatives have all passed away, try older siblings or cousins. Search official records. Generally, yoursquoll want to try and obtain birth, marriage and death information for your ancestors and anyone  on your tree that is of interest. Plus, finding them on available census records is of primary importance. Itrsquos best to start as close to the present as possible and work your way back. That way you can usually very facts with your memories and records, or by checking with other family members. Once you have built up your skills, keep going! You could get involved in new projects such as a transcription or indexing project in your spare time. This is a great way to expand skills in deciphering old handwriting.

Simple language, delivered calmly and directly, has the best chance of sinking in.Honesty, clarity, calmness and directness have never been more vital than now, as we try to take in the enormity of the coronavirus crisis and its consequences. And yet many of our leaders are showing themselves to be woefully, shamefully, sometimes even deliberately incapable of giving straight answers to some of the most fundamental questions.The public accepts that scientists and medics do not yet understand every facet and quirk of this virus. But there is simply no excuse for the disgraceful lack of honestly and clarity around many issues that politicians can control.If ever there was a time for politicians be direct with people, this is it. We do not want obsequiousness, we do not need the pill to be sugar-coated. Donrsquot patronise or insult us. Just tell it like it is, even when itrsquos bad. Especially when itsbad. Be honest when ministers get stuff wrong, or when they donrsquot know the answer to something.

After all, there is still no reliable death toll, no UK or Scottish stats that include care home and community deaths as well as those that took place in hospital. Grieving relatives are left to tell their stories on social media, devastated that their loved-onersquos death doesnrsquot seem to count, distressed at the lack of knowledge or discussion around care home guidelines.There is still no honest or plausible explanation for why so few coronavirus tests are taking place, or why tracing ndash which has helped Germany and South Korea keep deaths down ndash was abandoned so early on. It cannot be unrelated that no minister or official dares to explain why the death toll in the UK is on course to surpass that of Italy and Spain, despite having had more time to prepare. People in England are dying of Covid- at . times the rate of Ireland, which has a comparable number of ICU beds per head of population.Theses and explanations already exist, of course, but are not judged by politicians to be politically expedient or comfortable.

This chastising tone is an insult to us all, not least the dead and bereaved.Indeed, the defensive insults are starting to stack up. Over the weekend Ms Patelrsquos cabinet colleague Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, made the contemptuous suggestion that the continuing shortage of personal protective equipment at the frontline could be down to doctors and nurses over-using it.And while some sections of the media choose to focus unhealthy amounts of attention on one particularly well-known Covid- patient, offering a running commentary on his recovery complete with sudoku, texts from his girlfriend and the films he is watching from his hospital bed, it is left to others to highlight the far bigger tragedies already emerging from this crisis.As Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis pointed out in a blistering attack on the patronising and ldquomisleading language being used by some ministers during the crisis, we are not all in this together.

Most of the major pandemics of the last  years began in animal hosts, including the Spanish flu which jumped from birds to humans and HIV, which came from chimps.:Coronavirus in Scotland - Researchers explore impact of virus on bodySince Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, was pinpointed as a possible point of origin for coronavirus in late , it has since infected more than a million people across the globe.It has been suggested that pangolins ndash a scaly mammal that looks like an anteater ndash was a staging post for the virus before it spread to humans.But new research suggests bats are no more likely to pass on viruses to humans than other animals.The research, led by scientists at the University of Glasgow reveals that the risk of zoonotic viruses - diseases that spread from animals to infect humans - spreading to people is largely the same across erse groups of animals.The findings published to in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America suggest previous scientic thinking that certain animals pose a heightened risk of spreading viruses to humans may not be correct.The researchers say that the findings cast doubt on the idea that bats produce viruses with a \"heightened propensity\" to infect humans.Dr Daniel Streicker, senior research fellow at the Institute of Bioersity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine at the University of Glasgow, said: \"The recognition that several high-profile viruses originated from bats triggered tremendous interest in whether there was something special about their ecology or immune systems which makes their viruses disproportionately likely to infect humans.\"Our finding that the number of zoonoses that have emerged from bats is about what would be expected for any mammalian group of their size casts doubt on the idea that traits of bats produce viruses with a heightened propensity to infect humans.\"Dr Streicker added:\"To knowthere is anything special about bats, we now need to understand whether the bat viruses that do jump to humans cause more severe disease or spread better among humans than viruses from other animals, which is currently uncertain.\"The study, funded by Wellcome, The Royal Society and The Medical Research Council, found that the likelihood of a virus transmitting from animals to humans does not signicantly dfer across  dferent types of bird and mammal.Instead, scientists now believe that it is the characteristic traits of the viruses, rather than their animal hosts, that will be the more useful in predicting whether the virus will be transferred to humans.Dr Nardus Mollentze, research assistant at the universitys Centre for Virus Research, said: \"Although bats will and should remain a focus for viral reservoir research, as the likely origins of major zoonotic pathogens such as SARS-CoV- and Ebola viruses, our work shows that the proportion and number of zoonotic viruses in bats is not unusual compared to other mammalian groups.\"This means that ongoing efforts to identy potential future threats to human health by screening animals for undiscovered viruses will need to focus on a much wider range species than is currently the case.\"Our study also highlights the need to find new traits of viruses that can help us anticipate their zoonotic potential, since knowledge of the current reservoir was not helpful to predict whether a virus might infect humans - even when the reservoir is closely related to humans.\"A year-and-a-half before the current Covid- pandemic, Dr Streicker led a study that showed that machine learning algorithms could predict the natural host of a virus and might help prevent the spread of disease to humans.Identying the natural virus hosts early - which can help prevent the spread to humans - can take years of intensive field research and laboratory work.Those delays make it dficult to implement preventative measures, such as vaccinating animals or preventing contact between species.But he led a group of scientists that found that a new machine learning algorithm could accelerate this process.An algorithmic model accurately predicted the likely host for a broad spectrum of single-source RNA viruses - the viral group which jumps from animals to humans most often.The researchers were able to train machine learning algorithms to match the patterns within viral genomes to the animal they came from. When a virus jumps from a natural host to a human, it leaves a fingerprint from the animal or insect which can be traced back.Over  viruses were studied, and in over  per cent of cases the model correctly predicted the known natural host of the disease. In  per cent of cases, the tool determined whether or not the virus was transmitted by blood-sucking insects, and the type of insect was predicted correctly about  per cent of the time.The model also revealed new leads. Ebola was also thought to have come from bats, but when the team tested two of the four strains of the disease, they found strong evidence that these strains of the virus could also have originated in primates.The team were developing a web application to allow scientists across the globe to submit their virus sequences and recieve predictions for natural hosts and disease transmission routes within minutes.And late last year Dr Streicker was among a group of scientists who pioneered a new technique to help stop the spread of deadly rabies from infected bats to humans.The group glowing fluorescent gel to estimate the potential effectiveness of spreadable vaccines to control diseases in wild bats in South America.Rabies vaccines given to bats can be transferred from one bat to another - however how widely they were spread was not previously known.The fluorescent gel - called Rhodamine b - was applied to bats in three colonies in Peru, where it acted as a marker to simulate the bat-to-bat spread of an oral rabies vaccine.When the gel was ingested by bats that groomed each other, it led to fluorescence in the bats hair follicles, which was then monitored by fluorescent microscopic analysis of hair samples collected by the scientists.Where common vampire bats routinely feed on human blood, rabies is estimated to cause up to  deaths in eve-ry , people, while losses from livestock mortality exceed pound. million annually, disproportionately affecting impoverished, rural communities."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scottish-government-told-clarify-emergency-funding-artists","story":"Labour culture spokesperson Claire Baker has written to Finance Secretary Kate Forbes, appealing for clarity, after Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government has \"provided funding through Creative Scotland for artists and those in the creative sector\".Creative Scotland and Screen Scotland has announced a bridging bursary fund to support freelance creative professionals who have lost earnings due to the cancellation of work during the pandemic.

The name first appeared in  when Bartholomew prepared a map to accompany a report to the RSGS by the oceanographer Sir John Murray.The following year, Antarctica was clearly labelled on Bartholomewrsquos Handy Reference Atlas.In , while walking at North Berwick with Agnes Livingstone Bruce, the daughter of David Livingstone, Bartholomew mooted the idea of a Scottish geographical society.The suggestion was well received and a number of Scottish peers, scientists and businessmen stepped in to support the fledgling society.As honorary secretary of the RSGS, Bartholomew welcomed a succession of guest lecturers in the form of eminent explorers and scientists and worked tirelessly to ensure that Scotlandrsquos new geographical society grew in scope and stature.Bartholomew enjoyed close acquaintance with leading academics and travellers of the time, including Sir Ernest Shackleton, Dr William Bruce, HM Stanley, and Cecil Rhodes, and he worked with many of them to represent their discoveries in map form.He collaborated with Sir John Murray to produce the maps from the HMS Challenger expedition, and in the early s he worked with Murray again on a publication on the fresh-water lochs of Scotland.Bartholomewrsquos extraordinary achievements were recognised in  when he was invited to become Geographer and Cartographer to the King for Scotland.He died  years later, in Sintra, Portugal, on April , .To mark the th anniversary of his death, a three-day gathering had been planned in Edinburgh for more than of his direct descendants and cousins to celebrate his le and achievements.However, due to the coronavirus outbreak, this reunion has now been postponed until a date in April next year."},{"url":null,"title":"rules-waived-cannot-access-public-funds-snp-tell-patel","story":"In a letter to Priti Patel and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick, SNP MP Stuart McDonald called for more to be done to support those with no recourse to public fundsamid the coronavirus pandemic.:Coronavirus in Scotland: SNP MP defies party by using crisis to push independenceThose who are NRPF cannot claim certain benefits or receive housing from a local authority.The condition is enforced on those who are subject to certain conditions on their stay in the UK.While he welcomed some actions taken to help those who have NRPF, Mr McDonald said some people were being turned away from homeless support sevices, adding that rules should be suspended and funding sent to local authorities to coordinate support for those who need it.He wrote: ldquoInstead of leaving local authorities navigating complex questions about what support can be provided to whom, and using what funding source, a faster and more comprehensive response would simply be to suspend rules prohibiting recourse to public funds and to make direct financial provisions for local authorities to work with those who have NRPF.ldquoI would urge you to make such a change as a matter of urgency.ldquoSuch a change could make an immediate and signicant impact on the ground.He added: ldquoI appreciate that this runs against the tide of years of UK immigration and asylum policy, but exceptional times require exceptional measures, as Portugal has demonstrated.ldquoSaving lives must be the priority ndash it is as simple as that.In his letter, Mr McDonald also called for automatic support for new asylum arrivals deemed to be destitute or those recently denied asylum status who also found themselves without money.He also said there should be support for those in asylum accommodation whose benefits have stopped as well as ldquopublic health assessments of the accommodations.:Jackson Carlaw criticised for indyref comments amid Coronavirus pandemicHe urged Ms Patel to increase the levels of financial support in line with the uptick seen in other benefits as well as the suspension of the breach of conditions policy, which could see a personrsquos actions resulting in benefits being stopped.A UK Government spokesman said: ldquoThe Government is committed to supporting people through this crisis and nobody should find themselves destitute, with pound. billion allocated to local authorities to help the most vulnerable.ldquoMany of the other wide-ranging coronavirus measures we have put in place are not considered public funds and therefore are available to migrants with no recourse to public funds.ldquoThese range from protections for renters from evictions, a mortgage holiday for those who need it, support for the employed and the self-employed and for those on zero-hour contracts, and support for those who are vulnerable and need assistance with access to medication and shopping.

Indeed, we might expect almost all the rise to happen within the first month,\" explained the forecaster.It noted that the unemployment numbers could sht again due to uncertainty over whether Government interventions to cover salaries will be extended.Public sector net borrowing is also expected to increase by pound billion this year, compared with March forecasts, hitting poundbn, or  per cent of GDP.The OBR said: \"The sharp rise in borrowing this year largely reflects the impact of economic disruption on receipts [with smaller effects from policy measures like the business rates holidays] and policy measures that add to public spending [with smaller effects from higher unemployment.]\"Under the scenario the forecaster has examined, public sector net debt would also rise sharply, surpassing  per cent of GDP during the year but ends it at  per cent compared with previous estimates of  per cent.Forecasters at the OBR were keen to stress this was a single scenario where \"for now, we have not assumed the shock has lasting economic consequences\" and should not be taken as a sign of what Government policy was likely to be.Businesses are desperate for access to cash to stay afloat with only a small fraction of the money promised making it into the bank accounts of struggling companies.\"However, the longer the period of economic disruption lasts, the more likely it is that the economys future potential output will be scarred [thanks to business failures, cancelled investments and the unemployed becoming disconnected from the labour market].Mr Sunak, who is due to lead the daily Downing St briefing later this afternoon, commented on the OBR forecast, saying: ldquoFirstly, look, its clear this will have a very signicant impact on our economy and [like] common with economies around the world and its important that were honest about that.\"People should know that theres hardship ahead, declared Mr Sunak, emphasising how the Government would not be able to protect every job or business.ldquoThe second point, its clear that the report makes clear that the actions weve taken, unprecedented actions will help to mitigate the impact of the virus on our economy andwe hadnt done these things, it would mean that things were a lot worse, for example the impact on unemployment.\"And the last point to make, is its clear we must defeat this virus as quickly as possible.

We have called for urgent action in relation to the loans scheme in particular, as take-up is worryingly low.Ian Blackford for the SNP said the analysis demonstrated the huge damage coronavirus was doing to the economy and the urgent need for the UK Government to fix the serious gaps in financial support for the millions of people who had lost their jobs or seen their incomes reduced.\"Too many people have been left out of the current schemes and millions are struggling to pay their bills and support their families when their incomes have been slashed.The party leader at Westminster said ensuring the right support was crucial but also warned the UK Government against any rash decision to lt the lockdown too early.ldquoProtecting lives must be the priority, declared Mr Blackford. ldquoThe lockdown must be in place for as long as is necessary to ensure people do not lose their lives needlessly.He added: ldquoThese figures also show the need for the UK Government to take bold action to ensure a strong recovery and build a fairer society.

However, it is important that the Scottish Government explains what consideration has been given to these proposals and the rationale for adopting a dferent approach.“I have therefore written to the Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman and First Minister asking for that clarication. I have also sought confirmation as to whether the Scientic Advisory Committee has been asked for its comments on Dr Pollock’s proposals. If not, I certainly hope that this will now happen.“As soon as I have received a response from Ms Freeman, I will share this widely with constituents. Now more than ever, it is essential that there is as much transparency as possible and that government is clear about the basis for the decisions it is taking”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If someone is threatened by cattle, they are encouraged to release your dog and take the shortest route out of the field. As always pick up and remove all waste. A government spokesman said: #This is a temporary situation and it is more important now than ever to maintain good relationships between neighbours and within communities. This is not about restricting the general right of responsible non-motorised access to land but it is part of the wider approach to prevent COVID- deaths and preserving the nation’s food supplies.#Exercising access rights responsibly means respecting the needs of other people, and you will need to adapt your behaviour accordingly in the national effort to contain the spread of COVID-. Land managers should respect access rights, which are particularly important at this dficult time.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in . I hope that recording will make its way into Tobar an Dualchais one day.I met Willie Matheson just the once long ago – Allan insisted I come with him to the hospital where Willie was in a wheelchair, frail but with bright eyes and a welcome smile.

This additional funding for the Northern Ireland Executive delivers on that promise by bolstering support for our fantastic public services and their staff - making sure they have the resources they need to meet the exceptional challenges presented by this outbreak, he said.We are united in our commitment to tackling coronavirus and working closely with the Northern Ireland Executive as part of our UK-wide effort to fund urgent health priorities at this very challenging time.Making the announcement, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, paid tribute to staff who would benefit from the additional funds.Our public services and its incredible staff are bravely working with immense resolve and skill to keep us safe. We depend on them, which is why we#re giving them the extra funds, tools and resources they need to tackle the virus, he said.From the start, I#ve been clear our vital public services will get whatever they need to protect this country and its people from coronavirus. We are delivering on our pledge.At the Budget on March , the Chancellor initially set aside a £bn fund as a rapid response, and said that whatever extra resources needed by the NHS and public services would be provided.News of the extra funding comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson continued his recovery from Covid- at Chequers in Buckinghamshire after doctors ordered him to rest.The latest analysis from Johns Hopkins University in the US suggested the UK#s case fatality rate, the number of deaths per  confirmed cases, was .%, behind only Italy#s rate of .%.The Ministry of Defence said nearly  members of the armed forces are now being loaned to five NHS ambulance trusts in England to support their work during the pandemic.But the Fire Brigade#s Union warned that nearly , fire and rescue staff are in self-isolation and unable to work.The Government also continued to face pressure over shortages of personal protective equipment for frontline NHS staff, as a growing number of health workers died.The Royal College of Nurses issued new guidance that nurses who could not get adequate PPE should, as a last resort, refuse to work.Speaking on Monday, Dominic Raab, still standing in for the Prime Minister, said: We understand the importance of getting PPE to the front line whether it#s in care homes or the NHS.I think the strongest practical reassurance they will want and that we can give them is that over the Bank Holiday weekend over  million items were delivered and we are straining every sinew to roll them out even further and even faster.Further afield, Spain, which on Sunday reported its lowest daily growth in infections for three weeks, allowed workers toto factories and construction sites.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We should not be clutching at inaccurate straws as to the reason on death rates, said Dr Donnelly.It#s like looking at a car speedometer. If it#s faulty, do we go by what it reads and say that we are right We will find out more about the figures next week when this really hits. Only then should we be looking more closely at the statistics.There are inaccuracies built into the reporting of statistics. Who#s to say how many deaths there have been in the community in each country  Speculation isn#t helpful unless all the facts are laid out before us, and right now that#s not something we can say with any accuracy.There are dferences in reporting between countries.Pointing fingers now, saying this or that would have made a dference, is not something we can realistically do with any certainty at this point.If we look at a country like Canada, it has a relatively small death rate through coronavirus, but it#s essentially a very rural country where the population is spread across widely, similar to Ireland. But we still can#t say for certainthat is a factor. There will be plenty of time afterwards to analyse curves and death rates.It may well suit a government to be putting out the idea that they#re staying on top of this.And when it comes to the timing of school closures, we still don#t know for certainthat had any real benefit. Was it wise to send children home to grandparents and familyit turns out they were carriers of the virus without displaying symptoms There is far too much guesswork about it all at the minute for anyone to be making assertions on which was, or was not the right course of action.I have stated before that the people, the epidemiology , the health systems and the mechanisms of death certication are all dferent, making meaningful comparisons dficult, like comparing apples and oranges to bananas.On her Twitter thread which attracted thousands of responses, Elaine Doyle laid out which she said were the dferences in approach between Ireland and the UK governments to managing the Covid- spread.So you have two English-speaking countries, with close cultural and historical associations, both with underfunded health systems, and comparable levels of ICU bedsgoing into the pandemic.But England has more than . times the deaths  Why  she asked.But wait, it#s worse! Becauseyou compare the per capita death rate between Ireland and England, rather than the UK as a whole, England has almost . times the number of deaths as Ireland .As of Saturday, April , there have been . deaths per , people in Ireland.There have been . deaths per , people in the UK.Ms Doyle was also critical of testing rates across the UK.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It comes after Carrickfergus PSNI removed a post from their Facebook page that said exercise begins and ends at your front door. The issue was highlighted on BBC Radio Ulster#s Nolan Show on Tuesday morning. Due to the personal commentary of the officer which did not reflect the PSNI#s communications approach in relation to Covid- the post was removed, a PSNI spokesperson told the Nolan Show.

The Health ProtectionRegulations introduced by the Northern Ireland Assembly states that no person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse.One of the reasonable excuses listed in the legislation is to take exercise either alone or with other members of their household. The legislation makes no reference to where exactly the exercise should be carried out. PSNI advice states that people can leave home to exercise, for example, a run, walk or cycle - alone or with members of your household. However, police do not list exercise as among the reasons people are allowed to travel. Reasons to travel include work when you cannot work from home, volunteering and charitable purposes and to access critical public services.

Police issued a statement on exercising away from the home last Thursday.The legislation is already clear-cut. The new health care regulations allow you to leave home and travel onlyis necessary, a PSNI spokesperson said.Driving to go for exercise is not a necessity and is entirely in contradiction of the advice of the Chief Medical Officer and the Health Service who want you to stay at home to protect the Health Service and save lives. It is the assessment of the Police Service that it is also a breach of the restrictions.The spokesperson said that there was no reason for people to travel for exercise. Simply, the restrictions require you to have a reasonable excuse to have a need to leave home, it’s not just a reason, but a need and I see no need for anybody to drive miles in order to take their daily exercise so that would put you in breach of the restrictions, the spokesperson said.

The initiative is the brainchild of Kelly’s Eurospar, which has stores in Raacuteth Moacuter and Hatfield, and is supported by the Lynch’s Spar in Skeogh. Henderson’s Eurospar in Rossdowney, Glassagh Taxis and Creggan Enterprises. Adrian Kelly said it he felt it was the ‘very least’ the community could do given the sacrices the nurses were making. “The nurses are serving on the frontline, spending Easter in isolation away from their families,” he said. “A friend of mine askedwe might possibly help make things a little more bearable for them with a hamper of treats to acknowledge our appreciation. And the other Spar stores all thought it was an excellent idea – and signed up immediately. We are delighted to be doing it.” googletag.cmd.push The stores have assembled  hampers – each containing Easter eggs, chocolates treats, snacks and a bottle of Cava - for the nurses who are staying in the Holiday Inn. The first of the deliveries, organised by local volunteers, will be leaving Raacuteth Moacuter at .pm tomorrow . Last month, Eurospar teamed up with Creggan Enterprises and Glassagh Taxis to launch a free delivery service for older and vulnerable customers who are unable to do their own shopping because of the virus. Raacuteth Moacuter’s Conal McFeely said the community response to the Covid crisis in Derry had been very strong. googletag.cmd.push “Our nurses’ courage and dedication at this worrying time has been steadfast and vital,” he said. “It is inspiring to see initiatives like this which recognise and salute the contribution being made by those on the frontline our behalf. “Let us hope that it is not long before our nurses are able tosafely to their loved ones to enjoy some much needed family time for themselves.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases.

Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of these symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as us or hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Kieran Stevenson was man of the match in their win over Antrim and Michael McMullan spoke with the Derry keeper, as he rekindled the memories of their golden era.  For  years, Derry had wandered around in Ulsters hurling wilderness. Until that moment. The  Ulster final was ticking towards a conclusion. Mickey Collins won a free which his brother Ollie drove between the posts at the Andersonstown Road end. Derry fans among the , strong Casement Park attendance exploded into another frenzy, as their caman-wielding heroes hit the front again. googletag.cmd.push Was this eventually going to be their day  Not just yet. There was time for Antrim to cast the dice one last time. Gary OKane composed himself over a stoppage time sideline cut. The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally. The following year, he was second choice behind Padraig Oacute Mianaacutein when Derry won the All-Ireland B championship. googletag.cmd.push In , the Us lost to Antrimin the Ulster final. From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker. Promotion at the end of  began a four-year stint in the top flight. They ran Waterford to seven points at Ballinascreen in their first outing, before facing Cork and Kilkenny. The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels. Every successful team needs a marquee man in their full-forward line, McGuigan is Slaughtneil’s. RELATED - Michael McMullans team of the decade- Click here...

Twenty years ago this year, Derry pushed Offaly every step of the way and won the respect of a nation. The former Oak Leaf defender spoke to Michael McMullan….  Its your job to enhance the legacy so when you finish playing you have tothe jersey to a better place than what you got it in. - Dan Carter Dan Carters words are both romantic and sincere, painting a picture of a career that ended with the Webb Ellis Cup in his clutches. googletag.cmd.push Not everybody gets the perfect send off. Some stay too long and others dont achieve, both leaving a sense of regret. Niall Mullan is one of the lucky ones. The Kevin Lynchs man, from a family steeped in hurling, saw his -year senior career with Derry come to a conclusion under the spine-tingling, rapturous applause of a standing ovation at Croke Park. The Oakleafers, after winning Ulster for the first time in  years, pushed Offaly to the brink. The electrying realisation that – barring Offalys fans – the entire stadium was willing them on, allowed Derry to play with real purpose. googletag.cmd.push But it was Offaly who found enough to win the game. Boy did they earn it. They did benefit from Ollie Collins Achilles injury after  minutes. It was a huge loss to Derry who, in the final analysis, had no answer to Johnny Dooley. The Seir Kieran man had his snipers vision finely tuned and contributed  points. It was enough for the  champions. Niall Mullans final chapter in the red and white of Derry came in the most gallant of defeats. The rest of Ireland were forced to stand up and take notice. One of his opponents that day certainly did. Joe Dooley entered the fray after  minutes. Seconds later a sliotar flashed across his path. Goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson was always grateful for the positional sense of his defence. “They always seemed to know where the ball would land,” he said of Mullan, Collie McGurk and Conor Murray in front of him. For once, Mullan admits to having lost his bearings and Joe Dooley got a right introduction. “I took a wild swing rather than trying to catch it,” Mullan recalls. Without taking control of the ball he, lashed on it and his hurl broke across Dooley. It was all part of the battle for supremacy. No quarter was asked and none was given, with the duo swapping jerseys at the final whistle. The competitive respect we all drool over. As Mullan said farewell to inter-county hurling, he walked down the dressing room tunnel with Dooleys jersey in his grasp. “Its still my pride and joy,” he said. *** Sport was never going to be far away from Niall Mullans le. His father John, better known as Ginge, played both football and hurling. He gave plenty back in . He was Chairman of the football club and, until the recent lock-down, has been taking Irish language classes at Kevin Lynch Park. Sadly, his mother Anne passed away in recent years. Niall has two sisters, Anne and Maria and has three brothers John A, Hugh Pearse and Eoin, who have all been involved in the GAA. After his underage club career, he continued to represent St Canices and Kevin Lynchs with distinction. Its thought he has two senior football medals and won five titles with the hurlers. At the time of our interview, Mullan is unsure. For someone who has achieved so much, the silverware is over-rated. “I dont know, I am not joking,” came Mullans response to how many county titles he had amassed. “I got a thing for my thbirthday from one of my brothers. My medals are up on the wall, but I wouldnt even count them.” Mullan holds the memories closer to his heart. “The people who were foes then, that are good friends now. The likes of Declan Cassidy and Collie McGurk. There was Conor Murray too, who was playing on the Derry hurling team from the start.” Thats what he takes from it. Since making his debut when he was  or , Mullan was pretty much an ever-present in Derrys defence until calling it a day at the age of . “I think there was one of the years, I didnt go to the hurling as I was in the football . Hinpheystropped speaking to me because of it,” he laughs. Hinphey arrived in Dungiven from Kilkenny, along with the input of Laveys Tom Magill, left an unquantiable imprint on the hurling landscape of the county. With the big ball, Mullan won two MacRory Cups with St Patricks Maghera and was on Derrys All-Ireland minor winning team of . He played U football for the county and was on the  for the  senior final defeat by Monaghan, but missed out on the Ulster title in . In hurling, under the guidance of Joe McGurk, he was midfield on the first team from the school to land the Mageean Cup, .  Niall Mullan in action against St Louis Ballymena in the  Mageean Cup final “An experienced hurler, Nialls calmness and nerve rubbed off on the other players of lesser experience,” read an extract from the  school magazine, the Patrician. “His long-range pointing was an invaluable asset to the team.” The team was captained by McGurks brother Johnny and included future All-Ireland senior football winners Henry and Seamus Downey, who was the teams goalkeeper. Enda Gormley and Damian Cassidy, not from hurling clubs were on the team. Cassidy was the competitions top scorer and bagged - in the final against St Louis Ballymena at Bellaghy. For Mullan, the experienced hurler, he was only starting. *** It all began miles away from  and what it represented. Derry hurling had made a habit of languishing in Division Three, when Mullan joined during the mid-s. He is the only player to have played in all four isions of the league. He recalls how they would always lose as many games as they won. But it began to gradually change. Block by block, the building process began. In , after winning the All-Ireland B championship, Derry went to play New York in Gaelic Park. It was the era of Hugo McOscar and Pat Joe McKennas management. After arriving a day late and having to play in a searing  degrees heat in a dust bowl, they got slaughtered in the game, Mullan remembers. “After that, we had four or five days as a get together, as a team, and we enjoyed ourselves. On the flight home, I remember Declan Cassidy and a few of us talking,” he added. “We had grown close as a group, we knew the hurlers were there. We were talking that we could do a wee bit with this group.” The following year, Derry won promotion to Division Two and went on to contest the  and  Ulster senior finals. Mullan remembers ex-Down manager Sean McGuinness telling them how close they were getting. To make the final push they would need to be playing top level hurling in the league. A win over Wicklow, in Portlaoise, saw Derry promoted to Division One as champions. “Before we went into theUlster championship, we played Kerry in a play-off match in Parnell Park and we beat them well to stay up,” Mullan recalls of their first season dining with the big boys. “It gave us a lot of confidence. We played well that day andwe had played like that in some of the other games, we couldve beaten one of the bigger teams. “I remember playing Wexford, up in Slaughtneil, and it was a dirty, wet day. We held them for a long time and they pulled away in the second half with the wind.” A lot had a changed since theirfrom New York. Collie McGurk had committed solely to hurling and Kieran McKeeversto the hurling  in , rubber-stamped its attraction. Before that, players just came and went. There was no continuity. Now it was dferent. “You ask the likes of Co McEldowney, or anyone playing at that time, it was really enjoyable to play and we had plenty of craic on the way home on the bus. You could just see everybody that was there...wanted to be there.” Away from the fun, there was also an appetite for work. Manager Kevin McNaughton had enlisted fitness coach Malcolm McCausland. No longer was it running laps til you boked. “He would take us up to do sprints and he gave us a programme of what to do ourselves,” Mullan points out. Going into the Ulster final, Derry were perfectly poised. They had ran Antrim to three points two years previously, had a strong league campaign under their belt and were convincing semi-final winners over Down. Their win over Antrim in the final was all the more notable, with the absence of Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever due to suspension. “Emmett was captain and he never missed a night of training right through and he never got his suspension lted...he just drove the thing on another notch. “Kevin was the manager, but Tomdid a lot of the training,” Mullan reveals. With an Ulster title in the bag, the duo ramped up the preparations even more. “Training wouldve involved a lot of shorter games...they had everything speeded up and closed in. The training matches were faster, there was no time - you just got the ball and got it away. “I remember that everybodys hurling was good at that time and you got used to the speed the big boys played at, thats what they concentrated on.” It was time to take their hurling to the biggest stage of all. *** Adrian Logan was deployed to Derry to get a taste of the new hurling revolution and arrived at Younger Homes in Maghera. It was the week of the new Ulster champions baptism against All-Ireland contenders Offaly in the Croker cauldron and Niall Mullan was the interviewee. “I remember telling him that theyknew absolutely nothing about us and we knew who they were. I thought that was an advantage and we were going to throw the kitchen sink at them.” Derry travelled south the day before the game and stayed out of Dublin. Everything was relaxed. During the week, the squad were flying at training. The scene was set. Sitting in the dressing room, Niall Mullan was conscious it could be his last game with the famous Oakleaf badge on his chest. “Collie McGurk was , Conor Murray was  and I was ,” Mullan now jokes. “So thats over  combined years, so there were no speed merchants.” As the team togged out, Mullan noticed the usual nerves werent present. He was taking it all in his stride. “I was walking about...thinking Ill beoff after  minutes or I will play well. Thats just how I felt.” “Collie would always talk in the changing room and he was telling us lets get wired into these b******s, there would always be some of the players chipping in.” From the win over Antrim, the management had some reshuffling to do. Declan Cassidy was on his honeymoon and missed the game. Mickey Conway dropped back from midfield to plug the vacancy at wing back. Ronan McCloskey reverted to midfield and Geoffrey McGonigle ed to the attack after his suspension. Derry took to Offaly with every sinew they could offer. “Ten minutes into the first half, your lungs were bursting because Offaly were going at a pace we werent used to, but they never pulled away from us,” said Mullan of his memory from the game. By half-time, some of Offalys key players hadnt scored. John Troy got little change out of Colin McEldowney before being replaced by Joe Errity and the towering Gary Hannfy was brought closer to midfield. “Cowas brilliant and then they brought out a big boyon to him and Co was only up to his waist, just swinging away...he had a brilliant game that day.” Derry lost Ollie Collins to injury and Johnny Dooley began to exert an interference on the game. And still Derry kept coming back. A second McGonigle goal was followed by a Mickey Collins point to level matters, - to -. “I remember the hairs standing on the back of my neck. Everybody in Croke Park was roaring for us. You could hear the atmosphere building because we were so close to them. You were going on adrenaline and we did think we could beat them.” The story didnt have a total fairytale ending. A second Brendan Murphy goal helped Offaly crawl past Derrys tectonic efforts. But after  years of hurling, Niall Mullan bowed out at the top. Like Dan Carter, Nelly left a legacy and Derry hurling was in a much better place.

Declan Cassidy was on his honeymoon and missed the game. Mickey Conway dropped back from midfield to plug the vacancy at wing back. Ronan McCloskey reverted to midfield and Geoffrey McGonigle ed to the attack after his suspension. Derry took to Offaly with every sinew they could offer. “Ten minutes into the first half, your lungs were bursting because Offaly were going at a pace we werent used to, but they never pulled away from us,” said Mullan of his memory from the game. By half-time, some of Offalys key players hadnt scored. John Troy got little change out of Colin McEldowney before being replaced by Joe Errity and the towering Gary Hannfy was brought closer to midfield. “Cowas brilliant and then they brought out a big boyon to him and Co was only up to his waist, just swinging away...he had a brilliant game that day.” Derry lost Ollie Collins to injury and Johnny Dooley began to exert an interference on the game. And still Derry kept coming back. A second McGonigle goal was followed by a Mickey Collins point to level matters, - to -. “I remember the hairs standing on the back of my neck. Everybody in Croke Park was roaring for us. You could hear the atmosphere building because we were so close to them. You were going on adrenaline and we did think we could beat them.” The story didnt have a total fairytale ending. A second Brendan Murphy goal helped Offaly crawl past Derrys tectonic efforts. But after  years of hurling, Niall Mullan bowed out at the top. Like Dan Carter, Nelly left a legacy and Derry hurling was in a much better place.

The visit was arranged in co-operation with Derry City and Strabane District Council. Bishop McKeown said he hoped the Easter Blessing would bring some comfort to grieving families across the Derry Diocese who are unable to visit the graves of their loved ones.

No matter where you go or who you are talking to up and down the country, they always ask about Roly. There is always someone who knows him or has played with or against him.The above paragraph was taken word for word from Drumaness Millsrsquos th anniversary booklet in . It captures brilliantly the essence of Roly lsquoThe Manrsquo.Roly died on Wednesday, March , sparking a deluge of tributes on social media. True gentleman, one in a million, what a lovely man, one and only Roly, top man, a legend mdash these tributes, among many others, appeared again and again.Roly was an integral part of village le in Drumaness, dandering to the bookies or the shop. He would make multiple stops to say hello to everyone he met, discussing the issues of the day.I have known him for a!most  years. He worked in Sam Bellrsquos egg factory across the road from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar. The workers would kick a ball about the road during their break and even to my untrained eye he was dferent class. It was my introduction to Roly lsquoThe Footballerrsquo.Some years later Roly and his brother, John, knocked on our door in Crossgar. They wanted me to play for the Mills in the Newcastle Summer League and I was more than happy to do so.Playing with Roly was a great education for a young player. He made football look easy, was stylish and talented, possessing the rare gt of keeping the game simple.Small wonder then that when talk comes around to the Millsrsquo greatest ever player, Roly is always in the conversation, despite competition from the likes of Robbie Strain, Osie Gelston, Conor Walsh and Davy Mills.Legend has it that in those days boys were born with boots on in Drumaness because this was a village where sport was king. So it was that Roly also excelled at billiards and cricket, reaching a very high standard in both.But football and the Mills were Rolyrsquos first loves and he rarely missed training or matches. Inevitably his talent came to the notice of Irish League managers and he enjoyed spells with Portadown and Cltonville in the early seventies. Nevertheless, Roly was a home bird and sooner or later he would pull on the Mills shirt again.By now I was playing for the all conquering Downpatrick Rec team of that era and we pitched up to a Border Cup final early in  to play the Mills. We had just won the Steel and Sons Cup and had our eyes firmly on the double, but Roly and Osie Gelston had other plans and proceeded to inspire the Mills to a famous - win.Roly had reached the twilight years of a glorious footballing career, but there was still time to lead the Mills reserves to another giant-killing act, beating Castlewellan in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final in .After such a stellar playing career, Roly was expected to become a manager. He did dip his toes in the managerial waters once or twice, but with no offence intended to the managerial fraternity mdash myself included mdash Roly was probably too nice to be a manager. In all the years I have known him I canrsquot remember him raising his voice. He was just so easy going, decent and level-headed.As a result people liked Roly and this popularity unsurprisingly proved to be an asset in his working le. After Sam Bells he spent a number of years working in the Co-Op shop in Drumaness before taking up employment with well-known butcher Vincy Doran.He was a familiar sight in Vincyrsquos van, delivering to hotels and restaurants, but it was his weekend door-to-door run which played to his strengths and further cemented his popularity.He became known as Butch or Butcher mdash a nickname he loved mdash and Vincy to this day has nothing but good things to say about Rolyrsquos eight-year stint with him.Rolyrsquos next stop was with Jimmy Quinn, who owned a bakery in Downpatrick. Jimmy shrewdly ed Roly to the door-to-door market and with people still finding it dficult to say no to the personable Roly, their successful liaison continued for  years.Jimmy likes nothing better than relating Roly stories,none of which can be repeated here, and like the rest of us he will remember Roly with the utmost fondness.Unfortunately Roly wasnrsquot immune to the ups and downs of le and deteriorating health curtailed his working le. He managed to fight and beat prostrate cancer a number of years ago, but this time around the lsquoBig Crsquo has claimed this lovely man.Ironically it was during these latter years that he seemed to be ever present on the streets of Drumaness, allowing him to befriend a generation entirely unaware of his past sporting prowess.Roly married Betty Rice on October , , and together they brought Noel, Pauline, Betty, Carol and Christine into the world. After almost  years together as a couple they remained best friends, as well as husband and we.Apart from my football connection to Roly, I have been his neighbour for  years and since his passing I have heard him described as lsquoMr Drumaness Millsrsquo, but for me he was Mr Drumaness full stop. This village will never be the same without him.Rolyrsquos family should be immensely proud of his impact on those who knew him and how sad it was to see coronavirus rob them and Roly of the fitting send-off he deserved.However, the good news is that I know there are plans afoot to have a celebration of his le when normality s. Nobody deserves it more. RIP Roly.Roly Hanna -.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Cormac.jpg","title":"Ardglass golfer on teeing up with the best in the world  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin could be forgiven for feeling understandably frustrated right now.The richly talented  year-old should be locking horns with some of the worldrsquos best players on the European tour.But instead of prowling the fairways hersquos holed up in his apartment in Dublin mdash like many others undergoing coronavirus lockdown.Itrsquos not how Sharvin, currently th in golfrsquos world rankings, thought his first season on the European Tour would go.Having secured his card for the  season by finishing th on the  Challenge Tour rankings, he was gearing up for a potential breakthrough campaign on the top circuit.However, after just four events, he is unsure of what the future holds as the sporting world goes into shutdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.He clearly appreciated that golf, and sport in general, is of minor importance when compared with the COVID pandemic.Of the decision to close all golf courses north and south of the border, he told the BBC recently: ldquoItrsquos a precaution that needs to be in place.I donrsquot know enough about the virus, but theyrsquore obviously trying to slow things down. Hopefully wersquoll be back playing as soon as possible, I think thatrsquos the goal.ldquoI think we just have to accept it and sit tight and when it does pass, we can get things moving a bit quicker.Certainly things have happened fairly quickly for Sharvin in his career to date. He only took up golf seriously relatively late in his teenage years, but went on to have glittering amateur career.In  he was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, contributing three points and remaining unbeaten in a .-. thumping of the United States.Sharvin turned  the following year and joined the ranks of the European Challenge Tour.Having missed his European Tour card by a single shot in , Sharvin relocated to Dublin and It proved to be the right move.He amassed eight top ten finishes in  starts to earn a rookie season on the European Tour thanks in large part to his six top fives.Sharvin only missed four cuts, two of which came in the first two events of the season, before he kickstarted his campaign with back-to-back top ten finishes.However, his best performance came at the Irish Open at Lahinch where he finished tied for th and was also the leading Irish golfer.He showed impressive consistency during the  season and proved his elite-level credentials with a tie for th finish at the Irish Open, ending the week as the leading home competitor.He says: I had a really good year, I put myself into contention a lot which was great. I think I was ready to take that step and I think the way I played, I deserved to get my card in the end with a few good results.ldquoI also managed to play well in a couple of European Tour events as well which showed me that I was ready to take that step. Therersquos a relief that I have my card now but itrsquos only the start of it mdash I know I have to keep improving and moving up the rankings.At the Irish Open he finished ahead of future Open champion Shane Lowry, Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood former world number one Lee Westwood and Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington.ldquoIt was disappointing to shoot level-par on Sunday, but I feel like I didnrsquot do much wrong, he said.ldquoIt was really nice to have that pressure of going into the final round of a big European Tour event with a chance to win. It showed me where I was mentally and physically, that I was able to come from the Challenge Tour and compete in a top-level European Tour event.ldquoThat was an unbelievable week. The crowds were incredible and I attracted a big following being the leading Irishman, and that was a great feeling.ldquoItrsquos a nice feeling when hundreds of people are following you and everyone is willing your ball into the hole. I think that really geared me up quite a lot. It was a class buzz.ldquoIt was dficult going back to playing the Challenge Tour in the middle of nowhere in France the week after, but that week gave me the confidence to string together more good results to get off the Challenge Tour.Sharvin admits itrsquos been a slow start on the European Tour, with a tie for th in the Oman Open his bestin four starts this year, but his belief in being able to compete at the higher end of leaderboards remains undimmed.ldquoI feel like my game is good, but I havenrsquot really put all the facets together. ldquoI think in Oman I was second in strokes, gained tee-to-green and just putted really poorly. I played quite nicely in Qatar and just didnrsquot get it going.ldquoItrsquos obviously such a short period of time so itrsquos hard to assess in four events, but I feel like Irsquom close. This break may help me improve other things and hopefully Irsquom a better player when we start again.Given his Walker Cup experience, Sharvin would dearly love to play in the Ryder Cup in the years ahead.ldquoThe Ryder Cup would definitely be up there for me. I grew up playing team sports and have been involved with them my whole le, so that would be huge.ldquoI feel like Irsquom pretty good in a team and having tasted a little success in team sports, I think thatI can get my game to that level, Irsquod be a good asset in that sense..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch singer performs at nursing homes  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH man is serenading residents in local nursing and residential homes through the COVID- crisis with hit songs to remind them of happier times.The gesture from popular singer Wayne Rodgers is even more laudable as he lost all his work overnight in the lockdown as a driving instructor and a wedding band performer.The  year-old performed outside four homes on Monday, delighting the residents and carers in Redburn Nursing Home, Oakridge Care Home, Spa Nursing Home and Fishbourne House Care Home.Performing classic hits from artists such as Jim Reeves and Clf Richards, Wayne believes his singing is helping strike a chord with the elderly residents who need to be kept apart from family members at this time.ldquoThe singing helps the residents and it really helps me too as it passes the time for me as my work has had to stop due to the virus, said Wayne, who now lives in Bellaghy.ldquoIrsquove received photographs taken from the inside of the home showing residents enjoying my songs and itrsquos lovely to see. It can get really emotional as there are now family members turning up to wave and talk to their relatives through windows while I sing.ldquoItrsquos heartfelt to see their enjoyment at being able to connect with their parents or grandparents inside. It can be heart-breaking at times but itrsquos still nice to see it.ldquoI have been told by some of the carers that they have seen some patients with dementia sing along to the music and thatrsquos also really good to know.A former soloist with St Patrickrsquos Church in Ballynahinch and ex-pupil of St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College, Wayne ensures he keeps the residents and carers safe at all times.A long extension power lead from the home is laid for him before he arrives so he can plug in his mixing desk, microphone and laptop.Wayne said: ldquoItrsquos sterilised before I get it and when I had it back itrsquos sterilised again so I have no direct contact with anyone in the home.ldquoI try not to sing beyond  minutes as the homes often open the windows to allow residents to hear better and Irsquom conscious of not wanting anyone to get too cold in the process.Wayne started off singing at a Magherafelt nursing home when a pub owner hersquos friendly with was approached by the home asking for suggestions at how they could entertain the residents.He added: ldquoThe residents in the home loved it and asked me to come back again so I did and then I got calls from other homes.He now has nine performances under his belt with the help of his brother-in-law, former Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin, and his sister, Michelle, who runs Paddy Kellyrsquos Bar in Ballynahinch.Wayne, whose parents Maurice and Naveen still live in Ballynahinch, has been a show band singer for years and once performed with the legendary Sunshine.Gigs for his wedding band, The All Stars, have been cancelled or postponed as couples were force to rebook their wedding dates.Wayne is performing free of charge and says he is happy to as it gives him some focus in his le at this time.ldquoI donrsquot have much  to do as work has stopped, but I do feel a lot better knowing that Irsquom bringing some happiness to others, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Binmen.jpg","title":"Binmen receiving thank you messages for essential work  ","story":"THE districtrsquos binmen have been thanked for continuing to provide collection services during the coronavirus pandemic.Some people have been pasting messages on their bins thanking the men for the job they are doing, while their efforts have also been commended by Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Working in extremely dficult circumstances, the binmen are providing a critical service at this time and their efforts have not gone unnoticed by ratepayers who taking time to wipe the handles of their bins with disinfectant before they are collected to help keep refuse staff safe.Householders are also being reminded to ensure that they continue to place the correct waste in the right bin to help ease the burden on public health services to help stop additional risks to staff who are working under increasing pressure.Refuse collection staff have been singled out for particular praise as they collect and transport waste, with their work also helping to protect the environment.Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots said the materials refuse staff collect for processing such as cardboard, plastic and glass are vital resources in package production across the food and retail sectors, explaining that ain recycling could impact on the supply chain ing effectively.He added: ldquoAll those working in the waste sector are key workers and I have also established a COVID- Waste Group to provide support, guidance and regulatory direction to the waste sector.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which recently closed all its household recycling centres to redeploy staff to work in refuse collection mdash said that all bin collections continue as normal.However, residents are asked to provide additional help by ensuring that bins are put out for collection no later than am every morning or the night before.Where possible, residents are asked not to restrict bin lorry access and park as considerately as possible. Over recent weeks, binmen have experienced issues accessing homes in a number of areas including Ballynahinch and Newcastle to collect bins.Residents are also asked to ensure that all bin handles are cleaned or wiped-down before and after use and not to approach refuse staff without following the minimum two-metre social distancing guidance.Commending refuse staff for the work they are doing in dficult circumstances, the council chairman explained that as the coronavirus crisis unfolded, the local authority was quick to implement a number of health and safety measures to protect staff.He explained that the measures allowed bin collection teams to continue the service with minimal disruptions to residents.ldquoCrews now operate staggered start times between .am and am and are authorised to leave work immediately upon the completion of their rounds, said Cllr Casey.ldquoTo support social distancing, crews are restricted to one driver and one loader in each cab.

It is certainly a strange experience for me.I was ordained in  in Downpatrick. New technologies and new means of communication came after that, and Irsquove struggled ever since. So the recent experience of having to install web-cams at short notice into the three churches in my two parishes of Portaferry and Ballygalget, has been somewhat traumatic.This week is the holiest of weeks for Christians. The passion and death of Jesus is commemorated, in preparation for the resurrection on Easter Sunday. We celebrate this in ious ways. We might well ask ourselves what happened to Lent and how on earth do we celebrate what will seem like a lsquovirtualrsquo Easter Coronavirus suddenly intruded into our Lent, at close quarters, and changed everything.My mother still remembers the glow in the sky over Belfast, when from her home in Ballykinlar, she heard the planes over South Down on their way to blitz Belfast. No doubt her grandmother would have told stories of the terrible pandemic of Spanish Influenza just over a century ago.But my generation and that of my nieces and nephews have known little of such things and we experience this pandemic a grave threat.At the moment of writing, the streets of Portaferry and Downpatrick are entirely empty, as are the great cities of Rome, London and New York.The unexpected severity of lockdown leaves us feeling bewildered, disorientated, shell-shocked. We are acutely aware of the suffering around us mdash illness, hospitalisation, loneliness in sudden isolation. As schools close we are anxious about increased tension in family le. The loss of our work and leisure patterns, financial and employment worries.In the Old Testament Jobloses so much of what he had mdash health, family, possessions and friends mdash yet he refuses to rebel against God in his suffering. This is incredibly dficult for most of us. His attitude of acceptance of his suffering can be of help to us. He says: ldquoShall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not take the bad Jobrsquos story can be useful to us at present. If you can get a chance, read it.Lent mdash an old English word for spring mdash is more challenging this year than we ever expected. As we celebrate Holy Week here are two words that figure in the writings of Henri Nouwen, a Dutch spiritual writer, that I find useful.The first word is security. Where do we look in our lives for security. A basic human need  In success, popularity, money, friends, family, insurance and so on  We mightnrsquot think we do. We will always be influenced by them, but deep down they will never provide us with security.Many of those things are good in themselves, but spiritually, the only true security will be found in the everlasting love of the One who loved us first and who wishes to love us into and for all eternity. Job understood that mdash security.The second word is patience. Patience means a kind of ldquosuffering through the present. Itrsquos from the Latin, patior, which means to suffer. But being patient does not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It is not being passive. Having patience is not easy for us. How do we wait patiently for God this Holy Week, Easter and beyond during this world pandemic Being patient is an active waiting mdash it means a certain experience of suffering through the present moment. To let the seeds of our suffering be sown in the ground so as to grow later into healthy, strong plants.It means avoiding the dead-end of what could have been for the ability to pay attention to what is happening before our very eyes, paying attention to the people and world around us. By that patience, we can begin to catch a glimpse of the first rays of Godrsquos glorious coming.Last week, I personally saw those first rays when I witnessed the staff in a residential nursing home in Portaferry decide to live-in with the residents for as long as this emergency would last.This week I witnessed those first rays when a cousin, a retired doctor, rang me to tell me he was volunteering toto work to bolster the Health Service.In one way or another have we not all been privileged to witness the generosity of spirit, despite danger, of those carers, nurses, doctors, medics, ancillary staff and many others Might this not be for us another glimpse that helps us experience in our present circumstances that Christ is indeed risen and lives now among us  It certainly is a glimpse for me.The Old Testament reading for many of us on Sunday last was from Ezekiel. ldquoThe Lord says this: I am going to open your graves. I mean to raise you from your graves and lead you back to the soil of Israel. I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and will know that I, the Lord, have said and done this it is the Lord who speaks.The people of Ezekielrsquos time knew their frailty and experienced uncertainty as we do today. Their faith in God had been severely shaken. Could they start again Security, patience, maybe these two words might stay with us over the next while as the reason for the hope that we have I leave you with the words of a psalm, which St Patrick himself echoed in his own writings, his lsquoConfessionrsquo.The words encourage us to place our hope in the Son of God who will sustain and strengthen us in our days, the Son of God, Jesus, who knew what it was like to stumble and fall beneath the weight of the Cross. With these words I ask God to bless us and keep us safe:ldquoI waited, I waited for the Lord and He stooped down to me, He heard my cry. He drew me from the deadly pit, from the miry clay. He set my foot upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.With security and patience we can put our trust in the fallen saviour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Huge.jpg","title":"Huge boost for foodbanks  ","story":"THE districtrsquos foodbanks have been provided with a pound, boost by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them respond to increasing need during the coronavirus pandemic.The funding has been provided via the local authorityrsquos community network and is one of a series of initiatives the local authority is spearheading to continue providing a range of frontline services and responding to the needs of the vulnerable and elderly in particular.This week, residents across the district have been thanked for adhering to advice to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors and keeping safe.And, as the Easter weekend approaches, council chief executive Marie Ward has appealed to people to continue to listen to the advice to stay at home and save lives.

","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm, a new report has revealed.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computermodelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.There is also the Phennick Cove marina located behind a breakwater mdash which could be extended mdash to the west of the main harbour which can accommodate up to  leisure craft and the inner harbour which dries out at low tide.The consultants say that the inner harbour is particularly useful for vessel maintenance but not utilised as extensively as the outer harbour due to limited water depth.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.The report suggests deepening the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.In addition, consideration is being given to creating a pontoon with so-called finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.Removal of the existing slipway at the southern end of the harbour adjacent to the beach is suggested as it is not generally used and considered too deep for access, with potential issues in relation to the removal of an area know as Church Rock to be investigated.Quay reclamation work is suggested between the north west corner of the existing finger pier at the ice plant and north western tip of the fish market quay.This would feature a new piled quay, backfilled and surfaced with a heavy duty concrete. Extending theof the quay wall by  metres is also suggested.The estimated cost of the harbour dredging is in the region of pound, with piling work and the new quay line and reclamation work estimated at poundm and poundm respectively.The breakwater extension is estimated at pound.m with the new pontoon facility estimated at pound,.The consultantsrsquo report makes it clear that the costings include primary construction elements but does not include licensing fees, site investigation, engineering design and tendering costs.Before anything happens, a marine licence is required for specic site investigation work, rock quality design and testing, sediment sampling of overburden, contamination testing and an environmental impact assessment.The regeneration jigsaw also requires detailed design work and planning approval ahead of tendering and construction.An economic appraisal may also be required.News of the proposed investment at Ardglass harbour comes after the portrsquos importance to the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted during a recent meeting with Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots.He met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the harbour, with the politicians also highlighting the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure.They described Ardglass harbour as ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fishing fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed at the port.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran say further investment is ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand to provide an economic boost, not only for the village but the wider area, and create new jobs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Mourning.jpg","title":"Please stay in  ","story":"ldquoHE was my superman ndash the moving words from Loughinisland woman Maria Farrell whose father sadly lost his battle with COVID-.As her sister also lies in hospital fighting the virus, the mother-of-two has bravely spoken out to warn others not to be complacent about the deadly disease.Maria, who buried her father on Sunday, warned: ldquoIf you think you are exempt from this or you are immune to COVID-, you are barking up the wrong tree.ldquoMy dad went really quickly, hersquos tackled prostate cancer, heart attacks, falls, you name ithellip and hersquos bounced back.

He also highlighted the need for financial support for the southern relief road scheme in Newry.ldquoI fully understand that the roads minister has a lot on her plate and recognise that she is not responsible for the failure of her department to invest in any major road scheme in the local area over the past number of decades, he continued. ldquoThe bypass should be in place by now. Itrsquos potential for Ballynahinch and the wider South Down economy is immense.ldquoThe multi-million pound road scheme can rid Ballynahinch of its traffic nightmare, help rejuvenate the town and encourage more visitors into the district and wider Mournes area.South Down MP Chris Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  when hewas roads minister in a previous Executive.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the by-pass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

I have been transported to a time that has changed my perception of le forever.People with CF have a faulty gene which means the mucus in their bodies is much thicker and stickier than in other people.They donrsquot catch viruses more easily than other people but when they do, it affects their lungs by causing inflammation and increasing the amount of the sticky mucus. This makes bacterial chest infections more likely, some of which are resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in lungwhich is the leading cause of death in people with CF.As parents, for the first sixth months of Lorcaacutenrsquos le we were consumed with the fear. We were advised not to visit baby groups, not to let people with colds into the house, not to take him to the supermarket on a weekend when it was busy, not to let him play in soil, wet sand, or day-old playdough as well as taking many, many more precautions to keep him safe.We also discovered that my mother-in-lawrsquos COPD and my fatherrsquos bronchiectasis meant that Lorcaacuten would always have to be careful around his beloved Nana and Grandad in case he caught an infection from them. For the same reason, he could never be within six feet of someone  with CF because of the risk of cross infection. My world would never mdash could never mdash be the same.We rarely left the house. I gave up my job in the RSPB and postponed my studies. Much of our time was taken up with the heavy burden of treatment for CF, including daily physiotherapy and antibiotics. I spent a lot of time campaigning for a cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, to be made available on the NHS.And I cried a lot.Over the last three years, le has become more lsquonormalrsquo but beneath the joy of every milestone has been the fear of taking risks that could shorten Lorcaacutenrsquos le at any time.During this time we have learnt that there are some risks you need to take in order to be happy. Lorcaacuten began pre-school as well as swimming, gymnastics, and football classes and I resumed my studies and began working a few hours a week.There has been a lot of stress and sleepless nights, a lot of handwashing, and a lot of happiness. With the support of the public we won the campaign for Orkambi, a drug which can slow the decline in lungby up to % and can be taken by around half of people with CF. Lorcaacuten started taking it at the end of last December mdash the champagne was popped and finally we thought we could start to relax a little.Sadly it wasnrsquot for long. During the wait for Orkambi, Lorcaacutenrsquos lungs had become damaged, after catching a couple of colds in March, he ended up in the wonderful Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children for  days of IV antibiotics to treat a long standing chest infection.During those  days I watched the horrying news that COVID- was spreading. I grew ever more disturbed at the lack of action by the UK Government. How could our amazing health service, stripped bare by  years of austerity and cuts, possibly hold up under the strain of COVID- Lorcaacuten was moved to a room further away from other patients, masks appeared and I watched the eyes of the incredible staff in the hospital become more and more tense.With nearly every death I read that the patient was either elderly or had an underlying health condition. But why did that make it OK: Surely that made it worse  The message seemed to be that lsquoonlyrsquo the vulnerable were at risk but other peoplersquos lsquoonlyrsquo is my everything.As the days in hospital passed, I learned that the lung conditions of my son, mother-in-law, and father put them among the , in NI on the extremely vulnerable list. They would need to lsquoshieldrsquo for the next  weeks. Shielding means not leaving the house at all and having to rely on the government and the goodness of others to deliver medication and food to your door.When Lorcaacuten was able to leave the hospital, we arrived home mdash with great relief mdash to a lockdown. Once again, with no job to go to and my studies on hold, I am transported to those months of isolation three years ago.This time, however, it is dferent, because this time I have hope. For us, this too shall pass. We willto the normality so hard won in our lives. We, unlike so many others who will lose their lives, will have this as a memory to pass on. I let so much of Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy be marred by fear that I just canrsquot let it happen now. Every day I am thankful for my good fortune in a desperately unfair world. I am thankful for all the frontline workers and volunteers, for the Executive finally working together for the common good to sustain us and to protect the most vulnerable in society, for the kindness of people delivering food and medication to those most at risk.I am grateful to the other souls sitting in their homes feeling helpless and feeling like le is passing them by. But by feeling helpless we are helping more people have a le toto after this all ends.It will end but the world will never mdash can never mdash be the same and none of us will look at it in the same way either.Maybe it will be a world in which those who need support will begin to get it, a world in which our NHS will finally be built up rather than worn down, a world we protect rather than profit from. As I watch Lorcaacuten run happily and healthily around our safe home with his little sister, Saorla, I donrsquot feel fear for him. I feel fear for those putting their lives at risk for all of us, for those who will lose their lives and loved ones, and for those who are sitting in their homes feeling afraid.I often think that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but for the moment doing otherwise is a risk too great to take, for us all. If you can, embrace the cotton wool,only for a while..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Workload.jpg","title":"Workload up for Good Morning Down staff  ","story":"THE Good Morning Down charity which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district has increased the number of calls it makes as the coronavirus takes hold.Volunteers who work for highly acclaimed charity mdash now in its th year mdash have relocated from the organisationrsquos base at the Down Business Park in Downpatrick to their homes to ensure that the friendly voices people have come to rely on continue to be heard.Good Morning Down has also confirmed that in addition to increasing the number of calls that it makes, it has moved some people off the servicersquos waiting list in order that they can receive a call at this worrying time.Since it launch in , Good Morning Down has supported over  people with a wide range of disabilities and needs and the service it provides to people who live alone has never been more important.While there is concern among the senior citizens they contact and who have been advised to remain in doors for the foreseeable future, there is also great stoicism, with several able to recall hardships that they had to endure during World War Two.Staffed by  volunteers, the charity normally makes around  calls between Monday and Friday but the number has increased to help reassure elderly and vulnerable people that they are not alone.Relocating staff away from their main hub at Innovation House, the charity is unable to pick up any messages that may be left on the Good Morning Down answering machine. To help overcome this a new mobile telephone number is available mdash  .Good Morning Down was established to help reduce loneliness and isolation. Volunteers also signpost those who need further support to other agencies.Good Morningrsquos Down service has never been more important. One of the charityrsquos volunteers, Aidan Harris, says the current climate represents a challenge for everyone, particularly those who live alone.ldquoThe staff moved out of our base at the business park over two weeks ago, but we are providing the service from our own homes and what we are doing is very much appreciated by those we contact every week, he explained.ldquoWe certainly are living in unprecedented times none of us have ever experienced anything like this in our letimes and hopefully will never do again.Aidan explained that while a lot of information people need to hear is circulated via social media, many elderly people do not have access to it. In the main, he said they are relying on the television and radio.ldquoWe are letting them know what is happening and reinforcing the message to stay indoors and not let anyone into their home, even their own relatives. We are highlighting the importance of them doing all that they can not to catch the virus, the charity volunteer continued.ldquoPeople are very concerned at what is going on and many of those whom we contact used to get out to attend ious clubs but they have all closed due to the pandemic which means the elderly and vulnerable are spending even longer alone in their homes.Aidan also revealed that some who normally received only one call a week are now getting several more, with people brought off the waiting list so they can be contacted.He also revealed that the charity is also providing the people they contact with details about local shops which are providing a delivery service.ldquoWe are emphasising the hand hygiene message as much as we can and reminding people to stay indoors. We are also telling them to exercise social distancing and not let anyone into their homes, he said.ldquoWe are also telling those whom we contact not even to let one of their neighbours over the door as it is simply too risky. The people whom we contact are very concerned about what is going on but they are made of stern stuff.Aidan added: ldquoAll the volunteers are working hard to make sure we maintain contact with our clients, more regularly than in the past by increasing the number of calls we make to them.ldquoThe reward is how grateful they are for the service we provide and our main goal is do all we can to let them know that we are here for them and want them to keep safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11254009.jpg","title":"hairdressers beauticians raise funds ppe","story":"It is a tough time for our entire community and especially the business community.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
