Pictured: An Aston Martin DBS SuperleggeraThe 107-year-old group is pinning any hopes of a recovery on the performance of its £158,000 SUV, the DBX, launched in November.  Stroll, who owns F1 team Racing Point, made his $2.6bn (£2bn) fortune through investing in fashion houses such as Tommy Hilfiger and Michael Kors. As well as his base in Geneva, he has homes in London, Quebec and on the Caribbean island of Mustique, according to the Telegraph. He collects vintage Ferraris and more recently has taken an increasing role in the high-octane world of motor sport. In December rumours surfaced that Stroll, whose son Lance is a Formula 1 driver, would take a stake in the famous brand.    Aston Martin chair Penny Hughes said: \u0027The difficult trading performance in 2019 resulted in severe pressure on liquidity which has left the Company with no alternative but to seek substantial additional equity financing. Without this the balance sheet is not robust enough to support the operations of the group.\u0027Notwithstanding recent weak trading, the strength of the Aston Martin brand and our expanding portfolio of cars has allowed us to attract a strong new partner in Mr. Stroll to support the turnaround of the business.\u0027    Stroll is set to join the company\u0027s board as executive chairman, replacing Hughes, as part of the deal.He said their investment \u0027underpins the company\u0027s financial security and ensures it will be operating from a position of financial strength.\u0027Andy Palmer, Aston Martin president and group chief executive, said the past year had been \u0027regrettably disappointing\u0027 and said the fundraising was necessary to support the long-term future of the company.            Stroll is set to join the company\u0027s board as executive chairman, replacing Hughes, as part of the deal          Stroll made his $2.6bn (£2bn) fortune through a series of investments in the global expansion of fashion brandsMarkets.com analyst Neil Wilson questioned whether Stroll\u0027s £55million short-term cash injection will be enough to prop up Aston Martin.\u0027It will do a lot to alleviate immediate cash flow concerns – not least the fact that earlier this month it reported net debt and leverage ranges of £875m-£885m and 6.2-6.8x respectively,\u0027 he said.\u0027However, Aston could well have to go cap in hand to investors again if the sales of its DBX don\u0027t take off.\u0027\u0027Planned launches of electric vehicles are going to be delayed – they will require a lot of investment and it risks falling behind peers in this space at a critical juncture of EV take-off.\u0027         Aston Martin has been in talks to secure funding by selling a chunk of the business to a strategic investor for several months "},{"url":null,"title":"Footage shows J Lo Shakira rehearsing Super Bowl halftime show","story":"Share this article          In an interview earlier this week Lopez and Shakira said it meant a lot to them to have a double Latina lineup in the majority Spanish-speaking MiamiDespite usually raking in millions from their stadium shows, neither performer will be getting a direct paycheck for Sunday\u0027s performance.The NFL revealed in 2016 that it only covers costs for artists performing the Super Bowl halftime show – though those costs can exceed $10 million.But the performance is likely to lead to a huge windfall for the two singers regardless. Maroon 5, who fronted the show last year, saw a 488 percent jump in record sales, and Missy Elliott raked in a 282 percent increase after her 2015 performance.Companies will also be lining up to shell out around $5 million for a 30-second commercial during one of America\u0027s biggest sporting events.The NFL was forced to scramble for a big name act last year after multiple artists including Rihanna reportedly refused offers to play amid controversy over quarterback Colin Kaepernick still not having a job in the NFL in fallout for kneeling during the national anthem in protest of police brutality and racism.This year, the league hired Jay-Z and his company, Roc Nation, as its \u0027live music entertainment strategist\u0027 to arrange the much-anticipated halftime lineup.  "},{"url":null,"title":"SAS advertises women reservists time","story":"Share this article Applicants of both sexes must be able to pass the same tough tests, including a controversial eight-mile march carrying rucksacks weighing 22kg (48lb).Former SAS reservist and author Andy McNab backed the move to advertise and added he was \u0027all for\u0027 women joining the Special Forces as long as they can pass the relevant tests.But former SAS officer Colonel Tim Collins said: \u0027This is... the Army attempting to be popular.               Former SAS reservist and author Andy McNab (left) backed the move to advertise and added he was \u0027all for\u0027 women joining, but Colonel Tim Collins (right) branded it \u0027pointless\u0027\u0027The point is, it\u0027s pointless.

Everyone knew he messaged his \u0027favourite\u0027 girls. But it was dismissed as \u0027just Mr Belfield\u0027 and we were told to ignore it. He has so much power, nobody wanted to rock the boat.\u0027People were scared of losing their place at the school.\u0027I\u0027ve had nightmares about Mr Belfield and my mental health has got worse since I left school in May. He has messed with my head so much. Even if what he has done doesn\u0027t meet the criminal threshold, it is a massive breach of trust. I feel so let down by the council of manage-ment, everyone at the school.On one occasion, Belfield told Cat she would make \u0027a terrible girlfriend\u0027 because she is \u0027far too demanding\u0027 and that she should wait until she was 28 to get a boyfriend. He also wrote about being lonely on his trips abroad.\u0027There are so many beautiful girls here but I\u0027m faithful to my wife as I don\u0027t believe in unfaithful behaviour and I know you approve!!!,\u0027 he wrote while staying at the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow. He went on to say that when Cat got married: \u0027I will be at the wedding. You will make a lovely bride. I will be sooooo proud. It will all happen for you,\u0027 he wrote in another. \u0027I know you believe and trust me. I\u0027ll be checking you\u0027re OK throughout this holiday. Plus I love teasing you.\u0027In another, he asks if she has an eating disorder because \u0027you are a thin girl\u0027, adding: \u0027Although my opinion is that you look good.\u0027 He says that because her weight is \u0027natural and good\u0027, \u0027in the future I can take you out for dinner\u0027.Other topics he addressed included Cat\u0027s ambition to be a midwife.\u0027It seems absolutely disgusting and revolting to me,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027Babies are so annoying. None of them are cute but every parent thinks their own one is. I favour sterilisation.\u0027He added: \u0027Any woman that has a baby and cannot properly look after it should be deported to another country and should be forcibly sterilised so they can\u0027t have any more.\u0027Cat says that when she finally told a teacher about his messages, she was told: \u0027It\u0027s just Mr Belfield being Mr Belfield.\u0027 Another told her to block him on social media.She says that when she deactivated her Instagram account, Belfield sent the school nurse to tell her he needed to be able to have contact with her. I said that he could email me but the nurse came back and said it has to be WhatsApp so he can call you or Instagram.\u0027I didn\u0027t want to give him my number so I reactivated my Instagram account.\u0027Belfield grew up in Cornwall before graduating from Trinity College, Cambridge, with a maths degree in 1994. He began teaching a year later at independent Concord College in Shrewsbury. It was there he met his wife Barbara. They married in 2001. He became head of sixth form at Ruthin School in 2001. He was made principal in 2010.When Cat finally left the school in May last year, Belfield was temporarily suspended while investigations were undertaken but returned to work in September. He hasn\u0027t been seen at the school since November last year, when the school was inspected twice by the Care Inspectorate Wales and Estyn, the Welsh Ofsted.Cat\u0027s mother Susan, a former teacher, says that after seeing the messages which had been sent to her daughter \u0027I called social services, the Care Inspectorate Wales, the Charity Commission, the Education Workforce Council and Estyn, everyone I could think of to ask why he hadn\u0027t been sacked.\u0027Social services explained that because he worked in an independent school the governors had to make that call and their hands were tied.\u0027She says she subsequently contacted the chair of the school\u0027s Council of Management, Julie Oldbury, and asked her \u0027How would you feel if it was your daughter?\u0027\u0027But all she kept saying was \u0027no comment.\u0027 \u0027The school source who spoke to the Mail said that, thanks to Belfield\u0027s success at the school, he had become virtually untouchable — and that he was \u0027a dictator who wouldn\u0027t be challenged\u0027.The source spoke of the \u0027complete control\u0027 Belfield exerted over the school, particularly given his combined roles as both head and bursar.\u0027Because he manages the money as well, he has control over everything,\u0027 says the source. \u0027He is like a kingpin between the Council of Management and the rest of the school and it was just him in the middle speaking for both sides. He has made himself indispensable.\u0027The inspection report by Care Inspectorate Wales last week concluded the school was being run by an \u0027autocratic and controlling management\u0027.This week, Estyn also published a report of their findings after their \u0027unannounced focused visit\u0027 in November, saying the role of the principal \u0027is not defined precisely so it is not clear to what extent the principal is exempt from specific guidelines and why this should be the case, how the principal is held to account and consequently what the principal can and cannot do\u0027.The Council of Management welcomed the publication of the reports and said in a statement that it \u0027has been working tirelessly to ensure both reports\u0027 recommendations are implemented and has been carrying out a root-and-branch strategic review of its safeguarding governance and safeguarding arrangements, and that is continuing.\u0027The school is determined to ensure all appropriate steps are taken. In response to the Estyn report, the Council of Management produced a comprehensive action plan to address the shortcomings identified, and other areas of improvement. This was submitted to the Welsh government on January 17 for approval.\u0027Belfield appears to have relished the control he has exercised at the school. \u0027I have complete authority,\u0027 he wrote in one of his messages to Cat. \u0027I can do whatever I like. I can go to any country I feel like. I\u0027m creating a new school piece by piece. By the time I retire I will have created something forever — and I will be remembered for many years!!!\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Got Brexit UK finally leaves EU Britons country celebrate","story":"Share this article              Mr Johnson signed the ratified Withdrawal Agreement last week in another highly symbolic step towards BrexitJanuary 24: Mr Johnson signs the ratified Withdrawal Agreement in another highly symbolic step. January 29: MEPs approve the Withdrawal Agreement by 621 to 49.

Thousands of miles away in Central America, KMS earned more dirty money, this time from the American government. It was 1984, the height of the Cold War, and the Reagan administration was obsessed with removing Nicaragua’s Marxist Sandinista government. The former US President is pictured aboveLandon, whose son Arthur is a socialite and friend of Princes William and Harry, was on close terms with Thatcher, which may have dissuaded concerned mandarins in Whitehall — the previous Labour government had considered banning all mercenary companies — from kicking up a fuss.KMS also had a friend in Lord Royle, the Tory vice-chairman in the Eighties, who acted as its informal link with the Foreign Office. But for all its links to people in high places, not every KMS trooper was comfortable with its blatant disregard for military ethics.One KMS contractor who couldn’t turn a blind eye to the mercenary group’s atrocities was former SAS trooper Robin Horsfall, a veteran of the Iranian embassy siege operation in London in 1980.He accepted a KMS job in Sri Lanka in 1986 aged 27 after working as a bodyguard for Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed.Imagining KMS to be a responsible organisation, he hoped it would be different to the ‘Dogs Of War’-style mercenary outfits that had rampaged through Angola and the Congo in the Sixties and Seventies.But after just four months as a battle school commander in Sri Lanka, he quit, appalled at the ethnic slaughter taking place around him. The tipping point came when a South African helicopter pilot described to him how his Sri Lankan door gunner had on one occasion mown down every living creature in sight.However, when asked by the Mail about what he witnessed, Mr Horsfall insisted that he does not believe former British military personnel were directly involved in war crimes — as they themselves didn’t fire weapons at civilians.‘I have no knowledge of that and never heard of anything like it —and I’m sure I would have heard,’ he says. ‘But there is no doubt that the Sinhalese commanders perpetrated genocide against the Tamils.’By 1985, KMS’s name curiously disappeared from government documents, but its subsidiary company, Saladin Security — founded in 1978 by Walker — lives on, and to this day has strong links with Saudi Arabia’s despotic regime.And what of those who made money from their involvement in these secretive wars?Major Baty lives in retirement in England. When visited by Miller and asked about his role in the dirty war in Sri Lanka, his reply was short and to the point: ‘Bugger off!’As for Walker, he re-invented himself as, of all things, a local Tory councillor on Elmbridge Council in Surrey for a time.Before his election, he reportedly told voters that he was ‘a man of action’ and involved in ‘defence matters at a national level’.In 2017, on learning of a ceremony commemorating the STF, he penned a letter to its then commandant, praising its founders.Describing Keenie Meenie’s role in Sri Lanka from 1983, he wrote: ‘It continues to be a matter of great pride that I frequently heard STF described as the most effective force in the country.’‘Effective’ is one way to describe it.

The evacuees went into a two-week quarantine. Indonesia also sent a plane.The number of confirmed cases in China rose to 11,791, surpassing the number in the 2002-03 outbreak of Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome).The virus\u0027s rapid spread in two months prompted the WHO to declare it a global emergency on Thursday.That declaration \u0027flipped the switch\u0027 from a cautious attitude earlier to recommending governments prepare for the possibility the virus might spread, said the WHO representative in Beijing, Gauden Galea. Most cases reported so far have been people who visited China or their family members.                Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside is caring for the British nationals from the coronavirus-hit city of Wuhan in ChinaThe agency acted out of concern for poorer countries that might not be equipped to respond, said Mr Galea. Such a declaration calls for a co-ordinated international response and can bring more money and resources.The WHO said it was especially concerned that some cases abroad involved human-to-human transmission.\u0027Countries need to get ready for possible importation in order to identify cases as early as possible and in order to be ready for a domestic outbreak control, if that happens,\u0027 Mr Galea said.On Friday, the United States declared a public health emergency and President Donald Trump signed an order barring entry to foreign nationals, other than immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents, who visited China within the last 14 days, which scientists say is the virus\u0027s longest incubation period.China criticised the US controls, which it said contradicted the WHO\u0027s appeal to avoid travel bans, and \u0027unfriendly comments\u0027 that Beijing was failing to co-operate.

Japan and Germany also advised against non-essential travel to China as did Britain, except for Hong Kong and Macao.A plane carrying Indians from Wuhan landed in New Delhi on Saturday. The government said they would be quarantined in a nearby city, Manesar.Sri Lanka also pulled out more of its citizens and promised to bring out the remaining 204 students.South Korea\u0027s second evacuation flight landed in Seoul with 330 people from Wuhan. They were to be screened for fever before being taken to two quarantine centres.South Korea also reported its 12th virus case, which appeared to be a human-to-human transmission.          People wearing protective masks walk in a park in Beijing on Friday as the death toll from coronavirus continues to rise         A pharmacy employee wears a face mask in Hong Kong as a preventative measure to protect against the deadly virusAt least 23 countries have reported cases since China informed the WHO about the new virus in late December.The death rate in China is falling but the number of confirmed cases will keep growing because there are thousands of specimens from suspected cases yet to be tested, the WHOS\u0027s Mr Galea said.\u0027The case fatality ratio is settling out at a much lower level than we were reporting three, now four, weeks ago,\u0027 he said.Both the new virus and Sars are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those which cause the common cold. Experts say there is evidence that the new virus is spreading among people in China.Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with family or other close contact, they are concerned about cases of infection spreading to people who might have less exposure.         Tourists wearing protective masks stand on the side of a street in Hanoi, Vietnam, on SaturdayIn Japan, a tour guide and bus driver became infected after escorting two tour groups from Wuhan.In Germany, five employees of a German car parts supplier became ill after a Chinese colleague visited, including two who had no direct contact with the woman.She showed no symptoms until her flight back to China.On Saturday, Japan reported its 17th case, a woman in her 20s who also worked as a guide for Wuhan tourists on the same bus as the two other cases.Vietnam confirmed one more case for a total of six, and Australia counted its ninth infection.On Friday, Germany confirmed a sixth case, a child of one of the people already infected.In the US, health officials issued a two-week quarantine order for the 195 Americans evacuated this week from Wuhan.It was the first time a federal quarantine has been ordered since the 1960s, when one was enacted over concern about smallpox, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said.None of the Americans being housed at a Southern California military base have shown signs of illness, but infected people do not show symptoms immediately and may be able to pass on the virus before they appear sick."},{"url":null,"title":"Motorists sound horns loudly wait extra long traffic lights","story":"Share this article          Once the noise levels reach 85 decibels, the equivalent of the sound coming from a diesel engine, the red light resets its countdown to turning greenA police officer says: \u0027Welcome to the honking capital of the world.

She’s been an elementary-school teacher, a photographer and a civil rights activist. She has founded theatre groups and been a professor of anthropology. “I like to say, I’ve worn a lot of different hats,” she tells me with a laugh one morning last week on the phone from her home in Atlanta, Georgia.Today we are mainly talking about her photographs, a selection of which are to feature in a new exhibition at Turner Contemporary in Margate called We Will Walk – Art and Resistance in the American South. But the story behind Derby’s wonderful, intimate pictures is enmeshed with the rest of her extraordinary life she often wore several of her hats at the same time. Her experience also provides a revealing snapshot of the rupture that America went through in the 1960s and 70s.Derby grew up in the Bronx, New York, and an engagement with the civil rights movement was in her DNA: her grandmother was an early activist in the NAACP (the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) her father was a civil engineer often overlooked for jobs he was well qualified for. “When I was in elementary school, nothing in the history books had anything to do with telling me about my history,” she says. “I’d think: ‘Why aren’t black people being represented in these books? And stories, movies.’ We weren’t in them. But we were here.”But Derby became fully committed in 1963: the year of landmark protests in Birmingham, Alabama, and the March on Washington (where Martin Luther King Jr told the 250,000-strong crowd: “I have a dream”). She’d been asked to work on a literacy programme in Mississippi – initially she said no, but events demanded a rethink. “As many other people were, I was aghast at what was happening in Birmingham,” Derby remembers, “with the police and their dogs and the firehoses and the billy clubs, beating these people who are dressed up orderly, and just trying to see about integrating the facilities there, and seeing about registering to vote. I saw that on the news, and I just decided that if these people were so brave to do that, to fight for the right to vote for all of us as black people, then the least I could do would be to go to Mississippi to work.”Initially, Derby was involved with teaching and voter registration, but around 1966 she was given a camera by a new organisation, Southern Media, which was setting out to document the civil rights movement. While many of the most famous images from this period show violent confrontations, protests and the iconic leaders, Derby’s approach was different. She was especially interested in women and children, and the day-to-day experience of life in the south at that time. Her photographs didn’t appear on the front pages of newspapers, but were instead used on brochures and leaflets that were distributed directly to the black communities, showing the activities and initiatives that were a less showy but still essential part of the civil rights changes.Derby’s father had given her a Brownie camera when she was a child, and she had an instinctive eye for detail and storytelling. “I also was a painter before I came to Mississippi,” she says, “so a lot of my pictures, when I look through the lens, I’m looking also from a perspective of: ‘How would this look as a picture, a painting?’”Although Derby was not usually at the frontline of protests, there was an ever-present risk in her work. “I had threats around me, I had situations,” she says matter-of-factly. Derby recalls visiting black farmers and the men would stay up all night, guns at their side. “They were very brave,” she says. “Especially in the rural areas, they were threatened that if they had anything to do with the civil rights movement, they would be thrown off the land. There could be firebombs shot into their houses and I knew people that happened to.”Another time, Derby went into a gas station to use the bathroom. “This was a time when civil rights people were integrating bathrooms and other facilities,” she explains. “And a guy came over to me and he put his hand on his waist and he had a gun there. And he told me which bathroom I’d better use.” What did Derby do? “I just left,” she goes on. “I didn’t go in the bathroom. But I mean, he was prepared to do things. So you never knew when things were going to happen.”Derby insists that it was not particularly unusual for a woman to chose to move to the south, with all the dangers that entailed. What was rare in her case, though, was how long she stayed: nine years, until 1972, when she went to the University of Illinois to study anthropology. “I was just…” she pauses. “I was very involved in the work in Mississippi. I felt like it was what I should do. And it just seemed like more things came up that could use my skills and it was just my time to give what talent I had. There was such a need, and my skills were needed.”• We Will Walk – Art and Resistance in the American South runs at Turner Contemporary, Margate, 7 February-3 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fa130376304b056e3cd93659dedd9a95c2d606e/95_376_1636_982/master/1636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b59b89b32b246747fed88048838b412","title":"kimono catwalk fashion japan","story":"From the 17th to the 20th century the kimono was the principal piece of clothing in Japan for both men and women. But now it’s an inspiration for fashion all over the worldFashion as we know it – the business of clothes-as-zeitgeist, as distinct from simple dressmaking – was invented in Paris by Louis XIV in the second half of the 17th century. This, at least, is fashion’s widely accepted creation myth. The Sun King and his finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, established a luxury fashion industry which enshrined France as the world leader in taste. To help the lavish new court at Versailles eclipse the austere, black-clad glamour of Madrid, they introduced a rigid schedule whereby new fabrics were issued twice a year – not just warmer or lighter to reflect the weather, but in new colours each time – and the fashion “season” was born.But travel 6,000 miles east to Kyoto, home of the kimono, and the history of fashion looks quite different. In the late 17th century, a demand for luxury textiles among the burgeoning Japanese merchant class grew so fast that by 1700 the narrow streets of the Nishijin district thundered to the clacking of an estimated 7,000 looms. The headquarters of Yamaguchi Genbei’s 10th generation family-run kimono business is testament to the garment’s powerful history. This elegant atelier, where studios with lacquered floors look on to a light-dappled central courtyard, helps tell the story of the kimono as an alternative narrative to a Eurocentric history of elegance. Yamaguchi’s designs, and his family collection of antique kimono, attract visitors from the highest echelons of the fashion industry. When Giorgio Armani visited last year, they spent five hours together. (Mr Armani was particularly taken with an obi with silver embroidery cascading down one vertical seam, a design based on how glaze flows on to a ceramic, Yamaguchi said.) Both Chanel and Nike have also sent sizeable delegations to pay homage to this Kyoto version of an haute couture house. Here in Japan, in other words, fashion has never been about Paris.Kimono: Kyoto to Catwalk opens at the V\u0026ampA later this month, with fashion currently the toast (or at least, the bread-and-butter) of many major museums. Last year’s Dior show at the V\u0026ampA had 594,994 visitors, the largest in the museum’s history. The kimono exhibition will include box-office showpieces such as Obi-Wan Kenobi’s Star Wars robes, a dress designed by Alexander McQueen and worn by Björk on the cover of her album Homogenic and Oscar-winning costumes from Memoirs of a Geisha alongside rare 17th and 18th-century kimono.The exhibition comes at a time when museum culture in the west is belatedly being interrogated for vestigial traces of imperialism. Meanwhile, cultural appropriation has become an incendiary topic in a fashion industry which finds itself newly answerable to a global audience. Last year, Kim Kardashian was forced to backtrack on a lingerie range she had initially named Kimono. “I understand and have a deep respect for the significance of kimono in Japanese culture,” she said in a statement, changing the name of the line to Skims. In 2013, Katy Perry’s appearance at an award show dressed in a kimono to perform her song “Unconditionally” – sample lyric: “I’ll do it all for you  Because I love you, I love you unconditionally” – drew criticism for playing into erotic fetishisation of subservient Asian women.“The whole point of this show is that the kimono is something dynamic, not a dusty museum piece,” says Anna Jackson, curator of the V\u0026ampA exhibition she argues that the best way to respect the kimono is to tell its story not as artefact or exotic treasure, but as a sophisticated garment that has shaped fashion, reflected society, travelled the globe, fallen from grace and staged comebacks over a tumultuous 400-year history. “If you put the kimono on a pedestal you don’t honour it, you patronise it. It is when you treat the garment as a costume on a shelf, with no life and no future, that you stereotype it.”The word kimono means, literally, “thing to wear”. A simple, straight-seamed garment, wrapped and secured with an “obi” sash, it was the principal item of dress for men and women in Japan from the mid 16th until the early 20th century. From the interwar period, western influence made itself felt on kimono design – the exhibition catalogue includes a kimono from this period stencilled with the unmistakable graphic silhouette of the Empire State Building – and after 1945 kimono fell out of favour as a “thing to wear” on the streets.In Kyoto, the specialist dealer Konjaku Nishimura carefully dons gloves to unwrap an 18th-century kimono embroidered with cranes – a popular motif for weddings, as cranes are said to mate for life and to live for a thousand years – which has a pricetag of ¥2.5m (£17,600). “If you wore it, you would be ruining it.” Nishimura is wearing a black kimono his elderly father by his side is in chinos, a blazer and a button-down shirt. The generational gap reflects how, in the past few decades, the kimono has made a comeback among Japanese too young to remember it as streetwear. As well as antique treasures, Nishimura does a brisk trade in kimono sold at Bond Street prices as occasionwear to affluent Japanese women. Jotaro Saito, the fashion designer who recently put denim kimono on a Tokyo fashion week catwalk, sells enough kimono to have a sleek boutique in Tokyo’s Ginza Six mall.At dusk in Kyoto, temples are crowded with Japanese teenagers who have rented colourful kimono by the day from local shops and are busy taking selfies. It is an indulgent, elegant tradition. The kimono’s cameo roles in western culture – eroticised on screen in Memoirs of a Geisha, or watered down into a sort of ornamental waitress uniform – are only fragments of its many lives on the streets of modern Japan.We in the west are conditioned to look at where clothing sits in relation to the female body to place it in time. (The bustle-back of Victoriana, the dropped waists of the flappers, the miniskirts of the sixties.) Kimono have been cut to essentially the same pattern for four centuries, the only addition a little extra fabric to keep pace with the increasing average height. It is the colours and patterns, rather than the shape, that come and go. Symbolism in the embroidery shifts, as lucky charms move in and out of fashion – the unicorn, you might say, is the new crane.When wearing a kimono “the body is irrelevant”, Jackson says. The fulcrum of the garment is placed on the shoulder, not the waist. This concept, radical in womenswear, played a pivotal role in changing how women dressed during the 20th century. In 1903, two decades after the Rational Dress Society began promoting non-restrictive clothing for women, Paul Poiret took the kimono as the starting point for his corset-free fashion which took Paris by storm. From Poiret, the line of fashion succession leads to the box-shaped jackets and straight-lined skirts of Coco Chanel.Hiroko Takahashi, a fashion designer whose style today is reminiscent of Chanel – the blunt dark fringe, the cool emotional tone, the black boat-neck sweater – started her career designing western-style clothing but now focuses on kimono because, she says, there is no better way of dressing. She is dismissive of the traditional museum-eye view of them, which prizes lavish fabrics and intricate embroidery. “I don’t care how difficult it was to make, or how long it took to make, if the end result isn’t beautiful,” she says. She works only with circles and straight lines which represent, she says, pure elegance. “I want people to realise that we can enjoy life with what things we already have. I am a perfectionist. That’s why I like kimono.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1183e29a78a72e07bb29130de2e487639dcc205f/0_463_5689_3413/master/5689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=670cde6c69b1ef2c0c02ffc99e9c28bd","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"The coronavirus outbreak, tributes to Kobe Bryant, the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and the Australian Open tennis – the best photography from around the world in news, culture and sport"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45234b3b1af10050d4a2c35f84f41f4101f80a40/108_351_4498_2699/master/4498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04b53f540e86df536bd727998c779870","title":"original observer photography","story":"Steve McQueen, Bill Nighy, Julia Fox, Big Narstie and more – the best photography commissioned by the Observer in January 2020"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c3250a46998d3ba96f6881dd6b26b9841dfb2fe/0_0_2961_1776/master/2961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7f69031c22f1067781ed2feb53d31d3","title":"mark zuckerberg being popular is so over its about winning now","story":"When it comes to widespread popularity, Mark Zuckerberg is not exactly the Mrs Brown’s Boys of the international community, beloved by the public no matter what the big bad mainstream media says about him. Last week, he appears to have accepted his role as the Bond villain of our online lives. “My goal for the next decade isn’t to be liked, but to be understood,” Zuckerberg told investors. “In order to be trusted, people need to know what you stand for.”Facebook deserves our trust about as much as that bowl of unwrapped mints by the till in your local takeaway, but even so I am fascinated that Zuckerberg is now taking his public relations cues from every memorable reality show contestant in the history of television: he is not here to make friends, he’s here to win.Well, I assume he is here to make friends, with his cousins-twice-removed on another continent, that person you didn’t speak to at school but whose daily existence you know more about than your real-life neighbour’s, several conspiracy theorists who are suddenly experts in virology, and that girl you once worked with who tags you in competitions every other day. To give up even trying to be liked (a bit like your great-uncle with those political posts, eh?) is a classic late-season reality show pivot.In reality TV, the “I’m here to win” contestant never actually wins. They’re the one who thought they might, at the start, despite all evidence pointing to the contrary. They’re the one whose big secret is that they really want to be liked, and the fact that they are not liked at all is a kick in the teeth. It makes them more villainous, more determined to act to be remembered, since they might as well get something out of it.But this is not TV. While social media lacks the niceties it once pretended to deal in – my Facebook Memories, in particular, are an embarrassing reminder that 12 years ago, nothing was too banal to be shared, not even, and I am truly sorry, the ukulele phase – it worked its way into our lives by seeming personable. Business analysts have noted that Facebook is facing a difficult year, and is, accordingly, preparing for war. For the gloves to come off so openly, for Zuckerberg to say that its decisions may now be unpopular, but he will be making them because he believes them to be right, is deeply ominous. Still, I look forward to being able to click “Understood” on a video of a cat falling off a table.This year’s Grammys had threatened to collapse under the weight of the organisation’s internal scandals, and the ceremony was understandably overshadowed by the death of Kobe Bryant. This meant that memorable moments were few. Billy Porter continued to win the red carpet with his lampshade hat that opened on cue, and, lord knows, I love fashion that requires a remote control. Tyler, the Creator brought his mum on stage and was brilliant and articulate about his disdain for the label of “urban” music. Billie Eilish triumphed in seemingly every category, which, given that the Grammys are roughly 47 hours long and give out gongs for Best Trumpet Sound on an Off-Broadway Foreign-Language Musical Soundtrack, was well deserved.But there was one particularly striking moment. Demi Lovato, back in the public eye after a near-fatal overdose in 2018, debuted her song, Anyone, which she had written before she was hospitalised. She began to sing but, choking up, had to stop after a few seconds. She composed herself, started again, and got through it.In a recent interview with Zane Lowe, Lovato said she recorded Anyone “very shortly before everything happened”. She said she listens now to its desperation and thinks “how did nobody listen to this song and think ‘let’s help this girl’?”Jessica Simpson, a pop star of a different era, is about to release her memoir, Open Book, and has been talking about her alcoholism, and how, at 17, she turned to pills after being told to lose weight by a record label executive.These stories are so horribly familiar. Lovato’s Grammys performance felt like an act of defiance, and a celebration of resilience.With Next in Fashion, Netflix has sewn a sparkly seam into the reality TV format and has made it gripping for the first time since some genius realised that whipping up a Victoria sponge in a tent against the clock had more dramatic potential than yet another “big-city detective, small-town murder” series. As it’s on an international streaming service, it has continued the Netflix trend for bringing together contestants from all around the world, and its casual ersity is one of the best things about it. It’s just open to all.The other best thing is Tan France, who co-hosts with Alexa Chung. I know it’s daft, but ever since I found out that France is from Doncaster, where I used to go out as a youngster, I have loved him. He joins my mental list of celebrities – along with Youngblud and Louis Tomlinson – who might also have enjoyed ice-skating at the Dome.France rose to fame through the vajazzled Queer Eye, and stepping to the front suits him, particularly when he has a moment of pure emotion that can almost compete with Tyra Banks’s much-memed “We were all rooting for you” outburst. Almost. Let’s hope there’s a season two."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/234709838af8913ee13a19ba738425b8bdc7c933/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02f8ef894e3158324c5edd2d7c56c487","title":"stop brexit remainers eu referendum politics","story":"Until quite recently, many people fervently believed this day would never arrive. Just over three months ago, Brexit finally seemed to have pushed British politics to the brink of a nervous breakdown. There were tears and tantrums in parliament. There were petitions and protests outside. A litany of lawsuits was waiting in the wings to derail the whole process. Ardent remainers felt they were tantalisingly close to stopping Brexit altogether. The future looked wide open.From a second referendum to a government of national unity, from toppling over the cliff edge to beating a full retreat, almost anything appeared possible. Yet here we are – one day after formally leaving, just as the British people decided on 23 June 2016 – and all that is gone. What happened? Were the last four years a mirage?The emotions were real. It was the sense of possibility that was an illusion. In recent years, some surprising political outcomes have seemed to pass from being impossible to being inevitable without ever taking the time to be merely improbable. Jeremy Corbyn’s election as Labour leader was like that: what couldn’t conceivably happen suddenly couldn’t be stopped. Brexit has taken us on a much more circuitous journey.Before the referendum, plenty of people assumed that leaving the European Union was out of the question. Then, in the immediate aftermath of the vote, it looked like a fait accompli. Shocking though the result might have been, the choice was clear and we would all have to live with it – just like any other election result.Yet over the following months and then years, Brexit drifted back into the realms of the improbable. There were so many potential barriers in its way, and so many people determined to raise them, that what had seemed like a done deal gradually became an open question. Opposition, which might have been expected to dissipate over time, instead grew. Rather than a result to which the losing side needed to reconcile itself, it became a historic injustice to be avenged.It was as though the Brexit referendum had torn a hole in the normal functioning of British politics. We had passed through a portal to somewhere strange – and the job was to find a way to return to the place we had left behind. The opponents of Brexit took heart from the fact that because the referendum had apparently upended the old political order – along with their own sense of order – it ought to be possible to upend Brexit. The way to undo the referendum was to treat it as a rupture in the political space-time continuum, and to repair the tear.This was a mistake. The Brexit referendum did not stand outside the normal run of British politics. It was a product of that politics. The illusion was to believe that direct democracy, in the form of a high-stakes referendum, had somehow derailed parliamentary democracy and that therefore the task was to get it back on track. But Brexit all made sense – and only made sense – as a product of parliamentary democracy. An elected government, enacting its will through parliament, made the referendum happen. Only an elected government, enacting its will through parliament, could deal with the consequences. The old rules still applied. Everything else was just for show.The show included the growing demands for a second referendum. It was a passion play, full of its own heroic performances. This demand made total sense for anyone who believed that the first referendum was an outlandish event that needed to meet its match: having passed through the portal we required some equivalent way of passing back. But if you started from the premise that we had never left politics as usual, then pushing for a second referendum was always a quixotic enterprise.There was no way to get there. Parliament would have had to agree not only that it was a good idea, but also on the question to be asked, the rules under which it was to be held and the meaning of its outcome. This was obviously impossible in the existing parliament. But any parliament that could not agree on Brexit would not have been able to agree on a second referendum. And any parliament that can agree on Brexit doesn’t need one.Why did the illusion take such a strong hold over so many people? As with much else in contemporary politics, there was a generational ide. Among older remainers, for whom the result of the referendum was wildly outside the bounds of what they understood as political normality, it seemed like it had to be countered in kind, with something equally abnormal. For younger remainers, especially those in their late teens or early 20s, the last few years had been the only politics they really knew. Wasn’t this – the chaos, the emotion, the sense of possibility – how it worked? No. But it’s easy to see why it would look like that if that’s all you’ve encountered.The general election of 2017 helped to perpetuate the illusion. Labour came very close to another enormous shock. It looked once again like anything might be possible. But Labour only managed to do as well as it did by parking the issue of Brexit. Both main parties went into that election promising to respect the result of the referendum. It was only when Theresa May’s failure to win a majority produced a weak and vulnerable government that it seemed as though the result might have been a rebuke to Brexit itself. It wasn’t.In 2017, when the fate of Brexit was not on the table, people voted in a way to make Brexit harder to achieve. But in 2019, when two years of parliamentary stalemate had put Brexit in serious doubt, they voted to make Brexit happen. The seeming possibility of stopping Brexit was an unintended byproduct of the voters having assumed it was bound to happen. Once that assumption came into question, Brexit became inevitable again.It was not only on the remain side that it sometimes felt as though everything was up for grabs. Plenty of Brexiteers were deceived, too. Within the parliamentary Conservative party the despair was palpable during the nadir of May’s government. The fear was real that not only might Brexit be lost, but the party itself might be wiped out. In last spring’s European elections the Conservatives polled the lowest national vote share in their history, while Nigel Farage’s Brexit party was riding high. But the Tories have one great advantage at times like these. When no one knows what to do, Conservatives focus on their parliamentary survival. And since parliamentary survival is the name of the game in a parliamentary democracy – nothing about the Brexit referendum had changed that – it often works.The person who saw this most clearly was Dominic Cummings. At a low point in the fortunes of Boris Johnson’s new government last autumn, when it had been defeated in the courts, was being stymied in parliament and mocked in the press – “Classic Dom!” – Cummings gave a rare public appearance in which he said that compared to winning the referendum itself, what he was going through as the prime minister’s chief adviser was “a walk in the park”. It sounded shockingly arrogant. He can’t have meant he knew he was going to win in the end – no one ever knows that. But it did mean that he knew the only way to win. He had no choice but to focus on the fact that the existing parliament would never agree on how to stop Brexit, and to get to a new parliament his opponents would have to give him a general election under circumstances that did not suit them. The rest was just noise.Cummings was convinced that the really hard part had been to win the referendum itself, given that the old rules still applied. He had needed to shock the existing system. Engineering a successful public vote to take Britain out of the EU in the face of establishment opposition – including in parliament, where most MPs were strongly opposed to the idea – was truly an outrageous achievement. But since the old rules still applied, turning the referendum result into reality through parliament was far more straightforward.All he had to do was reabsorb the shock back into the existing system. The status quo would take care of the rest. The iconoclast could safely reinvent himself, if only for a few months, as an upholder of the established order. Even the failed prorogation of parliament, which probably generated the most passion of all, was another distraction. Cummings wasn’t really trying to get round parliament. He was just trying to get parliament to function like it used to.With hindsight, we can see that the illusion Brexit might be stopped made it easier for Brexit to happen in its current, harder form. Opportunities were missed to moderate it. If Labour MPs who were tempted to vote for May’s deal early last year had actually done so, we would have had a softer Brexit than the one that is now looming. But hindsight creates its own illusions. May’s deal became softer as she became weaker in parliament her weakness in parliament made it much harder for Labour MPs to support her deal. Those who considered it were accused of “complicity with Brexit”.Propping up a wounded prime minister under those circumstances looked like treachery. For all the sound and fury, few politicians felt they had much of a choice. They were boxed in by the growing intensity of sentiment on all sides, as much as they were by parliamentary arithmetic.From the day of the referendum result, Brexit was probably inevitable. It sounds fatalistic. But it doesn’t have to be: if the old rules still apply, then from today everything changes again. Up until this moment, the Brexit vote was something that parliamentary politics needed to acknowledge – it had to be swallowed, somehow. But now it’s been swallowed, it ceases to be an event that any government is required to accommodate. It becomes something that this government owns.It also ceases to be the people’s responsibility. It’s now Johnson’s responsibility. This means the will of the people can no longer be so readily invoked in the face of parliamentary opposition. The people didn’t make his deal and the people didn’t pass this legislation. The people aren’t going to negotiate the future relationship either. It’s on Johnson and his ministers and his chief adviser. So the opposition is free to let rip.It’s true that the people chose this government and this prime minister at the last general election. So isn’t it still ultimately the voters’ responsibility? But that’s not how parliamentary politics works. The voters don’t own the consequences of their choices at election time. They reserve the right to blame the politicians they pick for everything that subsequently happens. We don’t choose the policies in a representative democracy. We choose the politicians. And if anything goes wrong, it’s the politicians we will get to pillory.As it passes from unspecified future event to messy present reality, Brexit has gone from being something that almost nothing could derail to something that almost anything could. Coronavirus? A global recession? A trade war between the US and China? None of these is about Brexit, but any of them could make Brexit a much more precarious business. If that happens, we will know who to blame. It will be Boris Johnson’s fault, even though none of that is really his fault – unlike the referendum result, which really was his fault, and for which he could never be made to shoulder the blame, no matter how hard people tried.If we want an idea of how things might go from here, one possible parallel is with the Iraq war. Of course, in that case there was no referendum beforehand. But there were huge street protests, passionate opposition, massively ided public opinion and a widespread sense of looming calamity. It couldn’t be stopped, because the opposition could not muster enough support in the one place that mattered: parliament. Both of the two main parties were full of doubters, but it proved impossible to make those doubts decisive in the face of a prime minister with a large parliamentary majority determined to forge ahead. The Liberal Democrats, who became the vehicle for parliamentary opposition, never had the numbers to make the difference.The voting public, who had elected the Tony Blair government that did the deed, somewhat reluctantly re-elected that government in 2005. But the voters never blamed themselves for what happened. They blamed their rulers for having lied to them. They took their time, but when they got the chance the people took their revenge, in part by ejecting Labour and helping the Liberal Democrats into coalition government. In some ways, the people have been taking their revenge ever since.One of the long-term consequences of the Iraq war and the mistrust it sowed in the British political system was Brexit. Revenge in such cases can be a dish served very cold indeed. The long-term consequences of Brexit – the Brexit that this government is now undertaking on the people’s behalf but no longer in their name – are likely to be equally profound. Some governments will eventually be broken by it, perhaps even including the current one.Once the people had voted for it in the referendum, Brexit was bound to happen in some form. But now that it is happening in its present form, the people are free to think again. The last four years created the impression that British politics had entered a new space of possibility. That was an illusion. The real possibilities start today.• David Runciman is professor of politics at Cambridge University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32da93ac2401785d863deeaa5754a12a6e584847/0_318_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e5738e087c84421c339af51c319d749","title":"brexit midsummer nights dream politicians","story":"It unearthed some of the worst people in the country – on both sides. And the worst of all were the politiciansTonight’s Parliament Square party to mark Brexit was hit by a ban on booze, live music and fireworks – the first three in a presumably infinite series of things that we now won’t be able to blame on boring Brussels bureaucrats. Right about now, you’re probably starting to think “Oh my God … what if … what if we were the bastards all along?” Crazy as it may seem on this day of national emancipation, it’s just possible that one day we might yearn to be plugged back into the matrix where it was all someone else’s fault.Still, to the victor go the spoils. Brexit is done, except for the many big bits that aren’t. All UK humans must absorb the sledgehammer implication of the fact that a man with the mind and moral stature of Nigel Farage is far and away the most successful politician of his generation. Like Farage said last week: “Unless this government drops the ball, and I don’t think it will, you will never, ever see me again.” And like he said this week: “I look forward to a new role with Newsweek, where I shall be commenting on the battles ahead.”Either way, there are indications that the curtain between reality and metaphor has been finally rent. Consider the fact that on Brexit eve, Farage stood in what appeared to be a London restaurant’s attic and unveiled a hideous portrait of himself. Instead of being accompanied by a brilliant Wildean dandy saying things like, “Nigel – you are the type of what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found!”, Farage was instead introduced by occasional Dubai émigré Jim Davidson, who made a joke about France that I can’t lavish a keystroke on. Trivia completists may care to know the title of Nigel’s portrait was Mr Brexit, and not 55?!?!?! – Fuck Me, He Had A Hard Paper Round.To mark the occasion, the government has newly minted, or reminted, a special Brexit 50p coin. If you get one, hang on to it – it might be worth something one day. Something like 20 euro cents. Or 1600th of a threadworm tablet under the new US-friendly drug pricing. When coming up with their big Brexit marker, it’s interesting that the Tory right decided to go with pieces of silver, a concept closely associated with historic betrayal. Perhaps they’re trying to reclaim it for themselves, along with Calais, and the idea it’s fine to say the N-word because rappers do it.They’re certainly using the moment as a fundraising opportunity, and have spent much of the week acting as a sort of off-brand Franklin Mint. Tuesday’s big push alerted buyers to their range of Brexit “merch”, which is exactly how the target market for this stuff talks. A second drive offered people the chance to “own Brexit” in the form of a copy of the withdrawal agreement signed by Boris Johnson. Tickets for the draw are £5. It’s a lovely idea – and is it scalable? Even now, perhaps one of the oddballs hired by Dominic Cummings is working out whether you could technically fund a new hospital by selling copies of the statement “I will build a new hospital” signed by Boris Johnson. Soon enough, the dominant form of intranational trade in the UK will be the exchange of items signed by Boris Johnson. Johnson has long been aware of the value of his signature, which is why he has avoided flooding the market by withholding it from a number of birth certificates.In terms of economic prospects, meanwhile, it’s a huge psychological boost for Brexit that most of Britain’s newspapers are in favour of it. Remember: always take business advice from journalists, the runaway market leaders in the poorly managed decline sector. Brexit could be the UK pivoting to video. To get a visual feel for what the  calls “the glorious future”, go online and try loading a  story. People call Brexit a project of false nostalgia, which here feels right: Renaissance masterpieces were actually downloaded on to canvas quicker than an article headlined “DI TOLD ME BREXIT WON’T AFFECT MY HOUSE PRICE”.But here we all are. That was the Brexit that was. And what was it? It had the mad energy of A Midsummer Night’s Dream but went on for three and a half years. The sheer litany of WTF-ery that occurred would take precisely three and a half years to recount. At one point Michael Howard threatened war with Spain. It was the golden age of television drama, but people instead found themselves watching BBC Parliament in the evenings, initially capable of making wan comparisons with Game of Thrones but eventually lacking the energy to do anything but wish a dragonfire apocalypse on everyone involved.It certainly unearthed some of the worst people in the country. On both sides, let’s be honest. By the time we were a few months in, most of the haute remainers could make you turn hard Brexit whenever they appeared on the news. Just as Donald Trump would be richer if he’d simply invested his inheritance in a tracker fund and done nothing, it feels likely that the leading forces of remain would have been in better shape three years into the horror show if they’d taken a vow of silence on 24 June 2016 and stopped trying to “help”.For my money the Brexiteers were even worse, but others will argue we’re comparing Aids with syphilis. The second I saw Pimlico Plumbers boss Charlie Mullins (remain) park for one Brexit high court challenge by mounting his personalised-plated Bentley on the pavement, I immediately channelled arms and strategic intelligence to pro-Brexit contras.To each remainer their Brexit analogue. Charlie’s was Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin, a man who looks like a cautionary tale about his own pubs. Or take Brexiteer James Dyson (actually, I think Singapore already has). Dyson, as we never stopped hearing, is an inventor – a term that apparently allows him to walk through the same door as the creators of the steam engine and radio. Naturally, I yield to no one in my admiration for minor hand-dryer improvements. But Dyson basically does things that blow or suck, doesn’t he? Maybe that’s why he was drawn to Brexit.Needless to say, the absolute worst people of all were the politicians, from the sensationally limited Theresa May to supply cult-leader Jeremy Corbyn, via committed anti-elitist Jacob Rees-Mogg, reservist idiot Mark Francois, and so on via a gazillion Tory wingnuts to the ghastly John Bercow – accused of multiple instances of bullying – whose lionised impunity served as a useful “how radicalised are you?” test for remainers.The ultimate victor, pyrrhic or not, was Boris Johnson. On the day of withdrawal, then, I guess the key philosophical question is: how can something whose own internal logic made Boris Johnson prime minister be wrong?From his days as the ’s Brussels fabulist, Brexit has been an end-to-end service by Johnson, who you’d think ought to look happier about it. But as tonight’s broadcast will unwittingly show, emotion is his phantom limb – which he feels the twitch of occasionally but primarily experiences as a sort of yawning absence assuageable only by the usual temporary fixes.He does not appear to be a man who enjoys a short leash, which is perhaps why he has set the clock on himself for the trade negotiations, to introduce some of the jeopardy he has historically sought out in other pursuits. But no longer. Boris Johnson must now play the Henry V to his own Falstaff, which is his tragedy. We all have to watch, which is ours."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee955a2f6605438799d680e77273d959b78b7d7f/0_232_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef56ac5fc79dc59dab1b78cc0c71e91b","title":"overwhelmed prague tries to limit airbnb to curb tourism","story":"For decades, its mesmerising blend of baroque and gothic beauty was closed to mass tourism by the iron curtain that ided the communist east from the capitalist west during the cold war.Now Prague, which has gained an unenviable reputation as a destination for stag nights and pub crawls, has become the latest European city to propose a radical assault on Airbnb and other short-term letting platforms as over-tourism threatens to overwhelm it and drive out residents.Under plans pushed by the city’s liberal mayor, Zdeněk Hřib, property owners would be barred from leasing out entire flats except when it was their own home and they were temporarily vacating it. Tourists demanding Airbnb rentals would be limited instead to single rooms in accommodation where the owner also lived.Speaking to the Observer in his office in Prague’s new city hall – near the heart of the tourist district – Hřib, a member of the Pirate party, said the idea was the focal point of a scheme to “give Prague back to the people of Prague” and mitigate the negative effects of tourism.He said Airbnb’s growth had turned the city, once the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and later a jewel of the Habsburg monarchy, into a “distributed hotel” and that failure to regulate it was “eating the city from inside”.“In the past, you could limit the amount of tourists in the city simply by approving a certain number of hotels of certain capacity during the process of building permits,” said Hřib. “Now in Prague there is no possibility for the city to limit the accommodation capacity for tourists. The numbers are really critical.”Nearly 8 million tourists flocked to the city – total population, 1.3 million – in 2018, up from 2.6 million in 2000, numbers that are expected to keep rising and which Prague’s infrastructure and finances are ill-equipped to cope with.The increase has accelerated as Airbnb has consolidated its presence, transforming previously sleepy residential districts into busy zones characterised by foreign visitors with tell-tale wheeled suitcases in residential blocks.An impact report from the city’s institute of planning and development said the number of Airbnb outlets almost tripled from 5,537 in March 2016 to more than 13,000 in May 2018, representing a jump from 17,913 to 52,738 in the number of beds. Eighty per cent of available rentals are entire flats.The result has been an increase in noise and disturbance to long-term residents and soaring property values and rents that have priced locals out of the housing market. An average Prague resident needs to pay 14 times the annual salary excluding tax, housing, eating and clothing costs to buy a flat in the city, the mayor said.Meanwhile the council has faced a widening financial shortfall as the nominal local tax levied on owners, some of whom live outside the Czech Republic, often goes unpaid and fails to cover the costs of the growing strain on resources and services.“This is far beyond the original idea of the shared economy where you are supposed to let a tourist stay in your home, you cook the breakfast and you tell them something about your nice city,” Hřib said. “This is just a distributed hotel, where you abuse the comfort of other citizens in the city, the local residents, and seek your own profit at their expense.”The European court of justice recently ruled that platforms like Airbnb were “information society services” rather than estate agencies, making them harder to regulate.Hřib plans to overcome this by persuading the Czech regional development ministry to back legislation allowing local authorities to issue their own laws and decrees on short-term holiday lets according to local conditions. Similar efforts have previously failed, but the mayor insists that the growing awareness of Prague’s problem has generated enough political support for a law to pass.Apolena Rychlíková, a film-maker and journalist who has campaigned against the unfettered growth of short-term lettings, welcomed the city council’s proposal, “after five years of ignoring the problem”. She added: “As a resident of the centre of Prague, I feel like a stranger in my city every day. And I’m not alone.”Janek Rubeš, a creator of the Honest Guide, a YouTube channel documenting the effects of over-tourism in Prague, said Airbnb’s evolution had harmed the city’s neighbourhoods. “These Prague apartment blocks aren’t made for tourism. Tourists have different needs from locals,” he said.“They need a 24-hour reception, where they can get into buildings when they need to. It doesn’t work like that on Airbnb. It was a great idea at first, but not the way it is now.”Prague is not alone in its stand against Airbnb. Last month, the council joined 10 other cities - Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Bordeaux, Brussels, Krakow, Munich, Paris, Valencia and Vienna - in signing a letter calling on the European commission to update its laws. “These short-term rentals are primarily for tourists at the expense of locals and families who want to live and work in our cities,” the letter says.Some of the cities have imposed their own limits on the platform and similar outlets. In January 2019, Amsterdam tightened its rules on rental of entire homes to fewer than 30 days, from 60 days.In Palma, Mallorca, authorities went further, issuing a ban in 2018 against almost all short-term Airbnb-type rentals of flats on the island, after local residents had complained of a sharp rise in rents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6caddb9759b9968003e022181e4386b1ea1e00d7/0_159_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4366075dc43fdce44c30602cf0ab1315","title":"former energy minister removed as un climate talks chair","story":"Source says officials in COP26 unit could not work with Claire O’Neill in run-up to Glasgow talksClaire O’Neill, the former UK energy minister who was to lead the UN climate talks this year in Glasgow, has been removed from the post.Her sacking comes as Boris Johnson prepares to launch the UK’s strategy for hosting November’s crunch climate talks, known as COP26.O’Neill, under her Twitter handle of @COP26President, wrote on Friday evening: “Very sad that the role I was offered by Boris Johnson last year has now been rescinded as Whitehall ‘can’t cope’ with an indy COP unit. A shame we haven’t had one climate cabinet meeting since we formed. Wishing the COP team every blessing in the climate recovery emergency.”The dramatic last-minute change of plan follows murmurings over the past month that O’Neill, known under her previous married name of Perry when she was a minister, lacked the gravitas for one of the most important jobs in international politics this year.A source in the COP26 unit said: “Claire has seriously underperformed, including at Davos and on a recent ministerial visit to India. She had said ‘the Paris agreement is dead’ in key meetings to the surprise of everyone.“She didn’t seem to get that this is a diplomatic job. The senior team of officials in the unit couldn’t work with her and her erratic behaviour and poor performance has spooked key stakeholders in the UK and internationally. She had to go. The PM now needs to show he is taking this seriously by appointing a heavy-hitting minister.”Achieving the consensus needed among world governments will be a mammoth task – many countries, including the US, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Russia, are now hostile to the Paris agreement, and others including China and India have been unwilling to make big new public commitments under the accord.O’Neill’s previous experience peaked at junior minister, which was regarded by some diplomats as not enough to gain her the respect needed to get meetings with premiers and top officials around the world.Observers of the UN talks interpreted her removal as a sign that Johnson was taking COP26 more seriously. He will make his first public intervention on the issue next Tuesday, when he will launch the UK’s COP26 strategy, at an event with Sir David Attenborough, the climate expert Lord Stern, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, the UN’s climate chief, Patricia Espinosa, and a host of dignitaries.“A good COP president makes all the difference between success and failure,” said one former high-level diplomat and COP veteran. “They direct the negotiations, they play the key role in determining the outcome.”Tom Burke, the co-founder of the environmental group E3G, said he thought that either William Hague or Michael Howard, both former Conservative party leaders, could be possible choices to replace O’Neill. “If this is a sign that the government really wants to signal its intent to make a success of COP26, it has to appoint some more senior people, and those two candidates come to mind,” he said.The Cabinet Office, which has been leading on the COP26 talks, declined to say whether a successor had been chosen. There have been rumours among climate activists that Zac Goldsmith could take on the role, and O’Neill’s tweet appeared to suggest that responsibility for COP26 could be taken away from the Cabinet Office.The Cabinet Office put out a statement: “Claire Perry O’Neill will no longer be UK COP26 president. The prime minister is grateful to Claire for her work preparing for what will be a very successful and ambitious climate change summit in Glasgow in November. Preparations will continue at pace for the summit, and a replacement will be confirmed shortly. Going forward, this will be a ministerial role.”That could leave the way open for a House of Lords appointee.Responsibility for the UK’s participation in the annual talks was previously held by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, after the closure of the Department of Energy and Climate Change.Another COP expert said whoever took on the job must have the clear and public backing of the prime minister, and that Johnson must take a much stronger public role on the issue.In her parliamentary career, O’Neill was best known for having to apologise when, unable to catch the Speaker’s eye, she wondered aloud in the House of Commons to whom she needed to “give a blowjob” in order to get her say.She also issued a putdown to David Davis when he confused her with another female Tory minister, Caroline Nokes. Referring to Davis’s previous campaigning slogan, she is reported to have told him: “David, let me help you: Caroline is a C cup, I am a double D.”Her exuberant manner also led to trouble. In November 2018, three unions wrote to BEIS, where she was a minister, to raise allegations of shouting and bullying civil servants.O’Neill started out as a political radical. The environmentalist George Monbiot recalls her at Brasenose College, Oxford, where she studied geography, as “a leftwing firebrand who wanted to overthrow capitalism and nationalise the banks. She was impressive and persuasive, and had some influence on my thinking. You can imagine my disappointment when she took a City job and became a Tory.”She entered parliament with the coalition government in 2010, her no-nonsense approach belying the patronising “Cameron cutie” label.O’Neill announced her decision to resign as an MP last September, citing the pressures of the COP26 presidency, and she stood down in December’s election. That left her free to jet to foreign capitals, but outside cabinet discussions.Johnson’s government is vulnerable to charges that ministers are not prepared to make the hard decisions required against vested interests in fossil fuels and finance. There was a major hiccup at the Africa summit last week when, as Johnson pledged not to invest in coal in Africa, the  drew attention to the almost £2bn finance from the UK pouring into African oil and gas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e520f0489668b0859fb624c17775a31bef82e164/0_0_3745_2497/master/3745.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df25c7f70a8297a63009c99f5fc52149 700w","title":"a beautiful day in the neighborhood review tom hanks mr rogers","story":"Tom Hanks is wholesomeness itself in Marielle Heller’s tribute to US children’s TV star Mister RogersFred Rogers – beloved in the States for his unfailingly sanguine persona, but largely unknown in the UK – was an American television presenter and the man behind the popular, long-running children’s series Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.This exquisite adaptation of Tom Junod’s 1998 Esquire profile paints a carefully shaded picture from a sceptic’s vantage point. When investigative reporter Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) is assigned a puff piece about one of the nation’s heroes, he takes it upon himself to locate the dark heart of Mr Rogers (Tom Hanks, the epitome of on-screen goodness). There isn’t one. Director Marielle Heller (2015’s The Diary of a Teenage Girl, 2018’s Can You Ever Forgive Me) cleverly mines comedy from Rogers’s boundless empathy as Vogel tries to probe for weak spots, finding only his own.

The idea is to enjoy a long, peaceful life with each slurp and break free from the past as the noodle breaks easily with each bite. In its simplest form it is made using buckwheat soba noodles and a hot dashi broth, but I’ve taken liberties and bolstered it with soy-caramelised cabbage and some turnip pickles.For the soy cabbage2 tbsp rapeseed oil 1 large red cabbage (around 800g), cored and chopped into 1cm pieces 1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped 4 tbsp mirin 1 tbsp rice vinegar 1 tsp fine sea saltFor the soup1 large piece kombu (about 50g)4 tbsp brown rice miso 4 tbsp light soy sauce4 tbsp mirin 200g soba noodles 2 tbsp toasted sesame oil 60g watercress, stalky ends removedFor the turnip pickle2 small turnips (around 200g), peeled, cut into thick matchsticks ½ tsp fine sea salt 100ml rice vinegarStart with the cabbage. Heat a large frying pan on a medium heat, add the oil, then the cabbage and onion, and cook, stirring occasionally to stop it sticking, for 30 minutes. Add the mirin, vinegar and salt, and cook for 20 minutes more, by which time the cabbage should be caramelised and very tender.While the cabbage is cooking, get the soup base started. In a medium saucepan, bring one and a half litres of water to a boil, lower the heat to a whisper, add the kombu and simmer for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the kombu with a pair of tongs and discard. Whisk the miso, soy sauce and mirin into the hot broth and leave to one side.Next, pickle the turnips. In a jug, mix the salt into the vinegar and 100ml freshly boiled water, then pour over the turnip in a heatproof bowl and set aside.Cook the buckwheat noodles according to the packet instructions, taking a minute off the cooking time, then drain and rinse under cold water. Transfer to a bowl and mix through the toasted sesame oil.To assemble, ide the noodles between four bowls. Gently heat up the broth, pour it over the noodles, then top with the caramelised soy cabbage, watercress and pickled turnips, and serve.

Like most boys his age, plain pasta or bread are Flynn’s first choice – always! – but he also surprises us now and then with an out-of-character enthusiasm for, say, cabbage one day or mussels the next. This makes cooking for him a chancy experience – unless soup is on offer. For reasons known only to Flynn, a soup can feature all manner of normally undesirable ingredients without so much as a peep of protest. As he’s the youngest and the loudest in the family, the rest of us have to toe the line. But we do this willingly and lovingly, of course, because what’s better than a bowl of warm soup and a blissfully quiet child?Chicken wings are a great and economical way to ramp up the chicken flavour in a soup. This one comes together fairly easily, without having to soak the beans overnight. To make it more child-friendly, serve it without the salsa.2 tbsp olive oil500g chicken wings2 onions, peeled and finely chopped 4 garlic cloves, crushed with the flat of a large knife250g plum tomatoes, finely chopped1½ tbsp picked oregano leaves1½ tbsp basil leaves, finely chopped1 tbsp thyme leaves3 tbsp Worcestershire sauce ½ lemon Salt200g dried black-eyed beans 1 litre chicken stockFor the salsa1 green chilli, finely chopped (remove the pith and seeds if you prefer less heat)1½ tbsp basil leaves, finely chopped1½ tbsp parsley leaves, finely chopped3 tbsp olive oilPut a large, heavy-bottomed pot on a medium-high heat and, once hot, add the first eight ingredients and fry, stirring often, for 12 minutes, until the wings are beginning to colour. Add the Worcestershire sauce, lemon and two and a half teaspoons of salt, and fry, stirring often, for three minutes more. Add the beans, add the stock and 300ml water to cover, and bring up to a simmer. Lower the heat to medium, cover with a lid and cook for 35-40 minutes, or until the beans are cooked through but not falling apart.Turn off the heat, then use a pair of tongs to transfer the wings to a plate and leave to cool. Squeeze the cooked lemon into the soup to release all its juices, then discard the shell. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, pick the meat off the bones and add it to the soup pot discard the skin and bones. Return the soup to a medium heat for five minutes, just to heat through. Meanwhile, mix all the salsa ingredients in a small bowl with a good pinch of salt.Divide the soup between four bowls, top with salsa and serve.This take on French onion soup features hawaij, a Yemeni spice blend that complements the sweet onions, and brings with it extra complexity and warmth. The cheesy bread is optional. If you prefer to keep the soup vegan, use vegetable stock instead of chicken and extra oil instead of butter.75ml olive oil, or 50g unsalted butter plus 2 tbsp olive oil1.2kg onions (ie, about 7-8), peeled, halved and thinly sliced1 tbsp coriander seeds2 tsp cumin seeds2 whole cloves8 cardamom pods, seeds removed and shells discarded½ tsp fenugreek seeds½ tsp ground turmeric250g tomato passata30g fresh coriander, roughly chopped1 x 400g tin chickpeas, drained (240g net weight) 1.5 litre vegetable or chicken stockSalt and black pepperFor the cheesy bread (optional)220g mature cheddar, roughly grated10g fresh coriander, roughly chopped1 large garlic clove, peeled and crushed6 slices sourdough, cut about 2cm thick 15g unsalted butter, softened1 tbsp dijon mustardPut the oil (or butter and two tablespoons of oil) in a large, cast-iron saucepan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onions, stir to coat them in the fat, then turn the heat to medium and cook gently for an hour, stirring every 10 minutes or so, until completely soft and golden.Meanwhile, make the spice mix. Put the coriander and cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom and fenugreek in a small frying pan on a medium-high heat. Toast, shaking the pan frequently, for five to six minutes, until fragrant, then tip into a spice grinder and blitz to a powder. Stir in the turmeric and set aside.When the onions are done, turn up the heat to medium-high, add the spice mix, passata and fresh coriander, and cook, stirring occasionally, for five minutes. Add the chickpeas, stock, one and three-quarter teaspoons of salt and a very generous amount of pepper, and bring to a boil. Turn the heat back down to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.For the cheesy bread, if making, heat the grill to its highest setting. In a small bowl, mix the cheese with the coriander, garlic and a good grind of pepper. When the soup is close to ready, put the bread on a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper, grill it for a minute, then remove from the oven and flip over. Brush the untoasted side first with butter and then mustard, top with the cheese mixture and grill for three or four minutes more, until golden and bubbly. Cut each slice into three.Divide the soup between four bowls, top each with three slices of cheesy bread and serve with the remaining cheese bread alongside.I use garlic three ways here: roasted to add sweetness, fried for crunch and garlic oil to drizzle on top. Feel free to double or even triple the number of garlic heads you roast – the cloves can be kept in oil in a sealed jar and used in spreads, dressings or even folded into mashed potato. This soup thickens as it sits, so add more liquid to get it to a consistency you like.3 whole heads garlic, top trimmed to expose the cloves, plus 6 extra cloves, peeled and thinly sliced105ml olive oil, plus extra for drizzlingSalt and black pepper1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 1 medium celeriac (700g), peeled and cut into 1½cm cubes3 cinnamon sticks1½ tsp dried oregano80g short-grain rice500ml vegetable stock2 lemons – 1 cut into 6 ¼cm-thick rounds, the other juiced, to get 1½ tbsp10g parsley leaves, roughly chopped3 spring onions, trimmed and thinly sliced½ tsp chilli flakes (optional)Heat the oven to 240C (220C fan)465F gas 9. Drizzle the garlic heads with a little oil, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper, then wrap them inidually and tightly in foil and bake for 30 minutes, or until lightly coloured on top and softened. Once cool enough to handle, use a small, sharp knife to separate the cloves, discard the skins and set aside.Meanwhile, put two tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion, celeriac and cinnamon, and cook, stirring occasionally, for eight minutes, until everything is softened and lightly coloured. Add the oregano and rice, stir to coat, then pour in the stock, 1.3 litres of water, one and three-quarter teaspoons of salt and a good grind of pepper. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to medium-low and cook gently for an hour, stirring occasionally, until the rice has started to break down into the soup. Transfer 200g of the mixture (taking roughly equal amounts of solids and liquid) to a blender, add the roast garlic and lemon juice, and blitz smooth. Pour this back into the soup pot and keep warm until ready to serve remove and discard the cinnamon sticks.While the soup is cooking, put a large frying pan on a high heat. Remove the pips from the lemon rounds and, once the pan is hot, add them to the pan and cook for two minutes on each side, until nicely charred. Finely chop the charred lemon, then put it in a bowl with the parsley and spring onion.Heat the remaining five tablespoons of oil and the sliced garlic in a small frying pan on a medium heat, and cook until the garlic starts to turn golden – eight to nine minutes. Add the chilli flakes, if using, cook for a minute more, then drain the solids through a sieve set over a bowl, and add the oil to the lemon and herb mixture.Divide the soup between four bowls, top each portion with a drizzle of the lemon and herb dressing, followed by the reserved fried garlic and chilli, and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08e5b2556163e13922069ba84d5c27eb80c2cda2/115_29_2154_1292/master/2154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7585bdb3672cfc1fd302b65d90fe1b3b","title":"leicester chelsea premier league match report","story":"After Frank Lampard was left peeved by Chelsea’s failure to sign a striker in January, his centre-back Antonio Rüdiger did his best to soothe the manager’s concerns by scoring with two fine headers here. But those were not enough to close the gap on Leicester, who earned a share of the points thanks to goals by Harvey Barnes and Ben Chilwell. The result leaves Brendan Rodgers’ side relatively comfortable in third place, eight points above fourth-placed Chelsea, who can feel the breath of the chasing pack on their backs.Last season Chelsea finished 20 points above Leicester. But Rodgers’ team have improved since then and the Londoners have not. Lampard is spooked by the strengthening of other clubs, suggesting the purchases made by Manchester United and Sheffield United make Chelsea underdogs in the fight for the last Champions League qualification spot even if Chelsea occupy it for now. “We must be super-underdogs then, given where we were at the start of the season,” quipped Rodgers.Lampard’s angst cannot have been eased by the profligacy of players other than Rüdiger here, especially in a first half in which Chelsea’s lack of sharpness in front of goal prevented them from taking a lead they would have deserved. Several times teasing crosses were delivered into the home box – usually by Callum Hudson-Odoi or the excellent Reece James – but no attacker showed enough instinct and poise to get on the end of them. Tammy Abraham was full of enthusiasm but was certainly not clinical after being declared fit enough to play despite the ankle knock he suffered in the draw with Arsenal two weeks ago. One wonders what Olivier Giroud made of it all. The Frenchman, denied a January move away, was not even in Chelsea’s squad here.Kepa Arrizabalaga was dropped to the bench, as Lampard decided that the out-of-form goalkeeper needed a reminder than his No 1 spot is not guaranteed. “We have to be competitive,” said Lampard, who instead gave Willy Caballero his first Premier League start since May.The 38-year-old must have fancied his chances of keeping a clean sheet here as Leicester made an uncharacteristically sluggish start. Their attempt to show that they were not deflated by their midweek Carabao Cup defeat at Aston Villa suffered a setback even before kick-off when Wilfred Ndidi felt pain in his knee and was replaced in the starting line-up by Hamza Choudhury.For the first 25 minutes Chelsea practically had the run of the place. César Azpilicueta made regular bursts down the left, virtually unhindered by Ayoze Pérez. But when the left-back supplied an inviting centre in the fifth minute, Hudson-Odoi gave an indication of what was to come from Chelsea’s forwards in the first half by swishing at fresh air from the edge of the area.Chelsea continued to create danger but their final touch was regularly awry. Leicester woke up in the 25th minute, jolted into action by sloppy play from Chelsea. Azpilicueta played a careless pass that Pérez chested into the path of Jamie Vardy. It was Caballero’s time to shine, the keeper rushing off his line to block the shot from Vardy, who went for power rather than precision.Leicester came close to taking the lead just before the break, when Choudhury leapt above N’Golo Kanté only to head wide.Within 57 seconds of the restart Rüdiger did what Choudhury had tried to, taking advantage of hesitancy in the Leicester backline to head a corner into the net at the back post. If he hoped his attacking team-mates had taken note of his emphatic finish, Rüdiger would soon be dismayed to realise that his goal inspired Leicester. The hosts struck back with two goals in 10 minutes.Barnes scored the first after being released down the left by Youri Tielemans. The winger also enjoyed assistance from Andreas Christensen, who inadvertently deflected his shot over the wrong-footed Caballero and into the net.Caballero was caught in the wrong place again in the 64th minute after deciding to chase an overhit cross by Chilwell. The goalkeeper did an about-turn when he realised Ricard Pereira would beat him to the ball but he did not get back in position in time to stop Chilwell from swatting a low cross from Tielemans into the net. Lampard was more angry that no defender was tight on Chilwell.Chelsea did not look like equalising until Rüdiger soared above Chilwell to meet a free-kick from the left by Mason Mount and powered the ball in from 15 yards.Jonny Evans had a chance to emulate his centre-back counterpart but nodded wide from six yards after being left free at a corner. Then Barnes was presented with an even better opportunity by Vardy but sidefooted wide from 10 yards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f608d3a3fd754c6c3aab4ac8901b81ce29f81fd3/66_164_2645_1588/master/2645.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22b2af274dd5aa7e22474282b07769a4","title":"leicester city v chelsea premier league live","story":"Antonio Rüdiger scored two sumptuous headers to earn a point for Frank Lampard’s side at the King Power Stadium So that’s your lot. Paul Doyle was our man at the King Power, and his verdict has landed. You can enjoy that by following the information superhighway hotlink below. Thanks for reading this MBM!A slightly frustrated Brendan Rodgers adds: “We should win the game. We’ve conceded two disappointing goals. I thought the players overall showed a really good mentality and created enough clear-cut chances to win the game. But we’re a little frustrated that we couldn’t win it. I thought Chelsea started better but we worked our way into the game. The mentality to come back and get in front was very good. It was important that we didn’t lose today, to keep the advantage over Chelsea is important. But it’s still all to play for. We’ll see where we’re at with ten teams to go. For us to be in this position, the players have been fantastic but we have to stay focused.”A reasonably content Frank Lampard speaks. “I thought it was a pretty even game. We were the better team in the first half. In the second half we weren’t so fluid and they had some clear chances. We have worked in training to get more goals from set pieces, so to get two was pleasing. I thought Willy Caballero’s performance was good. We were underdogs for top four at the start of the season. We’ve got a well-fought draw at Leicester and we move on.”The essence of a chat with Antonio Rudiger, who has deservedly won the man-of-the-match award for his two-goal antics. He’s happy, as you can imagine, and he’s having no truck with that late penalty shout. “The ball touched my hand, but it was not my intention to touch it.”On the other hand, Chelsea may be happy enough with a point at the home of a very fine team. Leicester are now on 49 points, two shy of Manchester City in second and eight clear of Chelsea, who are fourth with 41. Still, the draw means the chasing pack can close the gap: Manchester United and Wolverhampton Wanderers, currently on 34 points, can get to within four of Chelsea if they win tonight’s showdown at Old Trafford. Tottenham can do likewise if they take down the champions tomorrow afternoon. Fascinating, right?Great second-half entertainment and a fair result. A result that’s better for Leicester, comfortable in third, than Chelsea, looking over their shoulder in fourth.90 min +5: Barnes skedaddles down the left and cuts inside. He crosses in the hope of finding Maddison in the middle. The ball pings off Rudiger’s hand. Leicester want a penalty. Rudiger’s hand was behind his back, and there was a little movement, but not enough to interest the referee or your pal and mine, Mr VAR.90 min +3: Evans picks up a yellow for a garden-variety clatter.90 min +2: A break in play as Evans goes down with cramp. He’s put in quite a shift, to be fair.90 min +1: Iheanacho nearly finds Perez down the right, but the pass doesn’t stick. Had it done so, Chelsea were in a bit of trouble at the back.90 min: There will be five minutes of added time. More than enough for somebody to find a goal that could shape the rest of their season.89 min: Barnes nearly breaks clear down the left but is forced to turn tail. The tension is palpable as both teams probe for a winner.87 min: A Kante dribble down the right earns Chelsea a corner. Rudiger rises in the hope of completing what would be a fairly unexpected hat-trick, to say the least. But he can’t get a third header away.86 min: Hudson-Odoi is good to continue. If the glance he’s just shot Chilwell is anything to go by, he’s not convinced by the accidental nature of the challenge.85 min: Hudson-Odoi has taken a whack upside the head, in an accidental collision with Chilwell. He looks to be in some pain, repeatedly whacking the turf with his palm. On comes the physio.84 min: The slew of changes has disrupted the flow of this otherwise fine second half. There’s not a lot going on right now.83 min: Chelsea make their final change, throwing on Barkley in place of Abraham.81 min: That’s Vardy’s last contribution. He makes way for Iheanacho, while Tielemans is replaced by Praet.80 min: ... and Leicester should have scored it. Vardy is sent scampering down the right. Chelsea are super-light at the back. Vardy rolls the ball across to Barnes, who simply has to score, but flicks his shot inches wide of the bottom left. Caballero was out of the picture.79 min: Abraham looks to bustle down the middle and into the box, but the door slams shut just in time. There’s another goal in this game.77 min: Maddison’s free kick pings off the wall. Corner on the right. Maddison takes that too ... and he should have an assist to his name, Evans unmarked in the centre, eight yards out. He slaps his header wide right. What a miss! In the dugout, Brendan Rodgers is a study in disbelief.76 min: Perez sashays in from the right and is clipped from behind by Kovacic, cynically taking one for the team. Yellow. Perez was either preparing to shoot, or feed Vardy just inside the box. Instead this is a free kick just to the right of the D. Maddison fancies this.74 min: Frank Lampard was preparing a double change before the equaliser, and doesn’t let events dictate. Pedro and Jorginho are replaced by Willian and Kovacic.73 min: A free kick for Leicester out on the right. Maddison hoicks it into the mixer. Rudiger wins another header, this time clearing back upfield. The big German is having some game.Pereira clips Mount out on the Chelsea left. A free kick and a change for Chelsea to hit back. And how they hit back! Mount takes the free kick himself floating it towards Rudiger at the far post, ten yards out. Rudiger rises majestically and plants a header across Schmeichel and into the top left! What a header that is. Regroup 101.69 min: Tielemans pearls a low diagonal shot towards the bottom left. Caballero does very well to get down and parry. The visitors need to regroup quickly.68 min: Chelsea are chasing shadows at the moment. 66 min: That was a real rush of blood by Caballero, who went scampering along the byline after a ball he was never likely to reach. Leicester have responded fantastically to going behind so early in the second half. If they can hold onto this, a Champions League spot is surely theirs.A penny for Kepa’s thoughts. Chilwell and Barnes combine crisply down the left. Chilwell overhits his cross. Cabellero races off after it, but can’t get there ahead of Pereira, who cuts back for Tielemans. The ball’s played back across to the left, where Chilwell is free to blast into the top left. Cabellero couldn’t get back in time. Oh Willy.62 min: Mount takes the free kick ... and it’s hopeless. A curler towards the far post sails harmlessly high into the stand behind. Maybe the wind caught it, let’s give the young man the benefit.61 min: James dribbles his way down the inside-right channel and is cynically tripped from behind by Maddison. It’s a clear free kick and a yellow card.60 min: After the excitement of the goals, we’re back into Fascinating Mode. Bah. All a little scrappy as the teams battle in the middle of the park.58 min: Now Kante goes lunging in on Chilwell. Just a free kick, though you’ve seen yellow cards flashed for such late extended-leg shenanigans.56 min: Leicester have the momentum now. Pereira floats a ball in from the right. Vardy is sniffing at the far post, but the ball hangs in the wind and it’s easy meat for Caballero. Then in the midfield, Jorginho hangs out a leg to stop Maddison, and that’s the first booking of the match.Oh, they up their game! Tielemans drifts down the inside-left and slips Barnes clear on the wing. Barnes cuts inside and shoots. The ball clips off Christensen and loops across a wrong-footed Caballero and into the top right. A fortunate deflection but a fine move.53 min: Maddison’s corner fails to beat the man on the near post. Mount clears. The King Power is pretty quiet at the minute, the Chelsea fans taking the opportunity to make themselves heard. The home heroes need to up their game.52 min: A high ball down the Leicester right. Perez brings it to earth gracefully, then wins a corner. Maddison to take.50 min: Schmeichel has started this half in a very uncertain fashion. Having dithered over the goal, he now fluffs a kick upfield, gifting the ball to Jorginho. A better pass from the Chelsea midfielder would have put Leicester in all sorts of trouble, but his attempt to release Abraham down the inside right is a clunker, and Schmeichel is off the hook.49 min: Leicester try again. A free kick in a central position, 30 yards from goal. Maddison can’t get round the wall. But this is a decent response from Leicester, after falling behind so soon after the restart.48 min: Leicester nearly strike back immediately, Barnes skittering down the left, reaching the byline, and nearly finding Vardy in the six-yard box. Caballero does brilliantly to kick clear.Mount sends a curler towards the far post. Schmeichel thinks about coming, but stops. Rudiger rises and heads past the stranded keeper. Simple as that!Chelsea get the second half underway. They’re immediately on the front foot, Azpilicueta crossing from the left, Choudhury forced to hack out for a corner. From which ...Mount slips a pass to Hudson-Odoi, down the inside-right channel. Hudson-Odoi loops a dismal effort high and wide. Leicester go up the other end and win a corner, from which Choudhury heads harmlessly wide right from six yards. The entire half in microcosm, right there. Like I say, it’s not been awful, but, y’know. “Is it time to haul out the commentator’s special, an ‘intriguing tactical battle?’” Adam Kline-Schoder speaks for me.45 min: Vardy bustles his way down the right, but is stopped on the edge of the box by Christensen. Barnes has a look down the other flank, but hoicks his cross - or was it a shot? - high over the bar.43 min: Chelsea are knocking at the door. James flicks another dangerous ball in from the right. Evans half-clears. Kante has a bash. Evans, a one-man wall, stops that one too. The Leicester defender has been sensational today.41 min: Mount nicks the ball off Chilwell and feeds Hudson-Odoi down the right. Hudson-Odoi returns the ball to Mount on the penalty spot. Mount can’t get a shot away. He should leave the ball for Kante, steaming in behind, but shifts to the left and has another go. His eventual effort is blocked.39 min: James drops a shoulder to make a yard down the right. He curls a low ball across the face of goal. Evans slices over with Pedro and Abraham in close attendance. James is such a fine prospect as an attacking right-back. Alexander-Arnoldesque.37 min: From the corner, Chiwell blazes over. This game hasn’t quite got going. It’s not been bad, as such, but y’know. The try-hards would file it under ‘fascinating’.36 min: Barnes has another dig from distance. It’s blocked. Chelsea go up the other end, Abraham nearly beating Soyuncu to a bouncing ball. Not quite. The defender clears, accidentally kicking Abraham on the back. No foul. Leicester go back up the field and win a corner.34 min: Maddison looks for an avenue straight down the middle, but can’t bust between Christensen and Rudiger. The ball dribbles through to Caballero.33 min: Tielemans rolls a pass down the left for Chilwell, who pulls back towards Barnes. He leans back and hoicks miles over the bar. That was a very decent opportunity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9c7cf0ac6f4475e66bd4afb1bfdbeee74e58a52/0_222_3128_1876/master/3128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac3984fd251eba107917b5d32541704e","title":"liverpool southampton real madrid atletico derby premier league live football clockwatch","story":"Mo Salah scored twice as Liverpool moved 22 points clear, Brighton fought back at the London Stadium and Everton came from 2-0 down to win at WatfordThat’s it for today’s blog.

Karim Benzema’s goal puts Real six points clear at the top of La Liga, at least until tomorrow.A huge win for Bournemouth, who held on with 10 men after Jefferson Lerma’s debatable red card early in the second half.Liverpool are now four points away from mathematically securing a Champions League place. Oh, and they are 22 points clear at the top. If that’s now awesome, I don’t know what is.Ten-man Everton have come from 2-0 down to win the match! The winner came on the counter-attack, with Theo Walcott reacting smartly to score from Moise Kean’s miskick.Lies, damned lies and football scorelines: Mo Salah has scored another excellent goal to make it 4-0 at Anfield. Imagine what Liverpool will be like when they start dominating games.West Ham 3-3 Brighton Lukasz Fabianski makes a spectacular save from Solly March’s free-kick!“Hi Rob,” says Gar Byrne. “Are the rules of Clockwatch similar to those of Fight Club?”Not really, though I do often feel a compulsion to throw hands.Yes, which is even more astonishing giventhey were just one of the pack in 2017-18.

Trossard hits the side netting from a tight angle, with men waiting in the middle. A Brighton winner could do untold damage to West Ham’s season.James Norwood scores a consolation goal* for Ipswich.“Please explain how Clockwatch works,” says James Boyle. “I’d like to avoid being confused with the ignorant masses out there.”If you knew how Clockwatch works, you’d know I don’t have time to explain how Clockwatch works during the last 10 minutes of a Clockwatch!Glenn Murray has equalised for Brighton!

More to the point, Team VAR thought the same.Bruno Fernandes has gone straight into the Manchester United starting XI for the match against Wolves.“How delightfully fair minded of you to mention Ings’ penalty appeal that was turned down and yet studiously ignore Firmino’s stronger appeal in the first half that was, y’know, also turned down,” says Joe Doran. “Anything to keep that LiVARpool narrative going, eh?”If you had any idea how Clockwatches work, you wouldn’t have sent that email. No, that bit’s not up for discussion. However, you aren’t familiar with the process, so I’ll forgive your ignorant passive-aggression.

Wigan have taken the lead at Elland Road. It has gone down as an own goal from Pablo Hernandez, though there was also talk of a dreadful error from Kiko Casilla. Things are getting exquisitely tight at the top of the Championship.The oft-maligned Karim Benzema has given Real Madrid the lead in the derby. If it stays like that they will go six points clear of Barcelona, who play tomorrow.Liverpool 2-0 Southampton “I think a lot of the insecurity us Liverpool fans are feeling comes from the fact that weve not always played all that well,” says Andy Gracie. “Look at today so far, for example. We seem to win through sheer pigheadedness rather than greatness.”That’s a fair point, and one that makes their record even more astonishing. I’d dispute the lack of greatness, though: they’ve got 73 points from 25 games! Southampton have been much the better team, so they probably knew this was coming. Jordan Henderson finishes calmly from Roberto Firmino’s cutback to double Liverpool’s lead.An extraordinary error from the usually excellent Vicente Guaita, who collects a corner and backpedals over his own line.Another deflected shot from Robert Snodgrass restores West Ham’s two-goal lead. I’d love to stop and chat but there’s been another bloody goal elsewhere.That’s seven goals in three games - two of them as substitute - for Erland Braut Haaland. He’s still only 19.Bournemouth 2-0 Aston Villa Bournemouth are down to 10 men, with Jefferson Lerma seeing his usual yellow card and raising it to two yellow cards.

Daniel Podence is ready to go.”Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on his two new signings. “There have been loads of fans waiting for Bruno Fernandes to come, and the player himself has been a very good influence since he’s come. Of course it’s been a few hectic days for him, but the boost of him being around has been good for everyone. He’s ready to go, he wants to play, and we need some fresh legs. We’ve had 18 games in the last two months, it’s been a big demand for these boys. In Odion Ighalo we’ll get a proper man, a great lad, a good goalscorer. It’s not long ago he was top scorer in the African Nations Cup. I know him from way back in Norway, and he gives us a different option, so I’m delighted that he wanted to come for a few months. It’s great to have him around, and I know he’s a Man United fan.”The Busby Babes. Supporters have this afternoon attended a memorial service for the legendary Babes, forever young after perishing at Munich in 1958. This is the nearest home match to the 6 February anniversary, and it’s apt that Wolves are the visitors today, for the Babes had been travelling home to welcome Stan Cullis’s side to Old Trafford for a title summit meeting two days later. It would have been a must-win for United, with Wolves firmly in control of the First Division that season. When the rescheduled game was eventually played, a makeshift, threadbare United lost 4-0 to the champions-elect.

Also like every millennial, I somehow constantly manage to never do any of the things I need to do to self-improve. I’m hoping that technology can help me get it together – so I got an Amazon Echo 3rd generation, with Alexa.The Echo Dot comes in a small box, which I open up to reveal a small speaker, just larger in diameter than a drinks coaster, but small enough to hold in your hand. Aesthetically, it’s very futuristic – at the top within the light ring are four tiny microphones and four buttons – volume up, volume down, mute and Alexa. It feels smooth around the sides with adaptor and aux ports at the back.Mine is heather grey, but you can get them in charcoal, plum and sandstone too – you can even get one with a clock to show you the time. There’s an information document, a charger, a user manual and a list of commands to try, such as: “Alexa, set a 10-minute timer” and “Alexa, add toilet paper to my shopping list”.To set up, I need to be connected to my wifi and download the Amazon Alexa app on to my smartphone. Set-up is easy, all within the app, and takes about five to 10 minutes – but if you struggle, there are a million and one tutorials on YouTube for you to follow and a dedicated Echo help page.There are a ton of things you can do with the Echo straight out of the box, such as setting alarms and asking it trivia questions. To unlock even more value, you can add skills via the Alexa smartphone app or just by using your voice.I like to tell people I’d be fitter if I had more time to go to the gym, safe in the knowledge that I don’t actually have the time. Now I have no excuse. I never thought Alexa would be able to help me exercise in any way, but I was wrong. The Body Coach skill allows me to work out as Joe Wicks, the Body Coach, keeps me motivated with cries of: “You’ll smash it!” It has seven 15-minute, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts to help you burn fat when you’re short on time, including marching, star jumps, squats, push-ups and crunches – and that’s just lesson one. I can’t say I’m at my target weight yet, but it’s definitely helping me get more regular exercise in.Learning a new language can be quite daunting but with the Translated skill it no longer has to be. I ask Alexa to teach me how to say any word or phrase in Spanish, and Translated reads it out so I can learn how to say it myself. I can even ask the skill to slow down or repeat the translation until I’m happy I’ve nailed it. I’ve already learned how to introduce myself: Me llamo Phil! I’m hoping that a few minutes a day practising while cooking or cleaning can really make me el experto.I often struggle to get to sleep but Sleep and Relaxation Sounds is excellent at resolving this. It has hundreds of ambient sounds that can be used to help with meditation or lull you into a state of complete relaxation. Once the skill is open, I just say: “Alexa, help me sleep”, or “Alexa, play heavy rain”, and I’m zoning out in no time listening to the downpour.My flatmate has an Echo, so we use Drop In – an inbuilt, two-way, intercom-like feature that connects two Alexa-enabled devices together once permissions are enabled. It’s perfect for letting my housemate on the top floor know that dinner is ready. All I had to do was say: “Alexa, drop in on the attic room”, and I can immediately communicate with my flatmate without walking up the steps.It turns out playing a game with a speaker is actually a lot of fun. I try out Twenty Questions: you think of any animal, mineral, music or vegetable and the skill asks 20 questions that you can answer, aiming to work it out in 20 questions or fewer. I play with Beyoncé’s 2016 single Formation – of course – and Alexa gets it in 10 questions. Impressive! You can also play a variety of other games, such as Deal or No Deal and Pointless.Alexa is a lot of fun, but, importantly, she’s really handy at helping you with those small tasks that can take up time or easily be forgotten.

Has the workplace crush had its day?Jenny had been living in Hong Kong for a couple of weeks when she fell “head over heels” in love with Christine, the creative director of a small fashion company. But there was a problem: Christine already had a girlfriend. And another problem: Christine was interviewing Jenny for a job at the company at the time. “The first thing she did when she came in was to sit in her chair and say to me: ‘So you’re the English girl,’” Jenny recalls. “She was very direct – it wasn’t something I was used to. It felt strong.”Jenny, whose parents are from Hong Kong, had decided to move there after graduating from university in 2018, to learn more about her culture. She was 22, and describes herself as extremely shy. She applied for a series of positions at creative companies, but Christine’s firm was the first to invite her for an interview Jenny landed an entry-level position, reporting directly to Christine. Her new boss wasn’t like anyone she’d met before. She was powerful and direct in business meetings, but playful, disarming, even confessional one-to-one. She worked out and channelled a masculine, minimalist style: white shirts, blazers, black turtlenecks. She seemed to take a special interest in the English girl.“There was one moment early on when we were going through some props for a shoot together,” Jenny says. “I was just an intern then – it was a menial job for a director to be helping out with, but she was so caring. She wanted to know more about me.” Within two weeks, Jenny was questioning her whole identity. “I never realised that I had feelings for women before I met her,” she says. “I was surprised that I could feel that way about anyone. I started to think back to all my previous experiences with men and realised there was something lacking. But with my boss – it was different.”Jenny was one of hundreds of  readers who responded to a call-out for tales of workplace romance. The intention was to find out how the business of coupling up at work has changed. According to surveys, about two-thirds of British workers are open to dating colleagues – but human resources and human emotions aren’t always in alignment.Since 2017, the #MeToo movement has helped bring to the surface a series of stories about harassment and misconduct in workplaces, including American Apparel in the US and the Arcadia Group in the UK. In 2018, Monica Lewinsky revisited her workplace affair with Bill Clinton, when she was an intern and he was president, in an essay for Vanity Fair. She wrote: “I’m beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot.”The more recent case of the British former McDonald’s chief executive Steve Easterbrook – fired from a $15.9m-a-year position last November for having a consensual affair with a colleague – highlights just how far some companies are prepared to go to guard against potential abuses of power and troublesome lawsuits, particularly in the US. “Non-fraternisation policies” and “love contracts” are common, typically requiring both parties to declare the relationship, agree that it will not interfere with their work, and potentially move departments in the event of any conflict of interest.There had been no complaint against Easterbrook from his lover, only from the McDonald’s board, who argued that his affair “violated company policy”, which bans employees with “direct or indirect reporting relationships” from having sexual relationships. Easterbrook’s dismissal wiped around $4bn from McDonald’s share price overnight. In December, BlackRock Inc – the world’s largest asset management company – dismissed Mark Wiseman, a senior executive tipped as a future CEO, for a similar breach. “This is not who BlackRock is. This is not our culture,” said an internal memo circulated at the time.The situation in Britain is different. European workers are – in theory, at least – protected from such dismissals by the European convention on human rights, article 8, which grants us the “right to respect for private and family life”. In other words, your company’s shareholders don’t have the right to tell you who you can have sex with, as they do in America.Nonetheless, says Jonathan Rennie, employment partner at the London law firm TLT, business is increasingly international. US conventions are drifting across the Atlantic – and what will happen post-Brexit is unclear. “We’ve had a lot of inquiries from firms about what is and isn’t appropriate, particularly since #MeToo,” he tells me. “Larger companies in particular have identified this as a potential trip hazard.” The compensation is unlimited in sexual harassment cases, he notes, so it’s in companies’ interests to put some kind of policy in place. Even if it is not rigidly applied, the company’s lawyers can then make a “reasonable steps” defence in any potential employment tribunal.He points to Facebook’s Relationships at Work document as an example of a typical US policy, which theoretically applies at a global level. The firm stresses that workers aren’t banned from dating each other – but there are “simple rules” to prevent “unwanted invitations” or “unwelcome flirting”. “If you ask a co-worker out and that invitation does not result in a date, do not ask again” is one rule. Another: “If you do start a relationship with someone in your management chain, it must be disclosed to HR.” People who are in relationships must remain “professional” with one another while at work. And so on.But, as Rennie notes (and he helps to draft this sort of thing) such rules are nigh on impossible to enforce. “There are infinite ways that a relationship might develop,” he says. “The idea that you can cover them all in a policy is a bit heavy-handed.” For instance, when should you disclose your relationship to HR? After you share a fumble at the Slug \u0026amp Lettuce? When your stomach turns to butterflies at the photocopier? “Theoretically, if you fail to disclose, you could be fired,” Rennie says. That sounds dystopian, I remark. “Well, modern life is dystopian!” he laughs.Still, Dame Heather Rabbatts, chair of the anti-harassment campaign group Time’s Up UK, stresses that context is always important when it comes to consensual relationships within the workplace. “Harvey Weinstein has argued in court: ‘There was always consent,’” she says. “Well, how was that consent made? If the senior inidual has power, and consent is given in a context of bullying, that is harassment.“It’s really worth stressing that sexual harassment is still endemic in the culture of many, many companies,” she adds. “The women at McDonald’s have been campaigning around sexual harassment for some time.” (The company has defended its anti-harassment efforts.) Rabbatts doesn’t see relationship contracts as a priority making employees aware of their rights and ensuring they have access to confidential advice is more effective. “At some of the production companies we are working with, the anti-harassment policies are printed out and pinned to the door. I’d welcome that.” Even if the companies are more concerned with their own reputations than the welfare of their employees? “Well, it’s hard to interrogate the mindset of a corporate entity, isn’t it?” she says. “But what is important is the outcome. Employers are rightly concerned with their reputations. There was a time, not that long ago, where sexual harassment wouldn’t have been a reputation issue. Now companies feel they have to address it, and that is to be welcomed.”But while larger firms are becoming more cautious, many startups operate a looser, more informal culture. A former employee of the US startup WeWork, who claimed she was sexually assaulted twice while working for the company, filed a lawsuit in 2018 citing an “entitled, frat-boy culture that permeates from the top down”. The company vehemently denied the claims, which were partially upheld under New York City law. One reporter described WeWork, which at its height managed more than 800 co-working spaces across the world, as a “flirting utopia”. Few smaller companies have policies in place, for the simple reason that they have other priorities. But last year the Financial Times reported that investors were starting to seek “#MeToo clauses” in investment agreements with startups, in order to guarantee that there have been no historical sexual harassment complaints – with an obligation to report any complaints that do arise.One difficulty is that so much of our lives now take place in the grey area between work and non-work, says Michael Ryley, a partner who specialises in employment law at Weightmans. Are work parties work? If you work from home, is your own home the workplace? “And what happens if, for example, I’m in a relationship with someone in the office? If I pat her on the bum and she’s my girlfriend, that’s potentially fine. But if she’s defined as another employee, I could get sacked. And what if the relationship breaks down? Have I harassed a fellow employee, for which my employer is liable? The potential for toxic fallout is considerable.” Nonetheless, he sees McDonald’s-style sanctions as “aggressive”: “I don’t see why an employer should dictate who you can go out with any more than they should tell you what you can eat for dinner or watch on TV.”And there’s a broader shift, too. Esther Perel, author of Mating In Captivity and perhaps the world’s most in-demand relationship therapist, has turned her attention to workplaces in her new podcast, How’s Work?. As she notes, we increasingly ask our employers to take care of our emotional needs – terms like “trust”, “authenticity” and “belonging” have now entered the business sphere. Businesses organise mindfulness sessions your boss wants to know how you’re feeling. Meanwhile, romance is increasingly subject to the logic of the marketplace: we’re more inclined than ever to treat dates as job interviews. Judging from the responses of  readers, romance is very much alive, lustful and complicated in 2020. “I can’t remember who emailed who,” reports Polly, 39, an account director from Sheffield. “But an email was sent, waters were tested and within a couple of days we were snogging round the back of the office by the smoking shelter.” (The affair fizzled out after a couple of months: both were in other relationships.) Academia would appear to be a hotbed of brooding intensity: “My baby is the only positive thing to come out of it,” says Elisabeth, 27, an administrator from Manchester. City law firms (long hours, small teams, high pressure) sound particularly steamy. “When they installed a sleeping pod in the office it really got quite bad,” reports a former employee of one eminent firm.The majority of respondents told heart-warming stories that began with something like: “He made me find the dull drudge of each day amusing” (Rachel, 26, a researcher from London), and concluded along the lines of: “That was 40 years ago and next year we celebrate our ruby anniversary!” (Michael, 64, a retired civil servant from Chesterfield). There was plenty of heartache, too. “She worked for the sales director, I was in marketing, and every time I saw her my stomach turned somersaults,” says Andrew, 60, from Wales, who managed to keep his affair secret. “Never had that before or since. She was the love of my life.” She transferred abroad and Andrew considered jacking it all in to join her, but in the end chose his career. “I hope she’s reading this,” he adds.Then there are those for whom the sheer messiness of office romance is the whole point. Abigail, 48, a civil servant from Oxfordshire, reflects that her “romantic dalliances” have made for the happiest times in her work life. “No, I never got the big promotion or any recognition for how awesome I am, and more than once someone else has taken the credit for the work I’ve done,” she says. “I really don’t mind, because while they’ve been focusing on their careers, I’ve been preoccupied with infatuation, love and heartbreak.” She tallies one unrequited “major crush”, two stray snogs, three sexual relationships, two serious long-term relationships, one marriage and one broken heart from her civil service career. “These are the people I spent most of my time with – of course I’m going to develop real feelings for some of them,” she reasons. “The secret to my success? A friendly smile and a key to the stationery cupboard.”In those first weeks, she says, her rights as an employee were the last thing on her mind. Her main concern was spending as much time with Christine as possible. She took on extra work so she had an excuse to contact her over weekends. She took up jogging so she could exercise with Christine, and accepted an invitation to karaoke with her boss and her girlfriend. She enjoyed the status their closeness gave her. Best of all, they got to travel together: Tokyo, Beijing and Singapore. “We became reliant on each other,” she says. “Most of our work is in China, but I don’t really know Mandarin so I needed to stick with Christine to order food and get around. But she also needed me to help with filming schedules and castings and everything.” It was at these times that Jenny got to know “her secrets and fears”.Then, last January, came the shoot in China. As usual, the two of them flew out before the rest of the team to make sure everything was in place. “We had been out for dinner at this hotpot restaurant, a very traditional place, noisy, busy, full of smoke. We were drinking beer, eating boiled pig intestines and talking about religion. Like: what do we think happens when we die? Do we believe in reincarnation? All these deep topics.”Christine had told her that she had never instigated any of her romantic relationships – it had always been the other woman. Jenny took this to mean that she would have to make the move. But what if it went wrong? She considered resigning so that she could declare her love. But then she would lose her job and, potentially, Christine. Finally, they ended up at the hotel. “We were waiting outside the door and our eyes met and we just kind of stared at each other.”Power is sexy, work is dull and other people are more interesting. The writers of romances have always known this. But what would a human resources director make of, say, the film Secretary, in which Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a woman whose boss subjects her to what, from a 2020 perspective, looks like a clearcut case of sustained workplace harassment: whips, manacles, king? The US author Mary Gaitskill, who wrote the story on which the 2002 movie was based, returned to its themes in her recent novel This Is Pleasure, in which a powerful New York publisher faces a lawsuit from a former employee. He thought their king episode was a bit of transgressive fun. Years later, the employee thinks otherwise. In a recent interview with the , Gaitskill defended her decision to tell the story from the perspective of the accused on the grounds that the media has been full of accusers’ stories. “The thing about the bigger story,” she said, “is that you see the currents, but you often don’t see people really feeling it.”If you put any group of people together, pretty soon feelings will surface. “I’m a quiet and shy guy,” says Haroon, 35, from Bury. “I don’t tend to socialise much. I started my new job and on my first day this beautiful blond woman walks into my office and introduces herself. She is in her late 40s and married she talks a lot and loves to socialise. We hit it off as soon as our eyes locked.” He describes how she brings him out of his comfort zone, makes him feel confident and sexy. She often comes into his office to chat. He hasn’t made a move – and nor does he intend to. “Instead she is relegated to a fantasy,” he says. “My wife roleplays her when we have sex, not knowing I have a real crush on her.”Kimi, 51, a university lecturer from Scotland, says: “We got together in the most cliched circumstance – getting drunk at the work Christmas meal. We both had very young children and spouses who starved us of physical affection and intimacy. That was almost 18 years ago.” They are still together now – a “tacit couple”, long past the point of gossip. But they are also still with their respective spouses.“We sometimes manage to go to the same conferences,” Kimi says, “but mostly we have lunch and do the crossword puzzle, or meet for a drink and a game of cards. Our love affair has been largely conducted in writing, but we still miss each other when we don’t see each other for a few days.” She says they are more in love than ever, the most loyal friends, but that it’s bittersweet, trying to make the best of things, waiting for their children to grow up and leave. “We furnish imaginary flats and talk about the future. But I fear that when it comes to it, I won’t have the nerve to leave my husband.”Jenny and Christine didn’t kiss. Christine said something about the hard day they both faced in the morning, and Jenny said yes, and they went to their separate rooms. “And the next day we went back to work.”Jenny has just marked her first anniversary at the company. Over time, it has become easier. “I have given it a lot of thought and decided that it’s better to stay friends for life then be lovers for a short time,” she says. But she maintains that it’s her boss who helped her discover her sexuality. “I’m at peace now, I guess. It’s not nice to obsess. But now I’m happy. I feel so much freer. I’m more willing to try new things and meet more people. I’ve started using Tinder and Bumble. And I’ve been to my first Pride – that was quite special.”Christine – to the best of Jenny’s knowledge – has no idea of the role she has played in her younger colleague’s life. “But I don’t mind keeping it a secret,” Jenny says. “I’m very grateful to her. She is someone I will remember for a long time.”• Some names have been changed.If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2ba2ac638db55c169edee69d4f0883530873dbc/0_326_5594_3356/master/5594.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=529e9f2c0101bb5399bf51e386866784","title":"quiz cardiac smooth skeletal seabird sirius thomas eaton","story":"From a seabird to Sirius, test your knowledge with the Weekend quiz1 Who wrote the UK’s three bestselling books of the last decade?2 Which footballer was known as the non-flying Dutchman?3 What was last held in London in the winter of 1814?4 Which seabird is named from a French form of William?5 Eileen Collins was the first woman to command what craft?6 What starts with H and ends in Og?7 A rock off County Cork is the midpoint of which yacht race?8 Where did pilgrims eat on the Street of Bad Cooking?What links:9 AngusLaura BernardLydia CarrieHamish CharlesHenrietta Gareth?10 Cardiac smooth skeletal?11 Ain’t Misbehavin’ Blueberry Hill The Twist Praise You?12 Pie Oreo Nougat Marshmallow Lollipop Cupcake?13 Sirius Canopus Rigil Kentaurus Arcturus Vega?14 Buckingham Regent’s BPP Arden?15 Portugal South Korea Ghana Egypt Peru?1 EL James (Fifty Shades trilogy). 2 Dennis Bergkamp. 3 Frost fair on the Thames. 4 Guillemot (Guillaume). 5 Space shuttle (Columbia, 1999). 6 Periodic table (hydrogen and oganesson).7 Fastnet race. 8 Medieval Jerusalem (Rue de Malquisinat). 9 The titular four weddings a funeral, in the 1994 film. 10 Types of muscle in the human body. 11 Hits for stoutly-named musicians: Fats Waller Fats Domino Chubby Checker Fatboy Slim. 12 Versions of the Android smartphone operating system. 13 Brightest stars in the night sky. 14 Private universities in Britain. 15 Home countries of recent UN secretaries general: António Guterres Ban Ki-moon Kofi Annan Boutros Boutros-Ghali Javier Pérez de Cuéllar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5671e444c02fcf437f3ea0e312baa09629b64f91/0_1533_3921_2352/master/3921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31eedc79be2de20c2cacf65adfda1a7a","title":"restoration dramas inside the world of conservation artists","story":"Naval figureheads, ancient art and even Spitting Image puppets are all being brought back to life by a team of crack conservatorsThere is a lot of talk about “loss” in the studio of Hans Thompson and Maxwell Malden. As art conservators, this is traditionally what they deal in: missing pieces that range in size, shape and form. Today, it’s a small chip of plastic from a conceptual sculpture belonging to a contemporary art gallery. Tomorrow, it’s the gilded oak finger of a 17th-century sculpture of St Catherine. Each “loss” comes with a fresh set of practical and ethical challenges.Thompson and Malden founded their studio, Orbis Conservation, in 2013. The pair met at Goldsmiths and both went on to study conservation at City \u0026amp Guilds of London Art School. “We’d always worked together on freelance jobs,” says Malden, who worked as a gallery technician from the age of 17. “We knew we’d work together at some point. We just didn’t think it would happen quite as quickly.”The pair operate out of a workshop – a cavernous brick building – on an industrial estate in Greenwich, south London, flanked by car mechanics and skip-hire companies. Their work includes the restoration and redisplay of public sculptures and monuments, including the Eduardo Paolozzi mosaics at Tottenham Court Road tube station in London, and the 5,000-year-old neolithic carved Calder Stones in Liverpool. They also specialise in the material analysis and restoration of historic interiors, contemporary artworks – and just about everything in between.The team has recently completed their biggest commission to date: six 19th-century wooden figureheads from British naval warships, destined for display in the Box gallery and museum, a new heritage and arts complex in Plymouth due to open on 16 May. Plymouth council’s vision for the restored figureheads was to suspend them from the ceiling. The challenge for Orbis was twofold. They needed to stabilise the badly degraded figureheads, and devise a display system that would safely suspend this surreal flotilla of 2-tonne sculptures. Fortunately, Thompson and Malden’s experience in the art industry stood them in good stead.“As art technicians, Hans and I both had years of experience before we became conservators,” Malden explains. “If you come to conservation blind and you’re suddenly given a 14th-century marble head to work on, you don’t even want to touch it. We’d already spent years moving that kind of stuff around…”The solution they devised was for the mount-making to became part of the conservation process: the restored pieces of the sculpture were slowly rebuilt around a new, integral steel bracket that would connect with a suspension system on the gallery ceiling. It was a process that took two years and called upon a full range of traditional and technical conservation skills.Kirsty Walsh, a conservator at Orbis who specialises in paint and decorative surfaces, recalls the arrival of one of the first figureheads, Defiance, a bearded, classical warrior that was commissioned in 1859. “When he first came in, I think that was the closest I’ve come to thinking, this is just not possible. Every little bit of him was crumbling away. He was falling apart in our hands.”Another, Topaze – a regal female bust commissioned in 1856 – was so badly damaged that water simply poured from the fibreglass shell she had been encased in, in a misguided effort to preserve her in the 1960s. The studio used a technique called sonic tomography to assess the internal water damage of the solid, wooden figureheads. “We positioned nails around the circumference of each statue at regular intervals and sent sound waves between the nails. The speed at which the sound waves travel dictates the density of the wood, which suggests the degree of rot that has set in,” says Malden.Having established the stability of each structure, consolidants were injected into the pine for up to five months. While the wood was being stabilised, Walsh was conducting microscopic studies of paint samples in her first-floor lab, which overlooks the workshop below.The lab is where Walsh undertakes finer conservation work. On the day I visit, it contains an incongruous gathering of projects. Alongside a conceptual sculpture from the 1980s and a 17th-century saint are pieces from the Parliamentary Art Collection. Walsh taps on a wooden freight crate. “We’ve got David Steel in here. I’m going to start working on him tomorrow. Charles Kennedy’s head is over there.” They are, of course, latex Spitting Image puppets that have started to degrade. Walsh used microscopy to conduct paint analysis of the figureheads. Under the microscope, she shows me a cross-section of a fragment of paint taken from King Billy (a figurehead of William IV from 1833). She describes how she set the flake in resin before polishing it and placing it under the lens. The results show an undulating stratum of paints: modern blues and reds, interrupted by layers of filler and dirt, with layers of historic lead white paint at the bottom. With the use of a scanning electron microscope, Walsh is able to read the shapes of the cellular particles in the paint, which enables her to date the historic layers more precisely.Walsh’s findings raised the question of how far back in the object’s history the restoration process should go. “As far as we could see, it was a fact that these objects were repeatedly painted in layers of lead white paint,” says Malden. “But today, figureheads are recognised as colourful objects – we might have had a bit of explaining to do if the whole collection was painted white…”It’s a lively argument that Malden and Thompson embrace head-on in their progressive practice, which is increasingly looking at the role of conservation in contemporary art. “We’ve always worked with living artists, and we’re interested in where contemporary art is going, and how conservation is going to fit into that,” says Malden.Currently in the lab is a piece by the contemporary artist Samara Scott who makes sculptures from everyday materials – plastic bags, bleach, glitter, toothpaste. “Over time, her pieces start to morph,” explains Malden. These material choices can pose problems for galleries and collectors.To ensure the longevity of Scott’s work, Orbis is drawing up a database of the objects she uses, making it easier for her to be more selective with her material choices. Malden is quick to point out that the intention is never to “stifle” the artist’s choices – it’s more a case of working out at what point in the creative process conservation become a consideration.The studio are now keen to forge links with upcoming artists and have recently announced a residency programme for spring 2020. Orbis is offering studio space to an artist who is grappling with a particular engineering or material challenge. The idea is to explore how conservators can fit “harmoniously” within the artistic process. The intention is to keep art alive for longer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a0f6ef20c59bb2edec50776fe221af19be5a47/104_0_3661_2197/master/3661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=359bf46a62a342b7d47a13f63d5999f7","title":"zero evidence worse for children parenting in polyamorous relationship","story":"We’ve decided to allow other partners into our lives. There is just one problem: how to square that with having a familyAlmost three years ago, my partner and I decided to experiment with opening up our relationship. More recently, we’ve “come out” as polyamorous, meaning we are free to be involved with more than one person at a time, physically andor emotionally, in a transparent, consensual way.In practice, this means that I currently have a wife, who I live with, along with our two-year-old son. I also have a girlfriend, who lives elsewhere and has a daughter. I love both my wife and my girlfriend deeply, in different ways. My wife has a new male love interest, also living elsewhere, also with children.It is a little complex, but it needn’t be horrifying. Yet when I tell people about the recent change to our 11-year relationship, I’m usually met with fear and confusion. That’s understandable, perhaps open non-monogamy remains a relatively uncommon choice and comes with its fair share of upsets and hurt feelings. At times I, too, have felt some fear and confusion. But it’s hard being judged by others for making a considered adult choice. The biggest anxiety our situation raises, it seems, is that we’re parents. The overwhelming suspicion seems to be that our child will either be exposed to a dangerous level of eroticism, or somehow miss out on attention, stability and love.It is remarkably similar to some of the hysteria conjured by religious and political zealots around same-sex parenting back in the 1980s. Still, I’m sympathetic. Having entered the brave new world of conscious non-monogamy only in the past few years, I, too, am unravelling decades of social conditioning that suggest open relationships are OK-ish (a bit bohemian juvenile even), provided there aren’t children involved. Children need consistency, right? But does consistency have to mean monogamy?In many ways, polyamorous couples face the same challenges or rewards as blended families where orced parents remarry. Mancub, 16, is the child of polyamorous parents living in Northamptonshire, whom he quite simply calls “my adults”: Cassie (his mum), Josh (his dad) and Amanda (their partner). “Even at a young age, I was able to grasp the concept that my mum and dad could love more than one person,” he says. “The only thing I’ve found challenging about having three adults in my family is getting away with things, because it means more people to check up on you, to make sure you did your chores. But I also have more people around to give me lifts here and there, to help with homework and to come to my lacrosse games. The saying ‘raised by a village’ definitely applies to me. I feel like a completely normal teenager, just with polyamorous parents.”This kind of positive response is not uncommon. Researcher and relationship coach Dr Eli Sheff is author of The Polyamorists Next Door: Inside Multiple-Partner Relationships And Families, which details 15 years of studying polyamorous families. This includes interviews with 206 people in polyamorous families in the US, 37 of them children.“Looking at these kids overall, I would say that they are equally – if not more – emotionally healthy than their peers,” Sheff says. “The kids from poly families are pros at establishing new relationships. They’ve been growing up marinated in personal growth and honesty, and exposed to a wide range of ideas. They don’t necessarily think they’ll be polyamorous themselves, particularly since most grow up in an environment designed to foster independent thought.” Though my wife and I have no plans to live with any other partner, we will continue to be cautious about how and when we introduce our son to significant others. In my view, he has certainly benefited from the presence of my girlfriend: the pair have a touchingly close relationship she was the first person ever to babysit him (when my wife and I went out for a date) and as a trained actress and born storyteller, she’s definitely his favourite when it comes to bedtime stories.I’m acutely aware that our son will soon know himself to be different from the norm, since he has two mothers (and a donor, whom our son hasn’t met, though my wife and I maintain contact because we like him, and in case our son wishes to contact him when he is older). I have worried at times: will he feel vulnerable because his parents have veered away from the traditional paradigm?At the moment, it isn’t a pressing concern the things that matter most to him right now are ice-cream, trains, and refusing to wear pyjamas. As he grows, however, it will become important to answer his questions in an age-appropriate way. “This can mean using terms like ‘special friend’ or ‘sleepover’, but doesn’t mean avoiding the truth,” says Dr Lori Beth Bisbey, a London-based psychologist and practising polyamorist. “If your child asks why he has two mums, you’d answer that question directly, so don’t be any different about your relationship status. For those adults in your life who are freaking out about your choices, you can ask them whether they think that it’s possible to love more than one child, and explain how loving more than one partner is much like that.”Secrets and lies – these are things that ought, ideally, to be eradicated in poly relationships, although in practice humans are still, well, human. Having been traditionally unfaithful and openly polyamorous, I know that my self-respect and inner contentment are far higher in the latter scenario. In consciously open relationships, the idea of infidelity is less clear cut, and becomes an agreement between two (or more) people. “Cheating” can still happen, when trust is broken: going on a date without telling the other partner, for instance, or lying about one’s intensifying feelings towards another partner. On the whole, however, there is much less dishonesty or evasion than in more monogamous setups, which arguably results in fewer acrimonious breakups.We won’t know the impact of our choices until our son can articulate it. When the time comes, I intend to listen, allowing him to express his ideas or complaints. I hope to take great care of any part of our bond that might have been overstretched somehow by my mistakes or actions, though I have zero intention of foisting details of my sex life on him. What I might say, instead, is that I don’t believe in sublimating all my own needs merely because I’ve become a parent. I think that doing so can lead to greater problems, and I want to show him that it is possible to get most of one’s own needs met openly and responsibly, while also loving someone else – including one’s child.Once he is old enough to understand, I’ll also tell him this: my relationship with his mother has strengthened since we allowed each other to be attracted to, or fall in love with, other people. That’s not to say it has been easy (hell no: the opposite). But ultimately it has been worth it, because the freer we are to look elsewhere, the freer we are to choose each other. My wife and I are more honest and less co-dependent than we have ever been in our 11 years together. I believe our son is more likely to grow up with two parents who love one another, and are committed to one another.

Yet boomers built the world we live in today, for worse but also for betterOne of the cruellest ironies of being a teenager is that the attitude you reckon makes you look the most grown up is the one that proves you are definitely still a child. There are few things more adorably infantile than the wholesale dismissal of one’s parents as idiotic know-nothings compared with you, the all-knowing fount of wisdom, albeit one who still needs her parents to drive her everywhere. I once got into an enormous huff with my parents because they dismissed Eurotrash – the much-missed (by me) Channel 4 show – as “stupid”. AS IF! Objectively, they were wrong: as TV shows predicated on laughing at other countries go, Eurotrash was amazing. It never occurred to me that my parents had led lives before me, ones in which they did things that my potato-like 15-year-old brain could not even begin to fathom. My father had lived abroad my mother had worked with Jim Henson both received far more higher education than I did. And still, I rolled my eyes and told them they knew “nothing”.The younger generation has to disown the older one in order to break away from it. I see this in my own kids – already, at the age of four, dab hands at the keenly deployed eye roll. And I hear it every time someone sneeringly dismisses “a boomer”, anyone born between 1946 and 1964, or “a second waver”, a feminist who came of age in the 1960s and 70s. There’s even a genre of literature about it, with calm and measured titles such as A Generation Of Sociopaths: How The Babyboomers Betrayed America. Meanwhile, the much-discussed “OK, boomer” meme is chucked at anyone, whenever they were born, who expresses an opinion deemed unforgivably out of step with the times. I am not a boomer, but I’ll be frankly insulted if this column doesn’t earn me a few “OK, boomer” emails.Yes, boomers had it pretty great, and look at this (literally) hot mess of a planet they’ve left us. To make it worse – and this, clearly, is the real source of anti-boomer ire – they then complain about how easy those avocado-eating millennials have it. Or, putting it into the kind of context I can easily understand, it’s like the dorky parents in an 80s movie telling their way cooler teenager that he should be grateful for his meagre allowance, when they have a massive car and hang out all day at the country club. No wonder that teenager has a party and trashes the house. It’s what the parents deserve!And yet boomers built the world we live in today, for worse but also for better. True, Donald Trump is a boomer but so are Steve Jobs, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, Madonna, Stephen King and Bill Gates. And although the figureheads of the civil rights movement and second-wave feminism – Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem – were born before the boom, it was the boomers who went on the marches, because, as millennials and Gen Zers know, it is the young who agitate for and effect social change.Plenty of the lieutenants in these movements were born during the boom – Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon among them. Some of their views might not find favour with the young women who today consider porn empowering and sex work liberating Dworkin was not exactly known for her “sex positivity”. But it was MacKinnon who first drafted what became the law against workplace sexual harassment.There is a tendency in feminism that will always – ironically – want to kill its mother figures. Every new wave has defined itself in opposition to the one that came before, and I never hear any reference to “the second wavers” today that isn’t critical. Feminist-lite website Jezebel claimed in 2018 that “The Backlash To #MeToo Is Second-wave Feminism”. Never mind that this isn’t even true (I’m pretty sure Dworkin, for one, would have been down with #MeToo) the point was, as it always is, that these old people don’t understand anything. It’s an argument that’s since been levelled against Obama, when he dared to suggest that “we can’t completely remake society in a minute”, earning the first black American president some swift “OK, boomer” dismissals and Oprah Winfrey, who last week made the mistake of recommending the much-discussed new novel American Dirt, by Jeanine Cummins, which has been accused of cultural appropriation.Part of growing up is learning that your elders are fallible. But a bigger part is seeing them fully, their weaknesses but also their strengths. Because as any therapist will tell you, sitting around and blaming your parents for everything doesn’t get you far, and trashing your house just means you live in a mess. Generational ides, aside from being cliched, accomplish less than nothing, as the last general election in this country proved. Maybe Obama (winner of two elections) might actually have some insights into how you sway mass opinion maybe that most reviled of British boomers, Tony Blair (winner of three), might, too. In a world where newness is all, and your every device is telling you to update to the latest version, it’s easy to forget that sometimes there are older stories worth learning from.Gosh darn it, kids, go upstairs and do your damn homework!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60684842570c8a120aa6cddbad7909b0901a9511/0_37_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=551bea1e5d941c2818161bdedcdfe140","title":"are you a woman who has experienced insolvency in later life","story":"If you have been insolvent over the age of 65, we would like to hear from youAccording to the government’s Insolvency Service, the number of personal insolvencies in England and Wales climbed to a nine-year high last year.We’d like to hear from women who have had to face insolvency.

Compelling as this sounds, the story has a flaw: it may not be true. According to a leading Beethoven expert, the composer still had hearing in his left ear until shortly before his death in 1827.“This is going to send everybody scurrying to revise biographical concepts about Beethoven,” Theodore Albrecht, professor of musicology at Kent State University, Ohio, told the Observer. Albrecht, who has uncovered crucial evidence in contemporary accounts, believes that although Beethoven suffered severe deterioration in his hearing, he did not lose it “to the very profound depths” that musicologists have assumed.“Not only was Beethoven not completely deaf at the premiere of his Ninth Symphony in May 1824, he could hear, although increasingly faintly, for at least two years afterwards, probably through the last premiere that he would supervise, his String Quartet in B-flat, Op 130, in March 1826,” Albrecht said.Beethoven began to lose his hearing in 1798. “If I belonged to any other profession, it would be easier,” he told a friend, “but in my profession it is a frightful state.” Between 1812 and 1816, he tried ear trumpets, with little success. From 1818, he carried blank “conversation books”, in which friends and acquaintances jotted down comments, to which he would reply aloud.“The conversation books are going to be a game-changer,” Albrecht said. Among the surviving examples – two in the composer’s birthplace, the Beethoven-Haus museum in Bonn, and 137 in Berlin State Library – he has so far found 23 direct references to the subject of hearing, and estimates that several dozen more will show “he could still hear something”.Some musicologists suggest that, as his hearing worsened, Beethoven favoured lower and middle-range notes in his compositions and began to use high notes again only once he was totally deaf, drawing on memory and imagination. But, looking at the range of pitches used in the final complete symphony, Albrecht dismisses that theory: “I don’t think it holds. Otherwise, what do you do with the piccolo in the Ninth Symphony – up there on top – and the contrabasses down below? All the registers are there. He could hear them with his inner ear. He was amazing.”Albrecht is now editing the “conversation book” accounts and translating them from German into English for the first time, a mammoth publishing project that will eventually comprise 12 volumes.British company Boydell \u0026amp Brewer will publish volume 3 of Beethoven’s Conversation Books in May (£45), following the publication of some of the new research in an article entitled “The Hearing Beethoven”, in The Beethoven Journal this month and (in German) by the Vienna Oboe Journal in March. Covering the period from 1818 until the composer’s death, the books’ subjects range from music and politics to shopping lists and errands. Albrecht said that, although a scholarly German-language edition was begun in 1968, its format made it difficult to read and its contents had been misinterpreted. The English translation of this work has extensive footnotes on each page to help readers make sense of the evidence.He added that these “compelling conversations” will finally allow English-speaking music lovers to hear what Beethoven and his friends were discussing.Evidence proving that Beethoven could still hear “doesn’t take away from the fact that this man did what he did in the face of overwhelming difficulty”, he noted.2020 marks the 250th anniversary of the birth of one of the greatest composers of all time. The event will be marked by festivals and programmes across the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/616dbf199ff2caea8da84106c7510bbaa852f760/0_0_4201_2521/master/4201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6d941c13236c320297fa6a7dde69dd6","title":"from entry to exit what did eu membership mean for britain podcast","story":"John Palmer was the ’s correspondent in Brussels in 1973 when the UK entered the European Economic Community.

A triumph of dogged negotiation by May then, briefly, Johnson, has fulfilled the most pointless, masochistic ambition ever dreamed of in the history of these islands. The rest of the world, presidents Putin and Trump excepted, have watched on in astonishment and dismay. A majority voted in December for parties which supported a second referendum. But those parties failed lamentably to make common cause. We must pack up our tents, perhaps to the sound of church bells, and hope to begin the 15-year trudge, back towards some semblance of where we were yesterday with our multiple trade deals, security, health and scientific co-operation and a thousand other useful arrangements.We endured a numbing complicity between government and opposition. The door out of Europe was held open by Corbyn for Johnson to walk through. In this case, if you travelled far enough to the left, you met and embraced the right coming the other way.What did we learn in our blindness? That those not flourishing within the status quo had no good reason to vote for it that our prolonged parliamentary chaos derived from an ill-posed yes-no question to which there were a score of answers that the long-evolved ecology of the EU has profoundly shaped the flora of our nation’s landscape and to rip these plants out will be brutal that what was once called a hard Brexit became soft by contrast with the threatened no-deal that even now persists that any mode of departure, by the government’s own estimate, will shrink the economy that we have a gift for multiple and bitter ision – young against old, cities against the country, graduates against early school-leavers, Scotland and Northern Ireland against England and Wales that all past, present and future international trade deals or treaties are a compromise with sovereignty, as is our signature on the Paris accords, or our membership of Nato, and that therefore “Take Back Control” was the emptiest, most cynical promise of this sorry season.We surprised ourselves. Only a few years ago, asked to list the nation’s ills – wealth gap, ailing NHS, north-south imbalance, crime, terrorism, austerity, housing crisis etc – most of us would not have thought to include our membership of the EU. How happy we were in 2012, in the afterglow of our successful Olympics. We weren’t thinking then of Brussels. It was, in Guy Verhofstadt’s famous term, a “cat-fight” within the Tory party that got us going. Those cats had been fighting each other for decades. When they dragged us in and urged us to take sides, we had a collective nervous breakdown then sufficient numbers wanted the distress to go away and “get Brexit done”. Repeated ad nauseam by the prime minister it almost seemed impolite to ask why.In the early days of the referendum campaign we learned that “on the doorstep” it was all about migration but we also learned that it was the UK’s decision, not the EU’s, to allow unlimited migration from the accession countries before the permitted seven years were up it was the UK’s choice to allow EU migrants to stay more than six months without a job it was the UK that successfully campaigned to enlarge the EU eastwards it is the UK, not the EU, that lets non-EU migration continue (and why not?) as EU migration declines. We also learned that the UK, not the EU, opted for our maroon rather than patriotic blue passports. Though, as I look, my old passports seem almost black.There is much that is historically unjust about the British state, but very little of that injustice derives from the EU. Brussels didn’t insist that we neglect the post-industrial towns of the Midlands and the north or demand that we let wages stagnate, or permit multimillion handouts to the CEOs of failing companies, or prefer shareholder value over the social good, or run our health service, social care and Sure Start into the ground, close 600 police stations and let the fabric of our state schools decay.Hedge fund owners, plutocrat donors to the cause, Etonians and newspaper proprietors cast themselves as enemies of the elite. More magic dust. The claim that the Northern Ireland issue has been settled is a dangerous pretence. We have witnessed reasoned argument’s fall from grace. The Brexit impulse had strong elements of blood-and-soil, with hints of Empire nostalgia. Such spooky longings floated high above mere facts.We acquired an argot. “Article 50”, “frictionless trade”, “just in time”, “the backstop” – how they tripped off the tongue. We learned to respect an “invisible border”. Before it all began, only a very few knew the difference between the customs union and the single market. Three years on, not much has changed. A survey last year showed that quite a lot of us thought that “crashing out” was the same as remaining. If only.The Brexit leadership and the leader of the opposition were always in a hurry to start article 50’s two-year stopwatch. They feared that leave voters might change their minds, that those who didn’t vote last time were 2:1 for remaining, and that young voters coming on to the rolls would be mostly pro-EU. The Brexiter generals reasonably feared a second referendum.At least, we can all agree that we will be a bit poorer. As one of my school teachers used to say, if a thing is really worth doing, it’s worth doing badly. Theresa May could never bring herself to say that Brexit would make us better off. She wouldn’t even tell us if she would vote to leave in a second referendum. We should credit her honesty. By contrast, Boris Johnson, laying his post-Brexit vision before parliament, promised he would narrow the UK’s wealth and opportunity gap between north and south, and make it the home of cutting-edge battery technology. He forgot to mention that the EU never stood in the way of either project.Redefining our new trade relations with the EU will preoccupy us for years. As for the US position, take a long walk in the American midwest and you’ll go a month across a monoculture desert and not see a wildflower. To compete, our own agriculture would have to welcome the hormone hypodermic. Our farmers will need to est of inefficient hedgerows, boundary trees and three-metre field margins – museum pieces all. When it was in trade talks with the EU, the US wouldn’t contemplate higher standards of husbandry, food standards and environmental protection, even though they would have granted access to half a billion consumers. American farming corporations will not be changing their ways for a nation of a mere 65 million. If we want a deal, it is we who must downgrade.We sense damage and diminishment ahead. In a dangerous world crowded with loud-mouthed “strongmen”, the EU was our best hope for an open, tolerant, free and peaceful community of nations. Those hopes are already threatened as populist movements have swept across Europe. Our withdrawal will weaken resistance to the xenophobic tendency. The lesson of our nation’s history these past centuries is plain: turmoil in continental Europe will draw us into bloody conflicts. Nationalism is rarely a project for peace. Nor does it care to counter climate change. It prefers to let tropical forests and the Australian bush burn.Take a road trip from Greece to Sweden, from Portugal to Hungary. Leave your passport behind. What a rich, teeming bundle of civilisations – in food, manners, architecture, language, and each nation state profoundly and proudly different from its neighbours. No evidence of being under the boot-heel of Brussels. Nothing here of continental USA’s dreary commercial sameness. Summon everything you’ve learned of the ruinous, desperate state of Europe in 1945, then contemplate a stupendous economic, political and cultural achievement: peace, open borders, relative prosperity, and the encouragement of inidual rights, tolerance and freedom of expression. Until Friday this was where our grown-up children went at will to live and work.That’s over, and for now the force is with English nationalism. Its champion is Johnson’s Vote Leave cabinet whose monument will forever be a special kind of smirk, perfected back in the days of the old Soviet Union. I’m lying, you know I’m lying and I know that you know and I don’t give a damn. As in, “The five-week prorogation of parliament has nothing to do with Brexit.” Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg were masters of the mocking grin. The supreme court’s inconvenient judgment that this prorogation was illegal clearly still rankles. Recently, the ex-home secretary Michael Howard was set on to murmur against the judges. Extending political control over an independent judiciary would be consonant with the Johnson-Cummings project. Victor Orbán of Hungary lights the way.The remainers held out for a kinder sort of world, but we were always the herbivores in this debate, with our enormous, good-natured and derided marches – “a hate-filled crowd”, the Sun “an elite”, the Daily . If 16 million remainers are an elite, then we may rejoice that the UK is a model of meritocracy.We were, in truth, the left-behinds. By the grace of Corbyn and his grim lieutenants, we had no effective voice in parliament. On her first day as prime minister, Theresa May promised outside No 10 that she would govern for us all. Instead, she threw half the country to the dogs to appease her party’s right wing. Initially, Boris Johnson’s elevation was decided by a tiny, ageing constituency, the majority of whose members told pollsters that they wished Donald Trump ruled Britain and that they longed for the return of hanging. In similar spirit, Johnson found fresh depths of populist vulgarity when he spoke last June of pitchforking the EU incubus off the nation’s back. He has realised his dream.As for the outer extremes, the occasional milkshake aside, we never violently assaulted a Brexiter in the street we only rarely inclined to sending anonymous death and rape threats such as came so abundantly the way of Gina Miller, Anna Soubry and many female MPs. However, the antisemitic emails from within the Labour party were a disgrace. So too was the bullying mob jeering outside the Rees-Mogg home. But we remainers did not slyly exhort our compatriots to riot in the event of a second referendum going against us. Nearly two-thirds of the electorate did not vote to leave most of business and the trade unions, agriculture, science, finance and the arts were against the Brexit project three-quarters of MPs voted to remain. But our representatives ignored the evident public interest and shrank behind party cabals and “the people have spoken” – that bleak Soviet locution – followed by “get Brexit done”, the mind-clouding magic dust which has blinded reason and diminished our children’s prospects.• This article was updated on 1 February 2020 to its correct version an earlier version having been published in error."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea3bec7743ce37ebc1b5e19569be43cd9aba3498/0_181_4635_2781/master/4635.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=480a8f1523545b8631ea391ef66ac345","title":"britain retrenched island europe papers react to brexit day","story":"The European press marks the UK’s first day outside the EU with sorrow, bewilderment and resolution• Brexit: Britain wakes up to uncertain future – live newsEurope’s media greeted the bright new post-Brexit dawn of Britain’s first day as an ex-member of the European Union with some sadness, a healthy dose of scepticism, and a plea to the the bloc to get its act together.“The end,” wrote France’s Libération. “Britain has left the EU and there’s not much else to say. After 47 years at the heart of a unique club of nations, after three years and seven months of drama, plot twists and chaos, it is out, retrenched on its island, alone.”The end was a bit of a damp squib, the paper said. Most people “did nothing, seeking a normal Friday evening without too many questions about what comes next. Brexit and its consequences have only just begun. Tomorrow is another day, Brexited.”Le Monde said 31 January was “the day nothing changed, and everything changed”. The Parliament Square crowd “vanished minutes after singing God Save the Queen, with no hanging around – in keeping with a strange day when Britain celebrated a truly historic event, but only barely. Can one really celebrate a orce?”It was as if everyone somehow sensed that the farewell formalities – “that moment when you find yourself on the pavement, at once relieved and saddened, before everyone heads their separate ways” – had to be kept as brief as possible.In Germany’s Süddeutsche Zeitung, Stefan Kornelius warned that “no country was an island, not even Britain”. Sovereignty is “a popular term in an era crying out for order and security,” he wrote. “But it assumes you are the master of your destiny – that you can ward off unreasonable demands from the outside world.”This was “a nice idea in a world that has created huge dependencies”, Kornelius said. “The song is of an end to vassalage and humiliation, but Britain has no great ideas for the future … so far, all we have seen been a narrow-minded denial of reality and a trivialisation of the problems.”Die Welt warned of the consequences of Brexit-fuelled delusions of grandeur, saying much would depend on “whether British politics, after Brexit, can finally be honest about the country’s true size”. It quoted the prophetic words of a government scientific adviser, Henry Tizard, in 1949.“We persist in regarding ourselves as a great power, capable of everything and only temporarily handicapped by economic difficulties,” Tizard wrote, in a memo instantly filed away. “We are not a great power and never will be again. We are a great nation, but if we continue to behave like a great power we shall soon cease to be a great nation.”Spain’s El País said Boris Johnson now faced “a challenge of colossal dimensions: to recover the unity of a country ided between those who see Brexit as a liberation, and those who consider it a tragedy and a historical error”.He will also need to finally define Brexit, and in doing so risks, despite his large majority, “reigniting another old war: that between free trade fans, who aspire to break completely with the EU’s rules, and those who in the coming months will start to see the consequences of Brexit for farmers, fishermen and businesses”.In the Netherlands, Caroline de Gruyter warned that the EU needed to get moving. “Until now, Brexit has been good for the EU,” she wrote in NRC Handelsblad. Polls, she said, show public appreciation of the EU and the euro at their highest levels ever.“The 27 are united. That earns admiration from citizens. Europeans were shocked to see the UK sink into political chaos, and to hear talk of food and medicine shortages under a no-deal Brexit they concluded it is better to stay together. You no longer hear populists like Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders talk about Frexit or Nexit.”But it would be “naive to assume things will stay that way”, De Gruyter said. “Just as the EU benefits from a disastrous Brexit, a successful Brexit can undermine the EU … as the former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi said … the EU project ‘must be given a new impetus. Brussels must start moving: ideas, dreams, soul. It’s time.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/834c47739a606f6dcf61278945ba4565169618fe/0_139_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9cedc741a15280a9d3e3bc848d711a0","title":"lisa nandy honours system british excellence","story":"Labour leadership contender says system should bring people together, not shut them outThe Labour leadership contender Lisa Nandy has backed removing references to the British empire in the honours system, saying it should recognise “British excellence” instead.At a hustings in Bristol on Saturday, Nandy said the honours system should be a tool to bring people together, rather than shut them out.“That is the country I want to build, and the Labour party I will lead. That never accepts the world as it is but builds the world as it should be. As Benjamin Zephaniah asked: ‘What happened to the verse of fire?’ We can be far more ambitious.”The move by Nandy is the latest pledge by leadership candidates designed to appeal to Labour’s leftwing membership, which expanded hugely under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. Nandy’s pledge came as leadership contenders clashed over the selection of Labour MPs – an issue that has regularly caused isions.Rebecca Long-Bailey, the candidate closest to Corbyn, reiterated her pledge to bring in open selections if she was elected leader, a move that would in effect allow local Labour activists to deselect their MP. She said being an MP was “not a job for life”. However, she was confronted by Nandy, who warned against focusing on the internal power struggles within the party. “The MPs I want to get rid of are Tories, not Labour,” Nandy said.The candidates also clashed over Brexit during the first hustings event since Britain’s departure from the EU. Long-Bailey and Nandy called on the party to accept Brexit and move on. However, the pro-remain shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, who still lacks the necessary grassroots support to appear on the leadership ballot paper, said the bumpy negotiations ahead meant Labour needed a leader who had been “on the right side of the argument all along”.Long-Bailey said the party’s next election campaign must not be based on “we told you so” over the dangers of Brexit. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, who helped steer Labour towards backing a second referendum, said the debate around leave or remain was over. However, he accused the government of failing to tackle the issues that led to the Brexit vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/583ae0064f2cc9da9e03f72f4cb588943ce11e8b/519_214_1827_1096/master/1827.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=407195855510c43c009c1d985a9e8085","title":"david cameron accounts brexit vote 2016","story":"Former prime minister’s company accounts are made public on UK’s final day in EUDavid Cameron has made more than £1.6m since he quit as prime minister following the Brexit vote in 2016.The accounts for the Office of David Cameron, which were made public on the UK’s final day as a member of the European Union, show that he made £836,168 in the year to 30 April 2019.The previous year’s accounts show a profit of £790,274 with his total earnings since the company was established reaching £1.63m.The accounts do not provide detail on how much the former prime minister has been making from speaking engagements, and book and other media deals, but they do show that an investment property valued at £128,190 was bought last April.

With a lump in its throat and a poignant song of farewell – or with cheers and a raised middle finger of defiant good riddance? The answer that Britain gave at 11pm on Friday 31 January 2020 was: both. The UK broke from the European Union on a late winter’s night with both jubilation and regret, as ided on the day of leaving as it had been in deciding to leave. For some Britons, this was Independence Day. For others, it was a national bereavement.In Westminster, Nigel Farage exulted with his fellow Brexiters in Parliament Square, delighted that a prize they had sought for a quarter century, and that once seemed laughably improbable, was in their hands at last. “We did it,” he told the ecstatic crowd. “We transformed the landscape of our country.” At the stroke of 11pm, he led a chorus of the national anthem.In Downing Street, a countdown clock had beamed on to the outside walls as if impatient for the moment, like children waiting for Christmas. Inside, Boris Johnson – who had been the face and totem of the Vote Leave campaign of 2016 – hailed “the dawn of a new era”, the curtain going up on “a new act in our great national drama”. Surrounded by cabinet colleagues and veterans of the referendum campaign, the prime minister toasted their success with English sparkling wine, washing down a Brexit day feast of roast beef, Yorkshire pudding and Shropshire blue cheese, a spread pointedly free of the taint of the dreaded continent. Along the Mall, union jacks fluttered brightly.There was merch for those who wanted it: you could buy a Got Brexit Done tea-towel, perhaps using a handful of commemorative Brexit 50p pieces. If you were in Morley, you could join Andrea Jenkyns’ Big Brexit Bash, to celebrate what the Yorkshire MP called an end to “a hellish four years” and the start of what was sure to be “a golden decade”, with Britons at last in charge of their own destiny, free of the shackles of Brussels. Sunderland, first to declare for leave in 2016, had the joy of hosting a special Brexit day meeting of the cabinet.Melancholy was the mood of a procession on Friday afternoon from Downing Street to the London offices of the European commission, staged, the organisers said, “to say goodbye to our old friend”. Clad in blue and gold, they numbered just a few hundred: hard to believe that a million or more marched in their cause a matter of months ago. In Frome, Somerset, they gathered for a late-night vigil at an installation known as the European Community of Stones, a semi-circular henge of 12 boulders, one quarried from each of the EU’s 12 members when it was built in 1992. They sang the EU anthem, Ode to Joy, in recognition of the “sense of excitement, of opportunity, the EU represented”, said local Green party councillor Martin Dimery. For him, the EU was “the greatest international project for peace, prosperity and progress”, and now Britain will play no part in it. What was the point of a ceremony to mark that fact? “Every death deserves a funeral.”That elegiac quality has been a constant note sounded through these final days of UK membership, expressed most intensely in that widely shared footage of the European parliament rising to its feet to sing Auld Lang Syne to a departing Britain (confirming this is a wrench for them as well as us). It was the sadness of saying goodbye not to an institution, but to an idea – of friendship across the sea, of harmony between nations, of a resolve that a continent riven by the bloodiest of wars would live out its future in peace.So while Downing Street had its clock, remainers had a projection of their own: a film beamed on to the white cliffs of Dover, featuring two veterans of the second world war, both in their 90s, speaking of their sadness at the coming of this hour. They would miss the “comradeship” of the European Union, they said, adding the hope that “we will be back together before too long”. The film, the work of the Led by Donkeys group, ended with an image of a single gold star from the European flag. “This is our star,” said the message. “Look after it for us.”And that was the plea contained in so many remainer goodbyes, the hope that this is not forever. That afternoon procession in Whitehall was headlined “À bientôt EU, see you soon.” A departing Scottish MEP asked the EU 27 “to leave a light on, so we can find our way home.”The Royal Society of Literature posted an image from AA Milne: Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, hand in hand, walking into the sunset, above the caption, “But, of course, it isn’t really Good-bye, because the Forest will always be there… and anybody who is Friendly with Bears can find it.”Farage was having none of that, of course. “Once we have left we are never coming back and the rest is detail,” he had said, in his parting shot to the European parliament, before, in a metaphor made flesh, he had his microphone cut off by the chair: Brexit party MEPs had broken parliamentary rules by waving union jack flags. “Put your flags away … and take them with you,” the chair said. “You are leaving.”So for all Johnson’s talk of healing, there was no agreement between leave and remain at the moment of parting – except on one thing. Both saw 11pm as chiming in an epochal shift in the history of these islands. True, nothing material altered at that moment. The UK that wakes up on Saturday will still have to stick to EU rules and pay into the EU budget, albeit without any say, until 31 December. Britons can still go through the EU citizens line at the airport. Things will only get real on the first day of 2021.In that sense, 11pm ushered in a period of Brexit nirvana for Boris Johnson. For the next 11 months, he will have the best of both worlds: he can say he’s got Brexit done, and enjoy the benefits of EU membership. All the political gain, with none of the economic pain. Truly, he will have his cake and eat it.Still, leaving the EU marks the biggest change in our national life since 1973, when Britain joined, if not since 1945, given that today’s EU is so much larger and more significant than the Common Market of 47 years ago. The new political landscape will be wholly different. The pressure for Scottish independence will be greater than ever: at 11pm Scotland was taken out of the EU against its will. Irish unification will have a new, pressing logic, one that will only increase as Britain erges from the EU, thickening that border down the Irish Sea. Meanwhile, Westminster, and especially Conservative, politics will have lost its perennial bogeyman, its reliable scapegoat for all ills: Brussels.Some remainers believe – and maybe even hope – that the shine will come off Brexit pretty soon. They point to new government advice warning citizens that, come next year, they could face roaming charges when they use their phones on the continent that they’ll need health insurance or a special driving licence or a visa to work or study that they’ll have to queue in the slower, non-EU lane at the airport. Remainers still have their charts, projecting a UK economy turned anaemic once Britain goes it alone. They are poised, ready to declare: “I told you so.”But all that is over the horizon. For now, Britain has made one of its periodic shifts away from the continent, in a relationship that has blown hot and cold for at least 1,200 years. Even the eighth century King Offa of Mercia fretted about trading links across the Channel. In that long sweep of history, the 47 years we spent as Britain-in-Europe might come to look like a blip. Alternatively, so might Brexit. Those draped in blue-and-gold flags could be right: Britain might one day be back, even if all but the most optimistic rejoiners believe that day is decades away.In Parliament Square, site of hoarse slanging matches for the past four years, the crowds on both sides were thinner on Friday night, at least before the Farage rally got going. The leavers were beaming, proud in their sweatshirts bearing the slogan: Job Done. They believe spring is coming. The remainers were wrapped up against the cold, braced against a January night, which, to them, felt like the bleakest midwinter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75843a9541dadd4c9a8cbe9b8f715f7956c6e4ba/769_769_2179_1308/master/2179.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d78f67f5003e61249ad788a20e77b071","title":"judge orders welsh tories lift suspension assembly member nick ramsay","story":"Judge finds in favour of Nick Ramsay after he was arrested and released without chargeThe leader of the Welsh Conservatives has been ordered by a high court judge to lift the suspension of an assembly member pending further legal action.Nick Ramsay, 44, was suspended from the Tory group after being arrested at his home in Raglan, Monmouthshire, on New Year’s Day. Gwent police released him the following afternoon, saying he would face no further action, but his suspension remained.Ramsay is suing Paul Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, at the high court.At a hearing in Bristol, Judge Jonathan Russen QC ordered the lifting of the suspension until a trial into the matter takes place in February. “In my judgment, it is appropriate that he is restored to the membership of the group,” Russen said.The court heard Ramsay was elected to the Welsh assembly in 2007 and became a member of the Conservative group.He was arrested on the evening of 1 January and spent the night in custody in Newport before being released without charge the following day. At 1.31pm on 2 January, Davies emailed Ramsay to tell him he had “no option” but to suspend him from the Welsh Conservatives.Representing Ramsay, David Lock QC said Davies “lacked the power” to do so and had not conformed to the rules of the group’s constitution. In a written statement, Ramsay said he was at his “wits’ end” and sought the assistance of the high court to end the stalemate.Richard Price QC, representing Davies, asked for an adjournment to prepare for the case as he had been given less than 24 hours’ notice.Price said eight members of the 11-strong assembly group had supported the suspension and it was not the case that Davies had “acted solo”.“The defendant and the other members of the group who are involved in the process are concerned there is a risk, if your lordship were to refuse my application for an adjournment, that this matter would be decided simply on the back of the evidence of the claimant alone,” he told the judge.The judge refused the application for an adjournment and allowed the interim injunction until the case is heard at a three-day trial in February. He said his ruling did not affect the disciplinary processes of the group.Speaking outside court, Ramsay said: “I am disappointed that I had to come to court today to achieve this result. However, I am grateful for the opportunity to continue serving my constituents and discharging my public functions.”The trial is to be listed at a court in either Bristol, Cardiff or London between 19 and 21 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37eb1003c5f0d92be81a2964342be5be7f9ee54e/0_587_5068_3039/master/5068.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6455f2583b63423e87b4bc3ac5b19299","title":"brexit britain wakes up to uncertain future after uk leaves eu live news and updates","story":"Follow the latest developments the day after Britain’s EU exitIt is now the afternoon after the night that was: Brexit day+1. The UK has now left the European Union, after 47 years inside the bloc.Here is a summary of the day’s events: PA Media has this report on the Labour leadership hustings in Bristol this morning:Labour leadership hopefuls Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy have urged the party to accept Brexit and move on, during the first hustings since the UK’s departure from the European Union.Long-Bailey and Nandy, who represent the leave-voting constituencies of Salford and Eccles, and Wigan respectively, said efforts should now be directed into ensuring a good trade deal is struck with Brussels.But the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, predicted the trade talks were unlikely to go smoothly and argued that Labour would need a remain-backing leader who had been “on the right side of the argument all along”.Long-Bailey told supporters at a hustings in Bristol that the party could not campaign at the next general election, expected in 2024, with the message of “we told you so” if the country’s economic fortunes dipped after leaving the EU.She admitted it was “sad” to see the UK’s orce from Brussels finalised this week but said the “debate is over”.“We cannot spend the next four years waiting to tell our constituents ‘We told you so’ and that we knew it was going to be this bad all along,” the shadow business secretary said.Instead, Labour had to make sure Boris Johnson negotiated the “best possible trade deal” that could help “rebuild our communities”.Nandy was critical of Labour’s reaction to the referendum outcome, accusing the leadership under Jeremy Corbyn of looking “backwards” after the result, rather than “looking forward to the country we can be”.“We completely missed the point of that political earthquake, which was a clamour for more power, more control and more agency across this country,” she said.The former shadow energy secretary, who voted for Johnson’s withdrawal agreement, admitted she had failed in her push for a Brexit deal that kept a close relationship with the EU.Thornberry took an opposing view to her two rivals and said she suspected the country would be “back in no-deal territory by the summer”.“What do we do at that stage? We need to have someone leading the fight who was on the right side of the argument all along,” said the Islington South and Finsbury MP, who is the only leadership contender not to have secured enough backing to advance to the final stage.The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, one of the architects of Labour’s second-referendum policy, said the ide between leave and remain voters must end, but accused the government of failing to address the “underlying reasons” why the electorate voted to leave the EU.The Agence France-Presse correspondent Marc Burleigh has shared footage of the moment the UK’s permanent representation to the EU had its name plate changed on Saturday. It is now called the British diplomatic mission. The union jack could be seen flying alone outside the building last night, after the European flag was taken down before Brexit.There was an increase in police clearances of Calais refugee camps in the days leading up to Brexit, PA Media reports.Clare Moseley, the founder of the aid organisation Care4Calais, said authorities were clearing people out of tents and fencing off larger areas in the French port town in recent weeks.Many people stay near the port and Eurotunnel stations in the hope of being able to cross to the UK, but Moseley described the last week as “horrible”.Before a visit to one of the sites on Saturday, she said: “As always the authorities’ response here is always to do with security and deterrent, so in the run-up to Brexit we’ve seen extra clearances, we’ve seen more brutal attempts to get people out of here.“Taking away their tents, moving people away from areas, fencing off even more of the areas where they stay.“It’s been a horrible week, it’s been very rough for a lot of the people here, spirits are very low and unfortunately that’s always the political response.”Care4Calais has provided for refugees in Calais and other towns across northern France and Belgium since 2016, the same year that the infamous “jungle camp” was evicted.As well as food and shelter, the charity tries to assist with mental wellbeing, to prevent suicide and self-harm.Moseley said she believed conditions could worsen, as the post-Brexit political climate will make authorities even keener to evict people from the areas.“Now Brexit has arrived I can only see things getting worse. Not so much because of Brexit, because the agreements here between France and the UK are just direct agreements, but in the political climate that we’re in now, all they want to do is get rid of the refugees.“It’s the same policy they’ve been following for the last 10 years.“It doesn’t work, but what they believe is that if they make conditions hard enough, people will stop coming, so that’s what they do, they make it as hard as they possibly can.”Moseley said the only way to solve the issues was to provide the means for people to cross to the UK safely.“The crux of the problem is that there is no safe and legal way for people to make an asylum claim in the UK.“To make an asylum claim in the UK, you have to physically be there, but there’s no way to do that, so people have to keep trying illegally.”Eddie Izzard has called for unity and to “make humanity great again” following the UK’s departure from the European Union.Shortly before 11pm on Friday, the comedian said in Twitter video that “we must now put isions behind us”. To this end, he also announced that he will attempt 28 marathons in 28 European countries over 28 days to raise money for charity.  “We Europeans have achieved so much since the end of the second world war, no matter how governmental agreements have changed,” he said. “We’ve achieved peace, above all peace, trade, friendship, a sharing of our cultures without losing our identities.” The EU will back Spain over its territorial claims to Gibraltar in the next phase of Brexit negotiations by giving Madrid the power to exclude the British overseas territory from any trade deal struck with Brussels.The Observer has learned that the Spanish government has insisted on reference to the Rock in the EU’s opening negotiating position, which will be published in draft form on Monday.Boris Johnson will be presented with the choice of reaching agreement with the Spaniards about Gibraltar’s future or exposing its citizens to economic peril by pushing it outside any EU-UK trade deal.Read the full story:Emmanuel Macron has said he would like to begin a new chapter between the UK and France based on “the strength of our unrivalled ties”. In a letter published in The Times on Saturday, the French president vowed to protect the rights of British citizens in France and French citizens in the UK. He said it was in our “common interest” to have as “close and deep a partnership as possible” in defence and security, and in police, judicial, environmental, scientific and cultural cooperation. But added that he must “be honest” that ease of access to the EU market will depend on the UK’s willingness to accept its rules. “We cannot allow any harmful competition to develop between us,” he wrote.Macron urged both the UK and the EU to “learn lessons” from Brexit.One reason for UK political leaders’ rejection of the EU was “to avoid having to deal with their own failures”, he said. Another was that Europe was “seen as not effective enough, not protective enough, distant from the realities of daily life”.The letter concludes: “Dear British friends, you are leaving the European Union but you are not leaving Europe.“Nor are you becoming detached from France or the friendship of its people. The channel has never managed to separate our destinies Brexit will not do so, either.“At 11pm last night we did not say ‘goodbye’, but an early ‘good morning’.”Boris Johnson intends to impose full customs checks on all goods coming into the UK from the EU, in a break with previous government policy, according to reports.“We are planning full checks on all EU imports – export declarations, security declarations, animal health checks and all supermarket goods to pass through border inspection posts,” the Daily  reported a senior Whitehall source as saying. “This will double the practical challenge at the border in January 2021.”The paper reports that businesses will be informed of the policy on 10 February.Read the full story:Males has rejoined the Commonwealth, bringing the total number of nations in the global organisation to 54, it has been announced.The change came into effect at one minute past midnight GMT on 1 February, just over an hour after the UK left the EU.The republic quit the Commonwealth in 2016 after being threatened with suspension over its human rights record and lack of progress on democratic reform.Read the full story:In other – non-Brexit-related – news, one of two people in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus has just been confirmed to be a University of York student.

While those levelling accusations of stupidity are themselves being accused of self-righteousness.Tom Peck, the Independent’s political sketch writer, describes the scenes at 11pm on Friday in Parliament Square as a “knuckle dragging carnival of irredeemable stupidity”.The LBC presenter James O’Brien has said that the lack of knowledge being displayed should come as no surprise. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation’s Helen Barnard, deputy director of policy and partnerships, has added:This has been a familiar refrain over the past three-and-a-half years – a sign of the huge task at hand in uniting a ided nation. ‘The most pointless, masochistic ambition in our country’s history’Ian McEwan paints a grim picture of what lies ahead now that Brexit is “done”, writing:We sense damage and diminishment ahead. In a dangerous world crowded with loud-mouthed ‘strongmen’, the EU was our best hope for an open, tolerant, free and peaceful community of nations. Those hopes are already threatened as populist movements have swept across Europe. Our withdrawal will weaken resistance to the xenophobic tendency.The lesson of our nation’s history these past centuries is plain: turmoil in continental Europe will draw us into bloody conflicts. Nationalism is rarely a project for peace. Nor does it care to counter climate change. It prefers to let tropical forests and the Australian bush burn.John le Carré reflects on how a lack of leadership today has allowed us to “sleepwalk” into Brexit.Here is a taste of his piece:We Brits are all nationalists now. Or so Johnson would have us believe. But to be a nationalist you need enemies and the shabbiest trick in the Brexiteers’ box was to make an enemy of Europe. “Take back control!” they cried, with the unspoken subtext: and hand it to Donald Trump, along with our foreign policy, our economic policy, our health service and, if they can get away with it, our BBC.The novelist this week won the Olof Palme prize for achievement in the spirit of the assassinated Swedish statesman.Brexit night passed in a largely peaceful manner, despite the at-times bitterly ided lengthy run-up to 31 January, PA Media reports.As people both celebrated and mourned the UK’s departure from the EU at major events across the country, there were just a handful of arrests.Police dealt with five people in Whitehall in London, including one man who was charged with criminal damage, and being drunk and disorderly.Kevin Murphy, 52, of north London, was due to appear at Westminster magistrates court on Saturday, the politan police said.A 28-year-old was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly, a 52-year-old was arrested for the same offence as well as obstructing a constable, and a 33-year-old was arrested under section 5 of the Public Order Act, and for failing to appear. All three men remain in custody.A 47-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of threatening behaviour but later released from custody and will not face any further action.In Glasgow, there was a heavy police presence in the city centre as groups for and against Brexit held events near each other.Pro-EU campaigners gathered at the Donald Dewar statue on Buchanan Street before the official departure time of 11pm.Police said one 25-year-old man was arrested for a minor disorder offence.Supt Mark Sutherland said: “A proportionate policing response was in place to ensure public safety and minimise disruption to the wider city centre community. The events passed peacefully with only one arrest.”The Police Service of Northern Ireland said there had been no arrests at a celebration in Belfast.The Green MEP Catherine Rowett marks her return from Brussels this morning with a “European breakfast”.

The 21-year-old daughter of Russian emigres, who arrived in the United States with little but hope and two children, is not only the youngest American to win a major since Serena Williams 18 years ago, but the youngest Melbourne champion since Maria Sharapova in 2008.There were brief moments early in her 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 win at Rod Laver Arena – witnessed by, among many celebrities, the man himself and Margaret Court, the finest Australian player in the history of the game – when Kenin looked as if she might find the occasion too much for her.Those who know her well talk of a quiet, shy player but on court she has the stamp of a champion, sure of her ability and able to fight her way out of tight corners, which she has had to do several times in the final stages of the tournament, as the matches became tougher.“This is my first speech, but I’m going to try my best,” she said before going into a blizzard of thank yous that took in everyone from her opponent, the crowd, her team and her parents. “My dream officially came true. I am so emotional. I have worked so hard. These have been the best two weeks of my life.”She added: “I’m so proud of myself, my dad, my team, everyone that has been around me. We’ve worked all hard. We’ve been through tough times. We did it. We fought. I’m on cloud nine.”Muguruza, naturally enough, was downbeat and conceded, “At important moments, I didn’t find my shots and she found hers. I lacked a little bit of energy after so many matches. Physically, it was a tough battle.”Kenin, who moves up to No 7 in the world and No 1 in her own country, is on the map now, joining a string of prodigies that have begun to make their presence felt at the highest level in recent months and years as Williams wanes and more experienced players fight to fill the vacuum.“She is not a flash in the pan,” Chris Evert said of Kenin on ESPN. “She is going to be around a long, long time. She can improve, her serve, her volley. But, more importantly, she has the taste of winning a grand slam. There are going to be some great rivalries in the future. We can’t rely on Serena to hold that torch for much longer.”Muguruza, unseeded and recovering from a virus, beat two top 10 players on the way to the final to confirm the pedigree that had already won her the French Open and Wimbledon, but Kenin showed her respect only in the sense of treating each ball as if it needed to be destroyed. “You’re going to win more finals, for sure,” the Spaniard told her conqueror.When Muguruza broke early, it seemed Kenin might fold under the pressure such an experienced and fierce competitor can bring to the big occasion. But the American displayed the same tenacity as in her win over Barty, the world No 1, in the semi-finals, hunting down one lost cause after another.Her weapons are not big but they are reliable. Nevertheless, despite taking the Spaniard to deuce in the sixth game, Kenin could not stop her getting to 4-2 with a solid back-hand volley.Muguruza served for the set after 47 minutes. With two set points in her pocket she wobbled, refusing a volley and making a mess of her tentative forehand from the middle of the court. She was relieved when Kenin went unnecessarily hard at a big winner and found the tramlines.If Kenin is the game’s Rock of Gibraltar, Muguruza is its Kilimanjaro: daunting but beatable. It took Muguruza five days to conquer the fabled mountain in November, but her final was turned upside down in 20 minutes as Kenin took advantage of her noticeably poor movement and weakened serve to breeze to a 4-1 lead. Serving to stay in the set, Muguruza handed Kenin another set point and she took it to level at one apiece. The fightback was officially up and running.Muguruza, who had to fight hard to get to the final, looked to be paying the price for that struggle. The physio came on during the interval to check some stiffness in her left hip, but did not treat her. If her problem was more psychosomatic than physical, she was in trouble, continuing to wreck good work in long rallies with careless ground strokes.She went missing for extended stretches in her semi-final against Simona Halep, yet managed to regroup each time. So it proved in the third set as both players raised their level, very few points given up cheaply.Following a big serve wide to the net at deuce, Muguruza dollied an easy shot long and double-faulted to go 2-4 down.With ball in hand, and her head dipping towards the ground in that idiosyncratic way of hers just before her ball-toss, Kenin had the title on her racket. Hitting fiercely and screaming like a banshee, she willed herself to within a game of victory.Muguruza stepped up to try to repair the damage at 2-5, as the match neared two hours. She found an eighth ace for 30-0, down the ‘T’, but Kenin replied to her second serve with a wicked, unreachable backhand. She responded with another ace – then double-faulted twice for deuce. Another serve floated wide and Kenin cashed in when the second effort dropped mid-court.Kenin hit long on championship point, kissed the line to get another shot at glory. Muguruza saved her the chore of winning it outright with her third double-fault of the game, her eighth of the match. It was a curious end to an absorbing final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8460c768817c7a8522b24de1e123d62f4a9f672e/275_489_3509_2105/master/3509.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=629395429d75509f75cce0009c46dd5c","title":"honeysuckle irish champion rachael blackmore","story":"Honeysuckle was cut from 6-1 to 9-2 by Paddy Power to win the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham next month after taking the Irish equivalent here on Saturday under a strong ride by Rachael Blackmore, who was completing a Grade One double on the day.It was a performance that left some questions unanswered, however, as Henry de Bromhead’s mare jumped slowly at several obstacles and was under strong pressure to hold off the persistent Petit Mouchoir in the closing stages.

Instead, he and his partner were forced to smile through the frustration as a match that had started so promisingly slipped away in a flash, ending at the stroke of midnight.“The first time Beth’s been lost for words,” said Murray after the American delegated the runners-up speech to him. “We’ve fought hard enough. It’s always fun whenever we take the court we’ve had a lot of success but most of all a lot of fun and I hope it continues for many more years.”Between his court awareness, reflexes and magical touches around the net, Murray’s doubles prowess has afforded him a superstar cast of partners throughout his career. He won his first slam at Wimbledon in 2007 alongside Jelena Jankovic, reached the 2018 Wimbledon final with Victoria Azarenka and his wildly successful partnership with 25-times slam champion Martina Hingis brought him titles at Wimbledon and the US Open in 2017.Few have matched the productivity of his partnership with Mattek-Sands, 34, a solid singles player who found her calling in doubles later on and has racked up nine doubles slam titles since 2015. Mattek-Sands marches around the court in trademark black knee length socks and infinite shades of pink, and her ceaselessly aggressive ball striking and net rushing presents the same flair as her attire, but consistency is often a problem. On Saturday both players were too erratic against a solid Croatian-Czech duo that gave away nothing.The victory marks a first slam title for Croatia’s Mektic, ranked 22nd in doubles, and a fourth overall slam for former WTA doubles No 1 Krejcikova, of the Czech Republic, who successfully defended the 2019 title she won with Rajeev Ram of the United States.On Sunday, Ram will partner Joe Salisbury in the men’s doubles final and Salisbury will be gunning to become the first British slam champion since Murray when they face the Australian wildcards Max Purcell and Luke Saville. Salisbury, 27, was ranked outside of the top 100 until 2018 but the 11th seeds will have an enormous opportunity as they take on the surprise finalists.On Saturday, Britain’s Andy Lapthorne was beaten 6-0, 6-4 by Dylan Alcott of Australia in the quad wheelchair singles final. Alcott, who secured his sixth straight Australian Open title and 10th overall, has become a home favourite. He cried as he revealed that with his team they had pledged $800 for each of his 41 aces during the tournament for people with a disability hurt by the bushfires, taking his total donation to $40,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/611089bb87dc406e0e12d1b060da4401b1f8a4e5/0_48_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79981b081a0f7b1b00b31af1f03fd74b","title":"wales italy six nations match report","story":"The question of whether Wales will wane under Wayne Pivac was not posed here with Italy willing but feeble as they started life without Sergio Parisse. Ireland in Dublin on Saturday are far more likely to demand an answer, but the home side achieved a first under their new head coach, not conceding a point for the first time in the Six Nations as well as banking a bonus.The difference another way makes was evident from the kick-off and was highlighted when Nick Tompkins came off the bench to make his Test debut. Wales had possession for two minutes and did not resort to the boot once. Leigh’s Halfpenny passed when fielding a kick in his own half and the recipient, Dan Biggar, who last year would have sent the ball high into the air and set off in determined pursuit, set off and passed.It was the unfurling of a flag with more colours. Wales were not reluctant to take to the skies but there was an attacking intent to the strategy with few incontestable kicks. Italy’s full-back, Matteo Minozzi, is not the most physically imposing in the game but, if he had feared being buried underneath a posse of chasers, it was his positioning rather than his courage that was tested.Wales played a certain way under Warren Gatland but here they varied their game against opponents who were anxious to speed up the game without being able to control the breakdown. If it marked an ideal start for Pivac, it was poor preparation for Dublin and there were areas of concern, not least the set-pieces and defence around the fringes where Italy enjoyed some profit.It was Wales’s eight successive victory in the Six Nations, which equalled their record, and it also extended their run at home to six wins. Before Gatland they lost in front of their supporters in the tournament more often than they won, 10-9, but in his 12 years they suffered six defeats and only England have won here since 2013.Italy never looked like emulating their 2006 draw at the ground, never mind improving on it. They conceded two penalties at the breakdown in the opening 10 minutes which Biggar converted into points before adding a third after Andrea Lovotti tripped Halfpenny as the full-back chased his kick into space. The Azzurri had their moments, Abraham Steyn’s disguised pass putting Matti Bellini into space, but they were reduced to sniping and crumpled all too readily in defence.Wales’s two first-half tries were scored by Josh Adams and took him to 12 in the last year, the highest in Test rugby. Both came from line-outs that had followed penalties. Wales clustered the midfield and drew the defence before long passes from Tompkins and Halfpenny gave Adams just enough room to score in the corner.Tompkins, on as a temporary replacement for Johnny McNicholl, who was having a head injury assessment, had won the penalty after forcing Bellini to hold on after a tackle. He made a permanent entry after 52 minutes, taking over from Hadleigh Parkes, and provided the creativity Wales need if they are to turn the thoughts of Pivac into results.He scored Wales’s third try on 59 minutes after the game had started to drift. Cory Hill broke from his open half and, after declining to pass to Biggar outside him, went to ground. Italy were still working out where to position themselves when Tompkins picked up, ran straight through a hole where a guard should have been, turned Matteo Minozzi inside out and scored under the posts from 35 metres.Four minutes later he set up George North, drawing Jayden Hayward before timing his pass, but the bonus-point try was ruled out after a review showed Tompkins had flicked the ball forward in the build-up. The only try Wales scored when he was not on the field came after 28 minutes when they got nowhere with a maul before Biggar passed to Adams beneath his legs and exposed Leonardo Sarto who had drifted away from the player he should have been marking.Tompkins was Wales’s central figure in the final quarter, adept at raising the pace of the game and detecting fractures in the defensive line. They secured the bonus point with three minutes to go through North who, despite taking a pass from Rhys Webb behind him, had the strength to turn and power through two tackles, assisted by Alun Wyn Jones, before setting up Adams’s hat-trick. Italy, for the fourth time in the Six Nations, were pointless, left clutching their victory in the Under-20 international in Colwyn Bay the night before."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d511686bb105320b32109e87aa1a3b887d7f693e/77_142_4208_2525/master/4208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae41a7d5176fbc2c32737e1f3e95628d","title":"six nations 2020 ireland v scotland live","story":"A fantastic is sometimes frustrating half of rugby. Scotland will be furious and their lack of composure in key positions. Ireland will be delighted to be up by four.39 mins. It’s all gone mad! Ireland make a clean break through Ringrose and it looks a worry for Scotland until Johnson gambles big on an intercept and wins it. He runs full pelt back into the Ireland half and after a few offloads there finally a tackle and YET AGAIN Ireland nick it at the breakdown. Hastings is visibly fuming in backfield. You’re not the only one, lad.It was a long way out and the extra effort caused it to be pulled left.36 mins. Hogg throws a huge pass infield to Hastings, which looked good for the cameras but put his 10 is all kinds of trouble from the Ireland defence. As the other players desperately try to help one of them is off feet at the ruck. Kickable if difficult penalty for Ireland, this.34 mins. Sexton makes no mistake from just left of the post and 25 metres out.33 mins. Stockdale opens his legs for the first time and makes forty metres up the left into the Scotland half. They work the ball to the centre of the pitch before Ali Price gives away a penalty for tackling Murray from an offside position at the ruck.That started right, went more right and finished completely right of the posts.31 mins. Another promising attacking position for Scotland from a scrum and yet another error turns over possession to Ireland. Townsend will be fuming with this. After Ireland boot the ball away it’s another Scotland penalty that Hastings fancies.30 mins. Stuart Hogg, clearly wishing to make Murray feel better, misses touch with a horrible penalty punt and back come Ireland from inside their own half. There’s some grumbling from the crowd after Larmour looks to be taken late after he chips and chases in his own 22. There was nothing much in it, and the Irish fans should direct their dissatisfaction with what a brainless play that was from their fullback28 mins.  Ireland are back in the Scotland 22 up the right through Ringrose and Conway, as it breaks down it looks dangerous for Scotland, but the TMO has spotted Peter O’Mahony taking a player out in backplay. Penalty Scotland.26 mins.  Ireland have a rolling maul on the go and Murray pumps one of the worst box kicks I’ve ever seen into the air. It went about 10 feet forward and was so bad it bamboozled Scotland into being offside. 25 mins. Scotland another lineout in the Ireland 22, this time on the left. They win this one cleanly off the top and Sam Johnson smashes up on a lovely crash ball angle up to five metres of the line. But Ireland nick it back! So frustrating for Scotland - so many good positions and possessions given away, four turnover so far.22 mins. The scrum goes down a few times and ref Raynal wants a word with the front rows. Scotland make a mess of Ireland’s scrum at the next one, but CJ Stander just grabs the ball out in time to avoid a penalty before Murray sends it away via his boot, but only as far as his own ten metre line. Scotland decide the best way to take advantage of this is by losing their own lineout. 20 mins. Scotland win the lineout but as they try to set up the maul Peter O’Mahony gets amongst it and forces them to knock on, he then squares up to Fagerson. Safe to say he’s making a point since he came on about how he feels about not starting18 mins. Another penalty to Scotland, this time for Ireland off feet at breakdown. However, it was this close to being a penalty the other way after van der Flier clamped on. Fine margins and all that. Hogg launches the kick for a scotland lineout 10 metres from Ireland’s line16 mins. He hit that with all the confidence of trying to push a slice of boiled ham into a coin slot, but it somehow swerved its way over fro 40 metres on the angle. Amazing stuff15 mins. Scotland win a penalty at the scrum for Cian Healy hinging and collapsing the scrum as Fagerson went to work on him. It’s left and a long way out but Hastings is taking it on.13 mins. Plenty of rugby in the opening minutes, and plenty to like about it as well. Ireland keep the faith with this and try to go from their own 22 from the kick-off but lose it forward thanks to so good work from Jame Ritchie in contact. Scotland scrum inside Ireland half on left of field coming up.11 mins. Herring finds Ryan at the tail and the green pack rumbles towards the line. They are camped on the Scotland five metre and have drifted offside, but as the advantage is played the Sexton Runaround is employed and the new captain is in to score.He dusts himself down and adds the extras himself.8 mins.  Ireland finally have their first period of proper possesion and they are up into the Scotland half via a rapid line break from Larmour joining the line. Scotland scramble back to cover the subsequent phase and the men in green are now trying to repeatedly to punch up through the forwards and failing to get far. It’s lost to the tenacious Scotland defence, but Haining is then pinged for holding on at the next breakdown. Gah! Sexton puts the ball in the corner in the 22 and Ireland will go for the line from here.5 mins. Once all that is sorted, Hastings calmly strokes the ball over.5 mins. Scotland have had quite the all-court game in their first two attacks: strong carries, beating the first man, plenty of fast hands. Promising stuff all round.There’s a break in play as debutant Doris is down and it looks serious - he was out cold but he’s on his feet now. Peter O’Mahony is stripped and ready to go - some replacement that.4 mins. Rob Herring makes no error with the first lineout throw of the post-Best era and Sexton kicks the ball back to Scotland who make some more metres up Conway’s wing again. Hogg pops up on the line and goes on a slaloming stop-start run that beats three and take his team back into the Ireland 22. At the next breakdown Scotland have kickable penalty.2 mins.  Scotland have the ball returned to them and on the third phase they make some headway out left before a strong carry by Scott Cummings sees them within ten metres before Caelan Doris clamps onto the ball to give Ireland a penalty for Scotland holding on. Bright start from Scotland, that.Stuart Hogg chips the ball high into the Dublin gloaming and deep into the Ireland 22 and we’re underway.The teams are on the pitch pressing flesh with the Irish President, who seems to get shorter each year.It’ll be anthems then action soon.Adam Hastings has a load of calls and numbers written on his left hand. One of them is called “Bottle Mickey”, which I love. What other names for calls would you like to see?“The Puncher of Baghdad”“Skirting Board Paul”“Gwyn Ferret”“Terry Eggs”“The Magic Show”Short time to get the final messages across in the dressing room. Gregor Townsend will be telling Adam Hastings that he is absolutely good enough and to go out there and do his thing. At least that what he should be saying.Like his team’s new head coach, John is confident and clear in his expections. Hard to disagree with that, John, but a worry for Ireland is that no-one is talking about Scotland at all. But that’s probably because they come to Ireland and win about as often as the Eurovision Song Contest.All the chat in the pre-match interviews is about Finn Russell’s absence, and Gregor Townsend looks none too impressed when asked the third question about it in two minutes on the TV. And you can understand why, Russell has been on fire for Racing since his move to France, but I’m not so sure he has enough in the bank with his Scotland performances for every moment of the preparation to be about him not being there. He’s a loss, of course, but some measure of perspective is probably in order here.The Scotland coach wants his team to get stuck in and amongst it.How will Ireland’s attack look?Anyone who has followed rugby for the past five years or so knows exactly what an Andy Farrell defence looks like: part organisation, part obscene levels of effort and totally terrifying mostly. But what no-one is certain about is what to expect from a Farrell attack, for the main reason that he’s never officially had a role with that part in the job description. We are left, as so often in these situations, to look at Farrell the player for clues. If we are to look at his time on the pitch in Union we would conclude that his attack will look like forwards playing in the backs, lashed together with gaffer tape after multiple injuries and with all the pace of a traction engine travelling in a low emissions zone. But, in Rugby League he was an attacking fulcrum at loose forward and sometimes stand-off of one the best teams in the world ever to play either code. My money is on the latter playing more of a part, and his bringing in of Mike Catt to the coaching panel also suggests that we’ll see more craft than Schmidt’s latter period box kicking apocalypse.Tell me what you reckonLet my inbox and feed be blessed with all your wisdom, even if it has little actual wisdom. You can email me or tweet @bloodandmudResearch shows that most people in the world are comfortable with change as long it is mostly the same but a little bit of difference. For example, moving desks at work is OK as long as you get to keep your pictures and not end up next to that tosser who bangs on about Crossfit all the time.Farrell has started his period of change with, on the face of it, a similar approach. Small numbers of changes have been made, some forced (Herring for the retired Best, Conway for the crocked Earls) and some unforced, and that’s where it gets more interesting. The titanic Munsterman, Peter O’Mahony, is on the bench to accommodate a move to blind-side for his clubmate CJ Stander while arguably the breakthrough player of the year, Caelan Doris ,starts at Eight. O’Mahony has not been in the best form this year, but it’s still a big call and suggest Farrell wants a little bit more obvious brute force physicality from his back row. Conor Murray has fought off the creeping threat of the red hot John Cooney to start and Devin Toner is back on the bench after his World Cup exile. Adam Hastings is in at fly-half for Scotland in place of the absent Finn Russell, who left the squad after a disagreement over booze and was last seen in Dubai with some booze, so that’s all going very well for all concerned, eh? Oh..Nick Haining makes his debut in an all-Edinburgh back row and Huw Jones returns after he appears to have turned around his profound dip in form from last year.Welcome to our coverage of the first visit of the Six Nations to Dublin in this 2020 outing.There’s been quite a bit of transition talk in the past 24 hours, and this will continue here as Ireland face the first challenge of the post-Schmidt era. Andy Farrell doesn’t have to bother himself with future trading relationships and borders and the like, but he will be mindful of some voices off murmuring that, for all his coaching achievements, none of them were with him as a head coach. Can he hack being the head honcho? The fact that he captained Wigan while most lads his age were still obsessing over whether they would get served without ID and then his country while still one of the youngest in the squad suggests that the burden of responsibility was never really a burden at all. The men he is charged with rallying have been in quite the funk for the best part of a year playing a limited gameplan with diminishing returns and a whiff of not all being happy at the dog end of the Joe Schmidt’s previously successful reign. It’s a lot to take on with your first head role, and Farrell’s team will be expected to win here against a Scotland team shorn of their mercurial superstar, Finn Russell.Lose here, or labour to an unconvincing win, and some of those murmurings about lack of experience could become more full throated, but it should still be a while before any fat ladies start warming up their vocal chords."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/594070059eedd1bd7302745eb7be84c9d08b99ee/0_80_2941_1765/master/2941.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a75150e0d7d0bb784cdd7b8fb493bad1","title":"six nations 2020 wales v italy live","story":"Wales winger Josh Adams scored a hat-trick as the defending Grand Slam champions overwhelmed Italy in the tournament curtain-raiser in CardiffSo that’s that. The result was literally never in doubt, and a 42-0 scoreline will raise a few eyebrows in rival camps. Even if Italy weren’t the toughest of opponents today, Wales were ruthless and clinical, and demonstrated their cold-eyed determination to win the Six Nations again following last season’s Grand Slam triumph. England, Ireland, Scotland and France will all be painfully aware that a similar fate awaits them if they don’t perform when they come up against Alun Wyn Jones’s men.Wayne Pivac’s stated aim of building his team’s attack while maintaining a very solid defence has got off to the best possible start. Warren-ball becomes Wayne-ball - and Wales’s Six Nations rivals have been warned. Thank you for reading today’s minute-by-minute and see you all next time. Bye.Hot off the press - Paul Rees’s report from the Principality Stadium in Cardiff:Wales coach Wayne Pivac speaks: “I’m pretty happy, getting the five points and the bonus point is important going forward. We defended well too, and we’re happy to keep them to zero. It was far from the perfect performance, there is definitely more we can do at the breakdown, with and without the ball ... There were some good performances out there, McNicholl and Tompkins both did well and Tompkins has a bright future.”We will have the match report coming up soon ... meanwhile the hits keep on coming as another Six Nations kicks off today. Lee Calvert AKA Blood and Mud is on minute-by-minute duty for Ireland v Scotland which is kicking off in about 20 minutes:Azzurri skipper Luca Bigi speaks after what looked to be a pretty demoralising day. But he’s not feeling too downhearted: “It was tough, we knew it was going to be. We played well, we created a lot but we didn’t finalise it ... we showed what we worked on in training. Our set-piece wasn’t going very well. We have to focus on our set-piece to create ball for our backs.”The BBC pundits are picking over the finer tactical points. One of the star performers today, in my humble opinion, was Michael Cheika, who was a very entertaining and intelligent contributor in commentary.Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones speaks: “We knew it was the start of the competition ... we’re very conscious of a strong and exciting Italian side that were coming here ... credit to them, we were flat at the start of the second half but we did what we needed to do. It’s a foundation for a new regime, there’s still four games in the competition, we’ll go one at a time. It’s a start, that’s all. Hopefully the squad will only get stronger when the injured guys come back.”That was the 135th cap for Jones and he still looks physically dominant, not to mention incredibly composed and intelligent in the way he leads the team. What a player.Michele Campagnaro, ex-Italy player, on the Azzurri’s efforts: “They’ve been fearless, they tried a lot, but unfortunately they didn’t finish any of their opportunities. But there are a lot of positives to take moving forward.”Justin Tipuric has a chat with the BBC: “It’s a great team performance, it’s nice to start the campaign with a bonus-point win and it makes special to have a zero on the board, too. It’s a great start. I think we can keep getting better and better ... it’s just a snapshot of what we can do today. Hopefully we can improve as the tournament goes on. The strength in depth in the back row in Wales is crazy really ... whoever takes the field has to put a shift in.”Game over. Buonanotte, Italia. Wales were very impressive there. Josh Adams notched a hat-trick, Dan Biggar was flawless, James Tompkins was superb ... and Justin Tipuric was everywhere. I’m a bit undecided how bad Italy were ... they did OK with the ball in hand at times but there did seem to be some yawning gaps when it came to defending.80 min: Lazzaroni makes a dart out of defence for Italy, but Wales win it back, and Big George North charges towards the line as the Italian defenders scramble to cover. Wales recycle it, Adams grabs it, and finishes brilliantly from close range. Halfpenny drills the penalty straight through the posts and it’s all over. 79 min: Tipuric, who has made a massive 21 tackles, gets an approving roar from the home fans as his Player of the Match award is announced on the PA. We are nearly into the red zone, time-wise, and Italy have a scrum on halfway. If he’s watching, Shaun Edwards - now with France - will cast an approving eye over that scoreline, with a big fat zero against Italy’s name ...This time, North has his try, no doubt. Wales build irresistible pressure almost under the posts. A pass pops up to North and he’s almost dragged over the line by his team-mate Alun Wyn Jones. Halfpenny smacks over the conversion. Italy are going home with ‘nil points’, it would seem. Pivac can have a beer later and reflect on a job well done in his first competitive outing with the team. Good signs for Wales. Justin Tipuric is named Player of the Match by Jonathan Davies on commentary.75 min: Five minutes to go. Attacking line-out for Wales ... right in the corner. A failure to get this bonus-point could cost them in the long run ...73 min: The fresh legs of Jarrod Evans help to make inroads for Wales into the left-hand corner with a bright run. Italy turn it over, but then Canna slices a clearing kick almost straight into touch. Wales will have a good platform here to go for that fourth try ...70 min: Dan Biggar has gone off, for Jarrod Evans. A good day at the office for Biggar. For Italy, Federico Zani has come on for Luca Bigi.69 min: A ball-carrying Ross Moriarty crunches into a tackle in midfield, and Wales are on the front foot again. But they really need this fourth try for the bonus point.68 min: This is game over and was a long time ago, obviously. Wales fans, how does this performance make you feel about the team’s chances for the tournament? Fancy a win at Twickenham in a few weeks’ time?66 min: Minozzi with a kick ahead now and into the danger zone for Wales, down the Italian left wing. But the kick flies into touch. He had a man inside him - and that’s a waste. Can they find a score, any score, in the next 15 minutes or so?65 min: Tompkins is looking really good here, and is attracting some warm praise from Wales fans over on social media.Big George North! Tompkins does beautifully to put his centre colleague in for the fourth try of the match. It’s a break down the right wing, the Italian defence is out-numbered, and it’s a simple finish ... but there is a TMO check, and it’s brought back for a knock-on earlier in the move. No bonus point just yet for Pivac and his men.The third try! Class finish by the Saracens centre and debutant, too. Substitute Hill makes a break in midfield. He is tackled, but Wales recycle it, and Tompkins spots a gap straight down the middle. He steps beyond the full-back and finishes it with style, and runs in under the posts. Biggar belts over an easy conversion. It’s 28-0.58 min: Again, Italy make a couple of decent runs in midfield, but again, they get nowhere. They are more often than not driven back in contact and fail to get over the gain line. Before the match, Pivac spoke of wanting to keep the Warren-ball defensive system while adding to the attack. That’s pretty much what they’ve done so far.56 min: Rob Evans and Corey Hill come on for Wales. Licata and Hayward are on for Italy. On the pitch, Wales have a defensive scrum in their own 22.54 min: “The Welsh were a bit more numberous in defence.” Michael Cheika has invented a new word! That is easily the best thing that’s happened since half-time. Numberous.This victory will equal Wales’s Championship record of eight consecutive victories in the Six Nations, by the way. Their joint-winningest run in the competition.52 min: Italy go through a couple of phases after the scrum, in the Welsh 22. Some might say they’re going through the motions, although that would be harsh. They are doing what they can, but Wales are just too strong. Now Italy are pinged for coming in at the side, Wales have a penalty, and the pressure is relieved. Meanwhile, Faletau goes off for Wales and Ross Moriarty comes on. The crowd is fairly quiet.50 min: More good phase play and more strong carries from Italy. They progress into the Welsh 22, and win a penalty. They choose to have a scrum. Over in the Males, Sergio Parisse is probably on his third bottle of Peroni, shouting at the telly, willing his team-mates to at least get on the board here.48 min: Not a massive amount happening right now, in truth. But there is some replacements news: Fischetti and Riccioni are on for Italy in the front row. Again, Cheika bemoans the lack of quick ball from Italy, which is allowing the Welsh defence to reset at their leisure.47 min: Here is that cheeky no-look Biggar pass. Looks OK to me! Good skills.43 min: Wales full-back Halfpenny runs directly at the Italian defence, yet again, straight up the middle. Wales recycle the ball and work it left, and Tomos Williams makes another strong dart towards the Italy 22. But in the next phase, Jake Ball is penalised for an illegal clear-out.41 min: Italy begin the second half with a couple of good, strong carries over the halfway line, including one from Polledri. Then Bellini makes a burst down the left.Cheika again: “They’re carrying the ball strongly, the Italians, but there’s no quick ball.”He’s good at this, is Cheika. He’s offering a lot of decent insights.Italy kick off the second half. Can they make any inroads into that Welsh lead?Geoff Wignall emails: “Wales are full value for their lead, clearly but am I alone in thinking Biggar’s through the legs pass went forward?”I didn’t notice that, I must admit ... anyone else?? Thanks for the email, Geoff. The second half is just moments away. The players, in fact, are jogging out on to the pitch right now ...Cheika sums up how Pivac and Wales will be treating this match: “This game will give them a chance to get their defensive system right with a new coach. When the bigger attacking threats come later in the tournament, they’ll be up for it.”An email arrives from John Rogers:Here we are with another Six Nations and so far it’s all systems normal (i.e. Italy are struggling). Always at this time of year my thoughts turn to Dan Lucas. We miss you Dan and won’t ever forget you. I’m sure you’re running the great live commentary in the sky.”Ahead of “Le Crunch” tomorrow, here is Andy Bull on Fabien Galthié’s blueprint to beat Eddie Jones and England:Pivac will be pleased with that, and no mistake. Wales have punished their opponents ruthlessly and scored a couple of well-worked tries. Italy haven’t been terrible but they are inferior in every department so far. Still, there are some positives for them to build on and it would be nice for the Azzurri to get on the board, at least ...40 min + 2: Italy win a penalty for Wales collapsing the rolling maul ... Italy kick for touch again, and try the rolling maul again, but Wales hold firm and it comes to nothing.40 min: Italy finish the half on the front foot, with three runners chasing down Leigh Halfpenny in the Welsh left-hand corner. Halfpenny does well, but Wales then cough up a penalty for hands on the floor - and Italy kick for touch. Can they establish a foothold right at the end of the half?39 min: Faletau fights his way through a couple of tackles near the Italian line. But Allan wins a penalty after intercepting a Tomos Williams pass - and then effects an excellent clearing kick.37 min: Nearly try No 3 for Wales! A charge-down bounces up invitingly for scrum-half Tomos Williams in the Italian 22 but he can’t quite gather it - and Italy winger Leonardo Sarto does well to grab the ball and clear the danger.Now there’s a huge cheer for a bloke called Sam Warburton, who has run on with some water bottles. He is the breakdown coach, of course, and a bit of a legend in these parts.“Pivac-ball looking good so far. I didn’t have high hopes for this campaign, and yes, I know it’s ‘only’ Italy, but I’m encouraged by how fluent and together Wales have looked.”Yes, this is pretty much a 1010 display from Wales so far, and like Cheika said, it’s hardly as if Italy are a shambles. Wales have looked for space and punished the opposition clinically when they’ve found it. It’s reminiscent of that Georgia game in the Rugby World Cup when everything Wales tried in attack seemed to come off. Although they lost the plot in the second half that day ...Cheika on commentary: “It’s not like Italy have played poorly ... especially in attack, they’ve put some nice moves together. But they’ve left a few spaces at the back and they’ve been punished.”Too true. Italy have been decent, but they are being overwhelmed by a better team.This is all class from Dan Biggar. Wales build pressure in the left-hand corner and move to with a couple of metres of the try-line. Tomos Williams spins a pass off his right hand to where Biggar is waiting. Biggar knows exactly where Adams is lurking, out on thw wing, so he crouches down, and sends a brilliant no-look off-load between his own legs - and Adams flops over. Biggar converts. Lovely rugby, skilful and clinical, and Italy are already beaten with 10 minutes left in the first half.27 min: Super kick by scrum-half Williams into the corner with the full-back Minozzi missing, trapped at the bottom of a ruck. The ball bounces slowly, and perfectly finds touch, right in the corner. The crowd - who seem a touch quiet in general - roar their approval. Italy sensibly take it quickly though and successfully manage to clear the danger. Italy have shown some intelligence and skill in the way they’ve played their rugby so far - but Wales are still comfortably outclassing them.25 min: A tidy line-out by Wales near halfway, and they spin the ball right, right across the field to the far side of the pitch as the camera looks at it. North then tries an elaborate off-load to his right-winger but it’s spoiled by an Italian hand.23 min: More than halfway through the first half and Wales are cruising ... but a good scrum from Italy brings a penalty, which they waste by booting it straight back and into Welsh hands. Minozzi then makes another break in midfield after Wales, too, kick the ball back and keep it in play."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a18ecad66332a78cc8aa9edba4d2db5f71d0080/0_96_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d24faa9f5aba345cfe4042e209f54546","title":"boxed in amazon refused to take back unwanted delivery","story":"Tony Harding, 79, was left with a heavy exercise bike he did not order and told he would have to dispose of it himselfA pensioner from Bristol has described his disbelief after Amazon delivered a 28kg (62lb) exercise machine he had not ordered, and then flatly refused to take it away – leaving it blocking his front room.Tony Harding, who is 79 and unable to move the heavy item, says Amazon effectively abandoned the giant box in his and his wife’s Winterbourne home, apparently expecting him to dispose of the brand new exercise bike himself. Despite asking both the driver who brought the item, and a second driver who delivered the order he had been expecting, neither would take away the £149 machine. Customer services told him it was highly unlikely the company would come to retrieve the fitness bike, and he would have to dispose of it.Harding, who says he rarely uses Amazon because of concerns over its tax affairs, says he “held his nose” in January and ordered a 20kg bag of reconstituted logs.But he got more than he bargained for when the driver arrived with an enormous box, wrongly bearing his name and address.“When I pointed out that the package contained a Nero Sports fitness bicycle, the delivery driver suggested that my logs might have been packed inside the box. I was flabbergasted by this suggestion, by which time the delivery man was halfway down the path. When I came to my senses I suggested to him that he should take the package back, or at least check that someone else in the Bristol area was due to receive a fitness bike. After checking his notes I was told he could not take the item back since he only did deliveries,” Harding says.After finding his way through the maze of the Amazon website he says he eventually found a number to call where a very helpful person agreed to replace his missing logs. But when these arrived the second driver also refused to take the bike away.“I was also told that if no one came to collect the fitness bike within 48 hours, I should feel free to dispose of it as I thought fit. That would be OK if had any use for an exercise bike, but I don’t. Aside from the inconvenience of having it filling my front room, I’m astonished at the cavalier waste of the world’s resources that have gone into this whole process. I’m guessing that someone else has ordered this machine and they have been similarly sent a replacement, when they should have this one,” he says.After  Money stepped in, the response was swift – and the firm collected the package from Harding almost immediately, with a bouquet of flowers and a box of chocolates.A spokesman for Amazon said: “We have contacted the customer to apologise for his experience and collect the bike. We have also investigated the matter with our delivery partner and are taking appropriate action.”Environmental groups are increasingly questioning the role of tech firms and their lack of response to the climate emergency.Last August, Amazon was criticised by activists and customers after introducing a range of plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK. The online retailer had started sending small items in unrecyclable plastic envelopes, seemingly to allow more parcels to be loaded on to each delivery truck.In 2018, Money highlighted the extraordinary case of south London resident Tiffany Crow, who was being bombarded with hundreds of parcels from Amazon. Boxes of wireless speakers, fitness wristbands and batches of projectors kept arriving at her home, forcing her to spend hours dealing with them, and recycling all the packaging. Her repeated calls to Amazon to get them stopped drew a blank, and like Harding she was told she could do what she liked with them.In January, hundreds of Amazon employees in the US defied corporate policy to publicly criticise the company for failing to meet its “moral responsibility” in the face of the climate crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68d361bc9baf97aeee1261f7b98cb854201494b6/0_6_1441_864/master/1441.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2db663fe11b53e4d677a09ac80e612e","title":"infinite scroll life under instagram","story":"After a few years, I came to understand Instagram dwellers as broken people – my people. By  Dayna TortoriciI had reached the point of diminishing returns. I wanted to quit Twitter, but my fingers were as if possessed, typing command+n, tw, enter at any lull in the workday, letting autofill take care of the rest. Like an old woman who finds herself at a familiar bus stop in her nightgown, I would blink at the new window and wonder how I got there and where I had intended to go. More than once I asked a friend to change my password and lock me out of my account. Weeks would go by without incident, sometimes months, but then a protest would break out, or my hometown would be on fire, and the old media was too slow with the news. I would go through the password retrieval process, log on, catch up, lose my mind and repeat the process.Finally, in July 2018, I thought: I’m going to have a heart attack if I stay on here.I changed my password to thisisamassivewasteoftimeandnotthepurposeofyourlifeonearth.I told a friend that I was banishing myself to Instagram, the only social media platform that did not haunt me, get under my skin and cause me to feel shortness of breath and numbness in my fingers. I had a theory that everyone was haunted by at least one of them, and which one depended on your insecurities, the type of people who gathered there, and the style of communication its interface allowed.I surveyed new acquaintances: “When you think: ‘Social media is terrible,’ which are you thinking of most?” For some the answer was Facebook – people with serious exes, political ambitions, a Trump-supporting family or high school rivals. For me, and for others overwhelmed by the hyper-acceleration of news commentary, it was Twitter.Instagram felt innocent by comparison. No one I knew cared about it or made a living on it. The people who confessed a troubled relationship with the platform were visual artists, which I was not fearful of missing out, which was not my flavour of social anxiety or influencers concerned with a standard of perfection that was not my standard, and so I felt immune. For the most part, Instagram people preached positivity and contentment, and reminded themselves and their followers that the aesthetic harmony attainable in images was fleeting, not sustainable as a way of life. Instagram people did not seem mean or clever. They were earnest and sincere. They drank green smoothies and went on hikes, sought personal bests, good health, peace of mind and oneness with the universe. They believed every day was a beautiful day to be alive. Leaving Twitter for Instagram was like moving to Los Angeles, only cheaper. I knew people who had gone west to convalesce and to retire from public life. Maybe Instagram would be like that for me?By this time I had already been on Instagram for six years – long enough to have developed misgivings about it – but the platform was such a reprieve from the moment’s psychic turmoil that I didn’t dwell on them. To do so would be like spending your holiday researching the detrimental effects of tourism: a wise, just and morally superior choice, but objectively not the point.If I was operating under a willful innocence, it helped that I had started in 2012 with a rule: only follow people you know. Even back then, I felt as if I was being hosed daily with unwanted opinions, ideas, emotions and headlines on Facebook and Twitter, and the idea that I could start afresh with a limited intake made me feel safe. My Instagram account was not private – anyone could follow me – but I kept a tight door on my feed. There was no share, retweet or reblog feature on Instagram people would have to go out of their way to show me things by people I didn’t follow, and most didn’t bother. The network was limited. Nothing I didn’t want to see would appear in the timeline. The environment was still and sane.How did I choose what to post? If I was walking down the street in company and stopped to say: “Sorry, I just have to take a picture of this,” usually that was sufficient. A random, inchoate force was at work – the snap reflex of humour or taste.Posting was its own separate pleasure. I would eventually come to post for attention, like everyone else – but early on, when nobody liked my pictures, I still found it gratifying to post. The satisfaction of self-publishing is difficult to describe. To press a button and see your own excrescence appear in the preordained format, minted, can feel like a kind of magic. It can make you feel like you count. But what people saw from me was less important to my mental health than what I saw of them. Hence the rule to only follow people I knew. For two years, that was a clean, easy test. But in time, I began to relax my definition of an acquaintance. Soon I was looking at a lot of people I had never met and never intended to.Genres of Instagram I came to recognise after this door opened were: archival photography, astrology meme, travel photography, cookingbaking, fitnessexercise, political meme, celebrity superfan, street fashion, makeupdrag, time-lapse photography, architecturedesign, tactile or “satisfying”, cross-platform meme (eg, screenshots from Twitter), female influencer, historical, inspirational, animal rescue, literary, home decor, viral dance, gymnasticacrobatic, ceramic, houseplant care, illustration and softcore pornography.Some trends were easier to decipher than others. For a period of six months, I noticed a number of Americans visiting Portugal and posting pictures of painted tiles. Why did the tiles look so good there? I overthought it for a while and then realised Instagram was already tiles. Why all the houseplants? Because we spend too much time indoors and they photograph well.Each night I lay in my bed beside my boyfriend with one eye closed against the pillow and with the other, wheeled down Instagram’s infinite scroll. Each morning, I woke up to my phone alarm and rolled over to tap it off and, if I had time, looked at Instagram while still half-asleep. I easily spent an hour on it a day – in bed, on the subway or at my desk during lunch. Compared with the hours I spent elsewhere on the internet, it felt like nothing.“What does the egg mean?”World records are meaningless in a culture defined by historical amnesia and the relentless invention of categories, I thought, and double tapped to like the egg.The closest I came to experiencing an Instagram subculture was through following fitness accounts between 2016 and 2018. I was in my late 20s and had rediscovered a passion for exercise. I belonged to a gym but needed things to do, something better than running or cycling. Instagram was a fount of ideas. It was there that I discovered a world of people, mostly women, who worked out all day and were paid in tights and crop tops by athleisure brands to do so.From time to time they cracked. “I look nice and smug in this photo,” said a popular woman powerlifter I liked, “but I’m considering making a YouTube video about my recent nervous breakdownidentity crisis.” Through her, I learned about the mechanics of Facetune, a photo-editing app that allows you to smooth cellulite, shrink waistlines, whiten sclera and disappear acne with little technical skill. I knew about the app from trans women I followed who used it to soften jawlines and erase Adam’s apples, a sort of spot-treatment for dysphoria that brought their likeness closer to the ideal. Their offhand references to Facetune suggested that image manipulation wasn’t empowerment, just something you could control when your health insurance didn’t cover facial feminisation surgery. The athletes, less forthright about their body-image issues, were cagier about their usage.In the powerlifter’s video about Facetune, she said she felt hypocritical for editing her photos while championing body acceptance and strength-building for women. If she couldn’t walk the walk, at least she would talk about it. She was not the only one. Such confessional double-consciousness was everywhere on #fitstagram. Women posted before-and-after photos 60 seconds apart to demonstrate the powerful effects of posing. Before: a slumping, bloated person with her tailbone tucked. After: a composed physique model with a popped heel and a perfect ass. But no matter how much consciousness-raising they did, they were still under the spell of the image and strove to live up to it.I wish I could say I watched this all from a cool, critical distance. In truth, I spent too much time at the gym and worried about my forward head position – an affliction common to people who spend too much time on their phones. My Explore page, which drives users via algorithm toward content similar to what they’ve seen or liked, became a mosaic of increasingly extreme exercisers. Looking at competitive bodybuilders, I caught myself thinking they didn’t look all that weird. This is how dysmorphia works, I thought the algorithm only encourages it, nudging you towards extremity. And yet it cut both ways: the more body-positive accounts I looked at as a counterweight, the more the Explore page fed me body-positive imagery. All images train the eye, and consistent exposure to fat bodies rewires the brain just as much as consistent exposure to thin ones. It brought to mind a moment in Pumping Iron, the 70s bodybuilding documentary, in which a young Arnold Schwarzenegger attempts to explain the mindset of the subculture.“I mean, obviously a lot of people look at you and they think it’s kind of strange, what you’re doing,” he says. “But those are the people who don’t know much about it ... As soon as you find out what the whole thing is about, then it’s just like another thing.”Everything on Instagram was like that. Once you found out about it, it was just another thing.We think we know, but do we really know the full extent of manipulation on this platform, the psychological complexity and the degree of social engineering involved? Yes and no. As of this writing, Instagram has an estimated value of more than $100bn (£77bn), 100 times what Facebook bought it for in 2012. It is a data-collection business and a media-selling business. Third-party indexing tools glean data from what is posted and sell it in the form of brand analytics – or as information for governments, security and surveillance firms, and corporations. Images posted to Instagram are used by Facebook to help train its proprietary image-recognition software. And, of course, Facebook-owned Instagram tracks your movements across the internet, and hints that it is stalking you in ways both subtle and not.Occasionally someone or something lifts the veil. In July 2019, Instagram crashed, and for a brief period users had the unusual experience of scrolling through their feeds and seeing, in the place of images, image-recognition metadata as blue text in pale gray squares. The text read:“Image may contain: night, sky and outdoor”“Image may contain: 1 or more people, people sitting, shoes and indoor”I imagined sentient robots thumbing through photos. This is how they would see us: in Terminator vision.When Instagram introduced advertisements in 2013, it suddenly seemed as if every fifth image in my feed was an ad. Then I counted – every third or fourth post was an ad. With time, they grew uncannily specific. An ad for a bar cart from a furniture startup, on which stood a selection of magazines, including n+1 – the magazine I work for – next to a speckled philodendron. An ad for a minimalist women’s clothing brand based in San Francisco, modelled by the younger sister of a poet I had recently met. I was being reached by Facebook Ads Manager through detailed targeting, which I knew existed: users who like Bon Appétit, live in Brooklyn, between the ages of 18 and 35, should see this ad. But this was being stalked on another level. By the end of 2019, I half expected to see my own likeness in an ad served just to me – me in minimalist clothing, reading n+1, beside a bar cart.What were other people seeing? I realised I had no idea. Whereas I once watched TV ads with interest – especially those geared toward men during the American football games my boyfriend watched, the car commercials and beer commercials and pharmaceutical commercials for hair loss and erectile dysfunction – on Instagram I saw only myself. It was easier to see ideology at work on other people, and at least those TV ads gave me a sense of what strings of the American male psyche advertisers were choosing to pull. Now, I was alone with my ads, in a filter bubble of one.Meanwhile, Instagram was leaving its trace on the physical world. People in search of ’grammable content were mobbing restaurants, public lands and private neighbourhoods in greater numbers, causing their stewards to think differently about design and crowd control. I read an article about Rue Crémieux in Paris, where residents of pastel-painted houses were begging for a gate so tourists would stop taking photos in front of them. “It’s become hell,” the vice-president of the street association told a local news website. “On weekends, we get 200 people outside our windows. Our dinner table is right by the window and people are just outside taking pictures.”An article on NPR suggested Instagram was driving more visitors to national parks in pursuit of the perfect image. In 2018, the article reported: “A California woman fell to her death at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in Michigan while trying to take a selfie.” At Yellowstone in 2015, a woman “was gored by a bison while attempting to get a selfie with the animal”. Park officials created a voluntary pledge for visitors that included the phrase: “No picture is worth hurting yourself, others, or the park.”Land preservation was also a concern. An anonymous curmudgeon started the Instagram account @publiclandshateyou to shame Instagram tourists for their thoughtless treatment of nature reserves and wilderness areas. In spring 2019, Miley Cyrus posted a photo of herself hanging from aJoshua tree, an endangered plant known for its delicate root system. The Mojave Desert Land Trust begged her to take it down.By then it was obvious that Instagram was changing the built environment, too. Cafes, bars and themed fun houses called “museums” were being constructed and designed to appear on the grid. Art museums realised that programming exhibitions with built-in selfie opportunities increased “user-generated content”, or UGC, which, in turn, led to free, “organic” promotion.New storefronts and restaurants were likewise optimised for the image. Considerations such as comfort, accessibility and acoustics were secondary to visual appeal. It was as if the landscape itself had dysmorphia, altering its physical appearance to fit an arbitrary standard that undermined its primary function. But maybe I had it backwards. Maybe the point of a physical space was no longer to shelter physical people. Maybe a shopfront was a marketing tool for a direct-to-consumer internet startup, the way a website was once a marketing tool for a bricks-and-mortar outlet. Glossier. Everlane. Warby Parker. The Sill. Walking into such places felt like walking into an app. They always looked smaller in person, like famous actors who are shorter in real life.By the autumn of 2019, I came to understand Instagram dwellers as broken people – my people. If I was getting depressed, so was everyone else. The algorithm’s hall-of-mirrors effect seemed to be at work again: more and more people were posting about staying in, struggling with their mental health and finding a community of fellow sufferers on the platform. But it wasn’t just me and my algorithm. Other people were growing disenchanted and reclusive, and the media seemed to confirm the trend. Tavi Gevinson, the American writer and the co-founder of Rookie, published a New York magazine cover story chronicling her ambivalence about growing up on Instagram. The Atlantic claimed The New Instagram It Girl Spends All Her Time Alone and described how influencers were staging more selfies at home to appear relatable to their followers. Home-delivery services, loungewear brands and weighted-blanket manufacturers were all well poised to capitalise.Then I encountered the Agoraphobic Traveller. At a live storytelling event I attended, the MC cued the lights for a message from the sponsor. The stage lights dimmed and a four-minute video told the story of Jacqui, a fortysomething woman with a thick New Zealand accent who had started having severe panic attacks in her 20s. “Eventually I was diagnosed with agoraphobia,” she said in voiceover as the camera caught her face through a windowpane. For a while, she struggled to travel far from home. “It’s not living life. It’s not a life, when you’re just constantly not in a good place.”Then she hit a turning point. Jacqui was looking at Google Street View one day when she thought to take screenshots of vistas or tableaux she liked. “I’ve always loved photography,” she said. “This gave me the opportunity to be a photographer but without having that anxious feeling. I think that I’ve taken around 27,000 screenshots,” she told the camera.Jacqui created an Instagram account, @streetview.portraits, to share the screenshots she took. In the video, the camera showed Jacqui looking at one of her Instagram posts, a washed-out image of two camels in the desert, scrolling over the comments. “Now I feel more connected to the world than I ever have before,” she said.With help from Google, Jacqui travelled to New York for an exhibition of her photos in Soho called The Agoraphobic Traveller. The video showed Jacqui in a cab, Jacqui on the plane. The camera trailed her arriving at the gallery, her shoulders hiked and hands in her pockets. Inside, she smiled and relaxed. “If you’re struggling and you’re keeping it to yourself ... it definitely doesn’t help,” she said. “Please don’t give up, know that it can get better and it does get better.”I was happy for Jacqui, but the video disturbed me deeply. I found it pernicious and thought about it for days. The message was benign – technology connects you to the world. But I couldn’t shake the subtext: that if Google and Instagram had an ideal user, it might be a creative person who could not – would not – leave her home.Modern voyeurism has precedents, even the multiple-window kind. In Alfred Hitchcock’s Rear Window, LB “Jeff” Jefferies is a housebound magazine photographer laid up with a broken leg and “nothing to do but look out the window”. Across the courtyard is a dollhouse of parallel lives that he can watch unfold from his wheelchair. There’s the blond “bikini bombshell” – “Miss Torso”, he calls her – who stretches and twirls in her underwear while she butters her breakfast toast Mr Thorwald, the costume jewellery salesman, who tends a flower garden and a sick, unhappy wife “Miss Lonelyhearts,” a single woman who pantomimes a candlelit dinner for two before she drinks and cries herself to sleep and other nameless neighbours who are less intriguing but still worth watching.The view from Jeff’s rear window calls to mind Henry James’s “house of fiction”, which “has not one window but a million”. It also recalls the view from Instagram. As Durga Chew-Bose writes in an essay on the film: “Jeff sits and stares out his window like we sit and scroll, and double tap.” He spins stories about his neighbours, like we do “about strangers ... based on their Instagram accounts.” The ethical implications were fraught then as now. “We’ve become a race of Peeping Toms,” says Stella, the insurance company nurse who checks in on Jeff and admonishes him. “What people ought to do is get outside their own house and look in for a change. Yes, sir. How’s that for a bit of homespun philosophy?”The entangled dynamics of who sees whom and who knows they’re being seen have always been present. Where Instagram seems truly new – beyond the introduction of machine learning and commercial surveillance to the mix – is in the strange instability of the viewer’s position as a subject. A voyeur knows what kind of viewer he is, but looking at Instagram, you are not always a voyeur. Neither are you always a witness, nor any other single kind of watcher. Your implied identity slips with each stroke of the thumb.If you are me, scrolling through Instagram, you are the confidant being whispered to by a face shot from under the chin. You are the recipient of a holiday card from a family in matching turtlenecks. You are the magazine subscriber flipping through editorials. You are the woman standing in front of the screen miming the aerobic movements of your instructor. You are the mother, adult height, looking down at her child. You are the lunch companion peering across the table. You are the customer browsing for deals. You are the scholar sifting through archives. You are the fan admiring Beyoncé. You are the mirror, reflecting the image of the photographer. You are the photographer, seeing through her eyes. You are the phone.Or you are the voyeur at the window, trying to get a closer look – in which case the villain who enters your private space, not through the window, but through the front door, is the ads.A week into writing this essay, I began to see ads about it on Instagram. The bar cart came back, this time with different magazines on the shelf. So did the “life-transforming, plant-rich super meals delivered to your door”, a remnant from my fitness moment, and the forward-head-position posture corrector, a piece of plastic you stick to your spine that buzzes whenever you slouch. I was served an ad for a New York Times article about facial-recognition technology, and an ad for the Wall Street Journal featuring an illustration of a teen girl in bed looking despondent in bed a phone on the bedside table showed two girls smiling and surrounded by hearts. The caption read: “Young Americans have become unwitting guinea pigs in today’s huge, unplanned experiment with social media, and teenage girls are bearing much of the brunt.”The US government has been slow to respond to the scope of this experiment. The EU has been more aggressive. In response to pressure from regulators, Facebook is now more transparent about data. For the first time, I can see the names of companies who have uploaded my information to the platform: Predictive Media Analytics LLC, Nielsen, LiveRamp, Acxiom, Adara, Oracle Data Cloud, Wunderman Data Products, SocialCode, TowerData. The company has also given users some measure of control over ad settings.Following the directions in an article I found online, I switched Ads based on data from other partners – meaning data about websites I had visited or purchases I had made on my credit card – to Not allowed. I switched Ads based on your activity on Facebook Company Products that you see elsewhere, which I didn’t understand, to Not allowed. I switched Ads that include your social actions, meaning ads telling friends I liked certain products, to be shown to No One. Overnight, my Instagram ads became delightfully random.But my life as a generic nontarget, a recipient of ads for Amazon influencers, corny T-shirts and trashy iPhone games, was short lived. I simply spent too much time on Instagram for it not to relearn what it knew before I wiped the slate. I wish I could wipe it again.The speed of machine learning is startling, often creepy. It is hard to tell what is creepier: the feeling that someone is somewhere out there, following your every step, or the fact that no one is, just the tracking device you carry with you in your pocket. I still give Instagram an hour a day, for the intermittent pleasure it brings. A built-in timer reminds me when my time is up.Late at night in bed, I get an ad for a meditation app meant to aid with sleep. It’s midnight and I’m browsing Instagram stories.Addicted to Instagram? says the ad.Below is a poll with two options: Yes and How’d you know.• This is an edited version of a longer article originally published by nplusonemag• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6935485c5077ec71b3f6a3a894daae4dff0cd376/0_239_4177_2507/master/4177.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4f93eda007a0039385aef6be589871a","title":"across china cities turn into ghost towns as coronavirus infects more than 10000","story":"Last week, in the last few days of China’s lunar new year holiday, the streets of Beijing were decorated with fairy lights and glowing red lanterns, but eerily empty. Normally busy restaurant and bar strips were dark. Residential compounds, often lax in their security, closed their gates, with guards ordering anyone entering to register and have their temperature taken. Public buses carried only a few passengers. Those restaurants that were open were mostly empty, with only small groups of diners. At Beijing Capital airport, staff, including some health workers in full hazmat suits, outnumbered passengers.“It’s weird,” said Li, 42, a teacher from Beijing who has remained in the city since the outbreak of the coronavirus. “This isn’t Beijing. Beijing always has a lot of people. Right now the roads, restaurants and malls are all empty.” She spends her days at home cooking and eating, occasionally going to the shop for supplies.Authorities are implementing “grid-style management” – total coverage – to uncover infections in communities. Over the past week, neighbourhood committees have knocked on doors, asking residents whether anyone in their household has recently visited Wuhan, the provincial capital where the virus is believed to have originated, or surrounding areas in Hubei province. Police have called to check on those in Beijing with Wuhan hukou, or household registrations.In a city that attracts millions of workers from across the vast country, paranoia about outsiders has increased. Districts outside Beijing have set up checkpoints, and some villages have created their own de facto quarantines, ordering residents not to leave and barring anyone from coming in. Before the end of the national holiday on Sunday, officials have tried to persuade local residents not to treat those returning for work or school with hostility.“As long as they have not been confirmed with the virus and there are no obvious signs of fever or cough, returnees should be allowed to freely enter and leave the community,” Zhao Jigui, deputy director of the Beijing municipal civil affairs bureau, said last Friday, referring to the districts or neighbourhoods where residents live. “Each district is a family and we must support each other,” Zhao added.Across China, cities have turned into ghost towns as residents cloister themselves at home to avoid the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 200 people and infected almost 10,000 as it has reached every province, territory and municipality in China, as well as 19 other countries.As the crisis, now declared a global health emergency, widens and more countries issue travel warnings for China, or cut off transport links, frustration and anxiety, as well as boredom, have grown.“I haven’t been outside in a week,” said Yang, 39, an entrepreneur based in Shanghai who lives with his wife and newborn child. “I’m on self-imposed house arrest. I just don’t want to bring it back to the house.”In Hubei province, the heart of the outbreak, where most of the deaths have occurred, residents live an even more isolated life. In a county near Huanggang, the worst-hit city after Wuhan, Li, 31, who works at a bank, has been at home with her parents for a week. The roads are shut.Every day she hears a loudspeaker twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon advising residents not to go out. The neighbourhood committee visits residents every day to check on them. Two families in her neighbourhood – a couple who recently visited Wuhan and another who’ve been to Huanggang, a city a few kilometres east – have signs on their doors advising other residents not to visit.Whenever a family member takes the rubbish out, one of the few times they leave, they are disinfected as soon as they return. Li is most anxious about the risks health workers are taking and the lack of supplies at hospitals. “I dare not look at the news. Every day people are dying,” she said.In the face of public anger over what many see as the government’s slow and ham-fisted response to an outbreak first detected on 8 December, Chinese authorities have tried to appear decisive and transparent.After widespread traffic restrictions that put about 50 million people in Hubei province under lockdown, Chinese leader Xi Jinping described the coronavirus epidemic as a demon. “We cannot let this demon hide,” he said on Tuesday, promising the “timely release of information” domestically and internationally. Following a directive vowing to hold local officials accountable, a health official in Huanggang was fired.But criticism and mistrust have grown. Chinese internet users say officials are “tossing the pot”, or passing the buck, by blaming other departments or other officials for the crisis. Reports of desperate conditions in Hubei, where many residents have told of not being able to get help or reach hospitals where staff are overworked and undersupplied, have only increased public anger.China’s Red Cross, in charge of all donations, has come under fire for distributing only an eighth of funds it has received, even as a doctor in Wuhan said that his hospital had run out of protective medical equipment. Photos posted online showed staff making protective gear out of garbage bags and bedsheets. A 17-year-old boy with cerebral palsy reportedly died from hunger in Huanggang last week after his father and brother were quarantined.A study published on Wednesday compounded the frustrations. The study in The New England Journal of Medicine used data from the first 425 cases in Wuhan and found evidence of human-to-human transmission in mid-December. Until 20 January, Chinese officials had insisted that there was no evidence the disease was transmissible by humans and that the virus was still manageable.“What is the cost of being lied to? It’s not that we will mistake lies for truth. The real danger is that if we listen to too many lies, we can no longer recognise facts,” read one of the most popular comments in response to the study. “We don’t care who the heroes are. All we want to know is whose fault this is.”Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73c712204d430db39b85f95e868495cfea4cb5e6/0_232_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=755d17fe8478c2c31503de2cf68cc62e","title":"coronavirus two uk york university student","story":"Two members of the same family are being treated at a specialist unit in NewcastleOne of the first two people to test positive for coronavirus in the UK is a student at the University of York.The pair – two members of the same family – are being treated at a specialist unit in Newcastle. They had checked into the Staycity apartment-hotel in York on Wednesday and were taken to hospital that evening.Health chiefs confirmed on Friday that two people had tested positive for the virus, which has killed 259 people in China.The university’s vice-chancellor, Prof Charlie Jeffery, said: “Our immediate concerns are for the affected student and family, along with the health and continued wellbeing of our students, staff, and the residents and visitors of our city.“We understand this development will cause concern and anxiety. I want to reassure our students, staff and the wider community that we are working closely with the lead agency, Public Health England, and other agencies to manage this situation.”He stressed that the university would continue to operate as normal. “I want to reiterate to students, staff, parents and visitors that we’re working with our partners across the city to ensure that York and the university remain a safe and welcoming place to live, work and visit.”The university students’ union president, Samara Jones, said many students were likely to be worried by the news. “The student community at York is a tight-knit, global community and we will continue to support one another at this time,” she said. “I would encourage students with any questions to keep an eye on the university website for any developments and key information. Our dedicated helpline will remain open over the weekend.” A spokesman confirmed that the university was continuing to operate as normal. He said: “We are monitoring the situation closely and we continue to provide as much advice, care and support as we can to our university community. If people have any concerns about their health in relation to suspected coronavirus, we ask that they follow current PHE advice and contact NHS 111.”Staycity said the apartment involved had been thoroughly disinfected and that PHE had been providing support.The patients are being treated by Newcastle-upon-Tyne hospitals NHS foundation trust in its specialist Airborne High Consequences Infectious Disease Centre (HCID).Prof Sharon Peacock said PHE was contacting people who had close contact – defined as being within two metres of the infected person for 15 minutes – with the pair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8667c5216861022915bd1da2148079d196c2675/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=280f6b2bad9ee276aa6a6bbb35b7b7c8","title":"every day it got worse evacuee describes wuhan lockdown","story":"The English teacher now faces two weeks in quarantine in Wirral after evacuation from the Chinese cityFollow the latest developments A English teacher who has lived in Wuhan for the last four years described his long journey back to the UK after being evacuated on Friday.Speaking from his room at Arrowe Park Hospital, Wirral, where he and 82 other Britons will be quarantined for two weeks in NHS staff accommodation, he said he was “very tired” after a 30 hour journey but grateful to have been evacuated.The 32-year-old man, who asked not to be named, described the facilities where he was staying: “It’s like being in a crap hotel or a student halls of residence. I haven’t actually asked but I suspect I’m not really supposed to come out here in the next 14 days. It’s alright though. It will be OK.”It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals, or possibly seafood. New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are examples.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.The virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died are known to have been already in poor health.Human to human transmission has been confirmed by China’s national health commission. As of January 30, the death toll in China stands at 170, with 7,711 confirmed cases of infections. In the past week, the number of confirmed infections has more than tripled and cases have been found in 13 provinces, as well as the municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin. The virus has also been confirmed outside\u0026nbspChina, in Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the US, and Vietnam. There have been two confirmed cases in the UK. The actual number to have contracted the virus could be far higher as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by WHO experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.There were fears that the coronavirus might spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese travel home to celebrate, but the festivities have largely been cancelled and Wuhan and other Chinese cities are in lockdown.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat there is generally no need to visit a doctor for a cough unless it is persistent or you are having other symptoms such as chest pain, difficulty breathing or you feel very unwell.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. It increases the likelihood that the World\u0026nbspHealth\u0026nbspOrganization will declare the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on Thursday evening. The key concerns are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital.The Wamos Air Boeing 747 plane carrying the Britons to the UK from Wuhan landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on Friday lunchtime.The evacuees then boarded coaches and were taken up to Wirral. “I don’t know how long it took but it felt like forever,” he said. “At that point, we had been travelling for a day. My back was aching and I really wasn’t in a good mood any more.”Once they arrived, they were processed and taken to their rooms. The teacher said a nurse, who was wearing a face mask and not a full hazmat suit, brought him a sandwich and some custard cream biscuits. “I hadn’t had a custard cream in four years so that was quite a nice treat.“Everyone has been really nice to be fair. I think they are mostly nurses. We haven’t been given health checks yet though … We have been told that a friend and family contact centre will be set up on Saturday and also that we will be supported back to our home after the 14 days.”Two of the man’s friends were also evacuated at the same time. He said it was “definitely the right move for us to leave as it felt like we were at the centre of the new ebola outbreak”.The teacher described his last week in Wuhan while in lockdown as “really really horrible.“It was a mixture of boredom and uncertainty. Every day it got worse. It didn’t get better and although the odds of you getting infected were statistically very low, if it did happen, I was worried about what to do because the hospitals aren’t the best.”He said that around four days ago, it started to sound in conversations with the Foreign Office crisis phone line service as if Britons in Wuhan would be evacuated, but it was all “very very up in the air”.He added that he found out a lot of the details of the evacuation through the British media, but didn’t blame the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for the poor communication.The teacher said: “I think they were excellent. They didn’t communicate that well before we were met to to go the airport but things don’t work the same in Asia as they do over here and I think they were cooperating with a fairly uncooperative authority. Since we met them to go to the airport they were really good and did everything on point.”There was a tense moment at the toll booth near the airport in Wuhan where the buses were stopped by military police before finally being allowed through. The delay took around four hours.“The whole thing was kind of scary at the time,” the teacher said. “But it was more boring than anything else.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fedc753a5cbcab449389d06d1ac063673a7c2b2c/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91299a1f5a08cf0e0975a8f36f6f7f69","title":"fukushima radioactive water should be released into ocean say japan experts","story":"Build-up of contaminated water from wrecked nuclear plant has been sticking point in clean-up likely to take decadesA panel of experts advising Japan’s government on a disposal method for radioactive water from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant has recommended releasing it into the ocean, a move likely to alarm neighbouring countries.The panel, under the industry ministry, came to the conclusion after narrowing the choice to either releasing the contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean or letting it evaporate – and opted for the former. Based on past practice, it is likely the government will accept the recommendation.The build-up of contaminated water at Fukushima has been a sticking point in the clean-up, which is likely to last decades, especially as the Olympics are due to be held in Tokyo this year with some events less than 60km (35 miles) from the wrecked plant.Neighbouring South Korea has retained a ban on imports of seafood from Japan’s Fukushima region imposed after the nuclear disaster and summoned a senior Japanese embassy official last year to explain how the Fukushima water would be dealt with. Its athletes are planning to bring their own radiation detectors and food to the Games.In 2018, Tokyo Electric apologised after admitting its filtration systems had not removed all dangerous material from the water, and the site is running out of room for storage tanks.But it plans to remove all radioactive particles from the water except tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that is hard to separate and is considered to be relatively harmless.“Compared to evaporation, ocean release can be done more securely,” the committee said, pointing to common practice around the world where normally operating nuclear stations release water that contains tritium into the sea.The recommendation needs to be confirmed by the head of the panel, Nagoya University professor emeritus Ichiro Yamamoto, and submitted to the government at a later date that has not been set.Tokyo Electric, or Tepco, has collected nearly 1.2m tonnes of contaminated water from the cooling pipes used to keep fuel cores from melting since the plant was crippled by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011. The water is stored in huge tanks that crowd the site.The utility says it will run out of room to store the water by 2022.

We are delighted to welcome the country and its people back to the Commonwealth.“The reform process under way in Males aligns with the values and principles of the Commonwealth and we encourage the nation to continue on this path. Commonwealth members were pleased to note these developments and are happy once again to count Males as a member of the family. Together we will support Males to realise its ambitions.”Lady Scotland consulted the other Commonwealth nations, who all had to agree to Males’ readmission for it to go ahead.The Indian Ocean archipelago – home to about 500,000 people – is formed of nearly 1,200 islands, most of them uninhabited. It is known for its sandy white beaches and luxury tourist resorts.During his election campaign, Solih vowed to promote human rights and, since his surprise win, political prisoners have been freed and exiled opposition figures have returned to the islands.Within months of taking power, he wrote to the secretary general expressing interest in rejoining the Commonwealth, before making an official application.Solih said: “Today is a happy day for Malians as we return to the family of Commonwealth nations. As a young democracy, the Commonwealth’s foundational values of the promotion of democracy, human rights, good governance, multilateralism and world peace remain relevant to us more than ever.“We gratefully acknowledge the support and help of the Commonwealth to the Malian democratic movement, and we look forward to the support of fellow member states to ensure the long-term entrenchment of these values in our society.”The country faced an assessment including two site visits and consultations, in accordance with the rules and procedures agreed by the Commonwealth heads of government in Kampala in 2007.In 2016, the Males government quit the global body under former president Abdulla Yameen, saying it had been treated “unjustly and unfairly”.The country had been threatened with sanctions including suspension if it failed to show progress in leading democratic governance issues, including the prompt release of political leaders and misuse of anti-terrorism legislation.Yameen, who was elected in 2013, was accused of a crackdown on political rivals, courts and the media. But he was replaced by opposition leader Solih after a shock election result in 2018.The islands, which became a multi-party democracy in 2008 after decades of autocratic rule, had been in political turmoil since its first democratically elected president, Mohamed Nasheed, announced his resignation in 2012, after a mutiny by the police and weeks of demonstrations against his order to arrest a senior judge.

These efforts accelerated after Chinese academics publicly posted the genetic sequence for the virus.A research team at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Maryland said they had prepared a modified version of a key section of the virus to encourage the body to produce antibodies against the disease.As well as the NIH, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) has announced it would commit $11m (£8.4m) to three programmes led by the companies Inovio Pharmaceuticals and Moderna, and the University of Queensland, with the hope of having a viable vaccine in production within 16 weeks, although testing for safety and efficacy will take much longer.With different teams competing to produce a trial vaccine, it remains unclear who is leading the race.Kizzmekia Corbett, lead researcher on the NIH coronavirus vaccine team, said her group had been concentrating on the spike proteins – the spear point of the virus,. This built on work done during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak that first emerged in China in 2001, another coronavirus thought to be similar to the Wuhan virus.The virus looks like a knobbly ball covered in protrusions that widen at the tip. These are spike proteins, which are able to dock to a receptor found in the lung membrane known as ACE-2, which allows the virus to enter the body.Corbett said that since the release of the Chinese sequence on 10 January, her team had been working around the clock to produce a stable version of the key protein that would prompt a strong antibody defence to prevent the virus entering the body.She said: “Coronaviruses are generally just a large family of pathogens of which six – well, now seven – are infectious to humans.“We had already published research on Sars and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and shown we could drop some stabilising mutations into the backbone of the spike after a colleague did this with the S protein of the respiratory syncytial virus,” she added.“Since 2017 we have been looking at how you give the body the right kind of messenger RNA that will attract the right type of cells to produce the right type of antibodies to produce a potent vaccine. We’ve been doing these sequences for the last three years now so we can basically plug and play, and are now able to look at any coronavirus spike sequence.”One of the problems, said Corbett, is that the corona spike protein is the largest of its kind to infect humans. “One of the reasons it’s so hard to look at is because is is so big and floppy,” she said.Corbett believed the previous work done at her institute and others may have reduced the timeframe for producing an effective vaccine. “We don’t want to ignite public hope but the goal is do it as fast as we can and we are working day and night. I lost 7lb in recent weeks!”The NIH team is among several that have been working on solutions to the wider problem of coronaviruses since the first emergence of Sars. Many of the teams noted that vaccine work would be further advanced if not for the loss of interest in research after the Sars outbreak was brought under control.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.Peter Hotez, a professor at Baylor University in Texas who was involved in the search for a Sars vaccine, said the problem was not making a vaccine but safety-testing and licensing the product.“The receptor for the virus is in the cells of the lungs and allows the virus to get deep into lung tissue. People who are sick get severe viral pneumonia and for reasons we don’t entirely understand, those who are more vulnerable are older iniduals including those with diabetes and hypertension.“Right now, you can look at four to five different techniques being examined by researchers to produce a vaccine. The problem is that is even after manufacturing a vaccine, you still have to go through the safety testing on humans – clinical trials as well as formal toxicology testing in animals. It’s hard to rush and that’s where you tend to get a bottleneck.“The big issue is encouraging an immune response that stops the virus binding to the host receptor.There’s no magic bullet, however, he warned. “Each of the different approaches has an advantage and disadvantage. Sars was a wake-up call nearly 20 years ago. We’ve got better at implementing global health regulations and detection monitoring, no question. But even then it’s hard to anticipate a new pathogen.”“But the one thing the world missed was that we should have been more aware of the risks of coronaviruses. This is the third outbreak to emerge in the 21st century.“There’s a message here. We need to pay the same attention to coronaviruses as we do to flu. What’s so tragic is that once Sars was gone, the investor enthusiasm for a Sars vaccine was zero. If the global health community had followed through and produced and stockpiled a vaccine, something might have been ready to go now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/903ab67cf1a136dea720e9ee2b0c0ae1c7a11b87/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e6716f2ce9b373499d45d656c0609a2","title":"el salvador femicide sentence karla turcios","story":"The boyfriend of a murdered Salvadoran journalist has been found guilty of femicide and given the maximum 50-year prison sentence on Friday, a rare conviction in the deadly gender violence that often goes unpunished in the Central American nation.Mario Huezo was convicted by a judge of killing Karla Turcios, with whom he lived and had a child with, after a nine-day trial in a court that hears gender violence cases in San Salvador.The murder of Turcios in 2018 made headlines and prompted the government to declare a national emergency against femicide – the killing of a woman by a man because of her gender.El Salvador, a country of 6 million people, has one of the world’s highest rates of femicide, according to the United Nations.El Salvador passed a law in 2012 to define and punish femicide as a specific crime with a longer sentence than murder, with prison terms for convicted offenders of 20 to 50 years.The law requires prosecutors to prove the motive for a woman’s murder was hatred or contempt based on gender.Turcios, 33, whose beaten body was found dumped on a roadside, became a household name and symbol of the violence women face in El Salvador that often goes unpunished.A woman in El Salvador was murdered on average every three days in 2019, and prosecutors opened investigations into 148 cases of femicides last year, official figures show.“The conviction sends a message of intolerance toward forms of violence against women,” Silvia Juárez, a women’s rights activist in El Salvador, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “It sends a message to the rest of the population.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55fc7011964d023c022b7eab9049eb1b1cd6655d/0_148_5208_3124/master/5208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91d08c6f8c5225e9c96fec19dc203258","title":"two people in britain test positive for coronavirus","story":"Health officials tracing anyone at risk from Chinese nationals being treated in NewcastlePublic Health England (PHE) is urgently trying to trace anyone who came into contact with the two people who have tested positive for the coronavirus in the UK.England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said: “We can confirm that two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive. The patients are receiving specialist NHS care and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus.”It is understood that the pair travelled to the UK from China recently and are believed to be Chinese nationals. They are undergoing treatment at the specialist Airborne High Consequence Infectious Diseases Centre in Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary.Cases in the UK have long been expected. The virus has already spread to 22 other countries outside China.The pair had been at the StayCity apartment hotel in York when they became ill. A StayCity spokesman said: “We have been advised by Public Health England that there is minimal ongoing risk of infection to either guests or staff, and as such our York property remains open for business. The apartment concerned will undergo a thorough environmental clean and disinfection by a specialist contractor.”Public Health England (PHE) is urgently trying to trace anyone who came into contact with the two people. It said steps would be taken to reduce the risk to the public and it was “identifying the areas where there is deemed to be a risk”.Professor Sharon Peacock, director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said: “Public Health England is contacting people who had close contact with the confirmed cases. Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases.”Prof Peacock previously said that while staff are working to trace people who have been in contact with the pair, they do not currently have any idea of how high that number might be.The PHE definition of close contact is being within two metres of the infected person for 15 minutes.Guests were continuing to check in for weekend breaks in York on Friday. Outside the hotel, two guests told the  that as recently as Friday morning they had been told by reception staff that reports that two tourists had been taken ill from their apartment on Wednesday were “lies”.“This morning they said it was a lie and not to listen to it,” said Andy Neale, 21, who was staying at StayCity for the night with his girlfriend. “It’s not ideal. They should’ve taken some precaution.”He said the incident had marred the couple’s getaway. “My girlfriend is stressing out, she’s using hand wipes on everything.”A family who were staying in the hotel on a visit from Asia to see their daughter, who is a student in York, said they had been told the reports of cases were “false information”.The PHE supported the decision not to close the hotel. It said: “The design of the accommodation means that there is minimal interaction between guests and, following a risk assessment by our experts, closing the accommodation was not necessary. Appropriate infection and prevention control measures are being implemented.”Earlier, Whitty said: “The NHS is extremely well prepared and used to managing infections, and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had to prevent further spread.“We have been preparing for UK cases of novel coronavirus and we have robust infection control measures in place to respond immediately. We are continuing to work closely with the World Health Organization and the international community as the outbreak in China develops to ensure we are ready for all eventualities.”The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.The chief medical officers for the four countries of the UK raised the risk level from low to moderate on Thursday evening in the wake of the WHO declaring coronavirus to be an international emergency. The UK has been on high alert for days, with 177 people tested for the virus, of whom 175 proved negative.In recent days ambulance workers and paramedics have been seen in protective suits in a number of places. As well as the York incident, a man was taken away from student accommodation in London. The University of Bristol said one person admitted to hospital with symptoms as a precaution had been discharged after being cleared of coronavirus.The UK had comprehensive plans in place for dealing with the arrival of the Wuhan coronavirus. It also has a good track record. Several cases of Mers – Middle East respiratory syndrome, which is also caused by a coronavirus – have been diagnosed in the past in travellers and in two healthcare workers who were infected by patients before anyone realised they had the virus. All were nursed in hospital infectious disease units and recovered.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: “The report of the first two cases diagnosed positive for 2019-nCoV in the UK is not surprising and was almost inevitable. The chief medical officer’s statement gives no information on where these two members of the same family acquired their infection. The two cases are members of the same family but no information has been released about whether both cases will have been infected simultaneously or whether one would have passed the infection to the other.“The NHS is well able to nurse people with this novel coronavirus as it has successfully and safely managed a number of cases of both Sars and Mers in the past. With the information available it is not possible to judge what risk if any there may be of spread within the community.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda\u0026iacute investigating attack in which victim suffered \u0026lsquostab-type\u0026rsquo injuries on FridayVideo ruling out coalition with Sinn F\u0026eacutein is deployed by rival parties for ridiculeFine Gael\u0026rsquos plans to reduce emissions by 2 per cent a year are \u0026lsquonot enough\u0026rsquo, says RyanBruton takes pole position in Dublin Bay North while Healy-Rae wants high officeGarda\u0026iacute seized \u0026euro8k in cash, \u0026euro76k of suspected cannabis herb and growing equipmentTwo brothers arrested by detectives in early morning raid on house in Wilton areaCoveney criticises Sinn F\u0026eacutein for promoting \u0026lsquoisive\u0026rsquo class politicsCork Corporation was first local authority in Cork to pledge allegiance to D\u0026aacuteil \u0026EacuteireannFocus groups suggest Fine Gael faces a struggle in final week of campaignDUP leader calls for \u0026lsquoneighbourly relations\u0026rsquo during appearance on RT\u0026Eacute\u0026rsquos Late Late ShowSinn F\u0026eacutein MEP, who lost parliament job at 11pm, says unity poll offers obvious path backAnti-Brexit protests taking place in Co Louth, outside Stormont and along the BorderSinn F\u0026eacutein accuses London of \u0026lsquobad faith\u0026rsquo and attempting to create \u0026lsquohierarchy of victims\u0026rsquoFridays for Future presents list of nine climate demands to Fine Gael and Fianna F\u0026aacuteilDecision was unanimously ratified by the North\u0026rsquos Policing BoardEmergency Aeromedical Service cut back last year to ease staffing pressuresFG tried and trusted on Brexit, says Varadkar"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4159105.1580577694!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the man who fought for three armies british ira and free state","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMartin Doyle at a garden party  at Buckingham Palace for Victoria Cross recipients in June 1920, four months before he joined the IRA.The people of New Ross in Co Wexford will on Sunday honour Victoria Cross winner Martin Doyle who returned to the town as a war hero 100 years ago and later joined the IRA.There will be a parade through the streets of the town before the unveiling of a paving stone recognising the medal he earned in September 1918. Ronan McGreevy tells the story of a man who came to embody the shifting loyalties of Irish people a century ago.There are 623 graves for British military personnel in Grangegorman Military Cemetery in Dublin. Each headstone is identical to the other being, according to the old imperial measures, 30 inches (76 cm) tall, 15 inches (38 cm) wide and two inches (3.2 cm) thick. They are made of white Portland Stone.The grave of Martin Doyle, tucked into a corner at the entrance of the graveyard, looks like all the rest, but it is not a real Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone.Its provenance revealed by the inscription at the bottom - “erected by his old comrades in the regiment” - the regiment being the Royal Munster Fusiliers.In his short, but eventful life, Martin Doyle fought for three armies, the British Army, the IRA and the National Army of the Free State. Yet, he was buried as a British soldier, 20 years after his country fought a war of liberation against the same country.In death, as in life, this extraordinary soldier personified many of the contradictions of Irish identity in the country he grew up in.Doyle was born on October 25th 1894, in the village of Gusserane, close to New Ross.He was the son of Larry Doyle, a small farmer, and his wife Bridget.Educated at schools in Gusserane and nearby Cushinstown, he left national school in 4th class, his attestation papers show. On St Stephen’s Day 1909, he joined the Royal Irish Regiment.He had only recently turned 15 but he lied to the authorities that he was two years older. It is unsurprising that somebody of Doyle’s social status would wish to join the British army.In 1881, an Irishman could earn £25 a year as an agricultural labourer but £40 a year as a private in the British army. The army guaranteed lodgings, a full belly, clothing, steady employment, an outside chance of promotion, a modest pension and foreign adventure.It was not a political act for those who signed up, despite the protestations of some nationalists who considered it tantamount to treason.The average Irish recruit to the British army was a “Catholic, poor, sometimes of an adventurous bellicose sort, apolitical and he saw himself as a soldier by occupation”, history professor Peter Karsten surmised in his 1983 paper ‘Irish Soldiers in the British Army 1792-1922’.Karsten states that Irishmen in the nineteenth century did not join the British army it was simply ‘the army’. It was as much their army as anyone else’s. He concluded, “Seven centuries of British rule, of one sort or another, had led most Irish people to accept the fact that, like it or not, they were part of the United Kingdom”.Foreign serviceAfter Doyle’s father discovered his son was in the army at such a young age, he sold a cow to buy him out. Doyle left, but then returned to the army for good. For him, soldiering was a vocation. His father would later go on to become one of his biggest champions.Research by businessman and politician Lord Ashcroft, who owns Doyle’s Victoria Cross medal, shows that the Irishman served in India in 1913, where he won both the regimental lightweight boxing title and an elephant in a local raffle.In August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of the Great War, when he was still only 19, Doyle was transferred to the Royal Dublin Fusiliers. He went to France with his new regiment in December 1914 and served in some of the early campaigns. He was promoted to sergeant in 1916, and switched to the 1st battalion of the Royal Munster Fusiliers.In March 1918 he won the first of the two medals which would secure his fame as one of the bravest British soldiers of the first World War.The Royal Munster Fusiliers were part of the 16th (Irish) Division which was destroyed during the German Spring Offensive. The ision bore the full brunt of the German assault which began on March 21st, 1918 and ended with the Battle of Amiens on April 8th, 1918 in which they were stopped outside the critical railway juncture.The 16th (Irish) Division sustained 572 dead, of whom 439 were from what is now the Republic of Ireland, according to historian Tom Burnell. The 36th (Ulster) Division listed 250 dead in the same period.By the time the 16th Division was relieved on April 3rd, it had suffered 7,149 casualties, among them more than 1,000 dead.“Just got back from the line, taking up a draft,” wrote Max Staniforth, an officer with the 16th (Irish) Division 10 days after the initial assault. “The ision has ceased to exist. Wiped off the map. They took the Boche attack full smack, the first day they were in the trenches.”On March 24th, 1918 Doyle showed such bravery in northern France when capturing a barn held by a German gun crew that he was awarded the Military Medal (MM).The military medal was introduced by the British Government in 1916 to honour non-commissioned officers and those from the ranks.Doyle later described his part in the action in Hattenville to an Irish newspaper, The Free Press: “We had to cross about 1,000 yards of open country, exposed to terrible shell and machine-gun fire. A big barn stood in the ground between us and a fight ensued to take possession of it.“I called for volunteers and went over the top at the charge but when I reached the barn I was alone. I bayoneted the two Germans I found there, seized the machine-gun, and took possession of the barn.”PromotedDoyle was promoted to Acting Company Sergeant Major in August 1918. The following month, near Reincourt in France, he led a group of his men to safety, prevented German soldiers from storming a tank and then single-handedly rushed a machine-gun nest capturing three prisoners. For this he he was awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest award for gallantry in the British Army.Doyle “set the very highest example to all ranks by his courage and total disregard of danger”, his citation published in the London Gazette read.He gave his own account of what happened to The Free Press newspaper though it would have been more appropriate for Boy’s Own magazine.Going to the aid of a British tank crew who were in wounded behind enemy lines, Doyle rushed a German trench.“I had gone about 20 yards when I met a German officer with a machine gun under his arm. He shouted at me in English, ‘Hands up!’ and I shot him through the chest with a revolver.”Doyle then bayoneted three German soldiers before evacuating the badly wounded British tank sergeant. “I got him on my back and carried him to a place of safety,” recalled Doyle, who was just 5 foot six inches in height and 10 stone, according to his attestation papers for the army.After the war he spent three months in demobilisation work in France eventually returning to New Ross in March 1919 as a war hero.In June 1919, and still dressed in his Royal Munster Fusiliers uniform, he received the Victoria Cross from King George V at Buckingham Palace. A month later he left the British army after nine years.Why is anyone’s guess, but the tide of public opinion in Ireland was changing and Doyle was not immune to those changes.One other significant event happened in 1919. He married local girl, Charlotte Kennedy, in November 1919 and the couple lived at 18 Mary Street.Changed loyaltiesIn June 1920 the famous photograph was taken of him at a garden party in Buckingham Palace for Victoria Cross recipients. One of the many paradoxical things about Doyle is that he never hesitated to visit London in a British uniform even while he was in the IRA.In October 1920 he took up arms against Britain when he joined the IRA in East Clare acting as an intelligence officer.A month later he was back in London representing the Royal Munster Fusiliers at the unveiling of the Cenotaph in Whitehall.Afterwards he joined the National Army during the Civil War where he was shot in the hand by former colleagues in the IRA.He remained on in the Free State Army after the Civil War and served with the 2nd and 20th Infantry Battalions and the school of instruction.In November 1929, Doyle attended a dinner for VC recipients at the House of Lords and in 1937 he was awarded a Coronation Medal.Would Doyle have been invited to these events if the British knew of his Republican past?In 1937, Doyle applied to be compassionately discharged from the Irish Defence Forces as he had been offered a job in Guinness, a company particularly well disposed to Irishmen who had served in the first World War.His wife was sick at the time. For such a brave man physically, his fears over his family’s health and financial stability are all over his correspondence with the Department of Defence.“I have been very badly treated. Surely I deserve at least the same treatment as other ex British soldiers who served the cause in 1920 and 1921?” he wrote.Privileges such as early discharge were afforded to those who could prove service in the IRA prior to the truce of July 1921. In order to qualify for early discharge, Doyle put together a list of testimonials from those he served with in the IRA.One from Patrick McMahon stated that Doyle “worked and done everything possible for the IRA during the years 19201921”.Complicated historyAccording to historian Stephen O’Connor, 226 members of the British forces served in the IRA during the War of Independence. More significantly, O’Connor estimates, at least 24 had senior positions and seven commanded brigades.He concluded: “Ex-servicemen had a disproportionate impact on the IRA’s campaign in comparison to their actual numbers in the movement.”The Irish Army was reluctant to let him go. Men of Doyle’s experience were exceptionally rare and he proved to be a very good Vickers machine gun and rifle instructor.Doyle eventually succeeded in getting employment in Guinness while staying on the reserve. He finally left the Irish Army on January 25th 1939.He died from polio on November 20th, 1946 at St Patrick’s Dun hospital in Dublin. Remarkably, his three daughters, Bridget, who is 98, Charlotte, who lives in the United States and Mary, who lives in Dublin, are still alive.But what about the puzzle of his gravestone? The fact that he did not have an official Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone was not a deliberate snub by the British Government.Such headstones were only awarded to those who died in combat or as a result of illnesses or wounds in war-time situations. Doyle would not have qualified on that criteria.Not everybody had the means at the time to afford a burial and it’s possible the Old Comrade’s Association stepped in to pay for it.The perplexing issue adds to an already complicated story. Doyle reminds us that there was nothing simple about Irish identity or allegiances 100 years ago."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4158046.1580514054!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 irish voters want change but cannot decide what type research shows","story":"Ipsos MRBI and the  have run focus groups leading up to the last weekend of the general election to research the desire for political change with the electorate.  \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald and deputy leader Michelle O’Neil: some voters are attracted to party’s message of radical change, but others are nervous about some promises. Photograph:  Brian LawlessPA WireUndecided voters are overwhelmingly in favour of change in next week’s general election, focus group research suggests, but many are struggling to decide which party represents the type of change they want to see.The findings suggest Fine Gael faces an uphill battle to stage a comeback in the final week of the campaign, though senior party figures remain confident that a focus on the economy and Brexit will regain ground for the party before voters go to the polls next Saturday.The research, conducted by Ipsos MRBI for The , finds that some voters are attracted to Sinn Féin’s message of radical change, but others are nervous about some of the party’s promises. Other voters are concerned about endangering the economic progress of recent years, despite a widespread sense that Leo Varadkar’s government is out of touch and has failed to deal with issues such as health and housing.The focus groups were conducted in Dublin and Mullingar last week among specially selected voters who are undecided or open to changing their voting intention. They are not intended as statistically representative of the electorate, or to provide data that can be extrapolated. Instead, they indicate attitudes among typical voters on a range of topics.Dissatisfaction with governmentThe findings bear out and explain poll findings that identify dissatisfaction with the current government, and suggest that a comeback for Fine Gael will be a challenge.Voters identified strongly with Sinn Féin’s message of change, and the performance of Mary Lou McDonald was cited as a positive in many of the discussions. Fine Gael figures said the campaign had now entered the final and decisive phase which they said would be focused on the issues of trust, the economy and how to form a government after the election.It is claimed that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was always prepared for a tough opening to the campaign, as happened when the opening stages were dominated by issues such as health and housing, where Fine Gael is weakest. Senior party sources said they intended to press Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin on exactly how he will form a government since he has ruled out coalition with Sinn Féin and Fine Gael. Coalition ruled outMr Martin has repeatedly ruled out entering government with Ms McDonald but Fine Gael sources say the party intends to pressure him on the wider issue of government formation with an emphasis on Sinn Féin.“That is how Micheál gets his government,” said one source. “What else has he got?”Those in Fianna Fáil say their strategy will not change as polling day approaches. Mr Martin said he would not “trust” Mr Varadkar not to enter into a coalition deal with Sinn Féin.Those campaigning across all parties and Independents say the rise in support for Sinn Féin in opinion polls is being reflected on the ground.Ms McDonald on Friday said a poll on Irish unity was an “absolute necessity” for Sinn Féin as a result of Brexit.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4157978.1580501988!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"on the canvass sinn f%C3%A9in confident it can retain two seats in louth","story":"With Gerry Adams stepping down as a TD, Sinn Féin face an uphill battle to retain their two seats in the Louth Constituency.

He is wearing a fracture boot. Later, as a constituent and diehard fan rushes out from her house to give Adams a hug, Adams explains he went over on his foot at home.Tagging along with the former Sinn Féin president is the more nimble Ruairí Ó Murchú, a 41-year-old county councillor, who acknowledges the pressure of trying to retain the seat being vacated by this veteran of Irish politics: nobody wants to be the guy who loses Gerry Adams’s seat. Ó Murchú is confident that it was not just the personal vote for a high-profile political figure that elected both Adams and his Sinn Féin running mate Imelda Munster in 2016.The Dundalk councillor came third in last year’s local elections but is confident that “with a good ground game” the party can return two TDs in the election. Hard askÓ Murchú observes, in a nod to the party’s recent polling figures, that the ground is “somewhat better”.“We knew it would be a hard ask, particularly not having Gerry Adams running, and we did have a sobering local election. The results we are getting on the doors – we think we are in a really good place and that we can do this,” says Ó Murchú , a councillor since 2017.The party has poured a lot of effort into this county on the edge of the Border where support for Sinn Féin and Irish unity has been solid for years.The five-seater constituency is a bellwether for the election. Louth is said to have a seat each for Sinn Féin (either Ó Murchú or Munster), Fianna Fáil (undoubtedly, Declan Breathnach TD) and Fine Gael (probably Fergus O’Dowd TD). The final two seats will be a battle between the three parties seeking a second seat and a group of three others: former Labour TD Ged Nash, the Green Party’s long-time contender Mark Dearey and Peter Fitzpatrick, who is standing as an Independent this time around.Fitzpatrick is the unknown quantity the former Louth Gaelic football manager won a seat in 2016 for Fine Gael but left the party in 2018 over its pro-repeal stance in the abortion referendum and his frustrations over life on the backbenches. It is not clear whether as a celebrity candidate with a strong local profile he will take votes from Fine Gael by presenting himself as an ousted rebel, thereby tapping some of the clear anti-government sentiment, or whether he will struggle.Adams is certain of his own party’s chances of retaining two seats in the county.“I would like to think that it is a constituency we have republicanised. On the day if we get our vote out, we will be grand,” he said.If the reaction on the doorsteps of Cox’s Demesne – Dundalk’s first large council estate and a solidly Sinn Féin stronghold – is repeated elsewhere in the county, two TDs is definitely doable.Ó Murchú talks about Adams’s rock-star status and this is clear to see from the greetings he receives as limps about on Thursday afternoon. Asked what rocker his mentor most resembles, Ó Murchú joshes with Adams: “People have been talking about the Bee Gees lately but I am not sure he is too receptive to that jibe.”Republican dogThe only hostile reception for Sinn Féin around this estate comes from a dog named Saoirse who goes for a canvasser on a path to a front door, prompting a hard dash from freedom.“That’s the first dog called Saoirse that has ever attacked a republican, I think,” he says. “He must not be a republican dog he must be pretending to be a republican, a Fianna Fáil dog,” jokes John Connolly, a former IRA blanket man who now works for peace and his community. On the doorsteps, the party’s workers hear little of support for Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. One man tells Adams he is adamant he won’t vote for “Leo Martin”. The constituent says that he is going to give his number two to Fitzpatrick, pointing to the Clann na Gael Gaelic club across the road from the estate, the sitting TD’s own club.The appetite around here is a clear desire for change and to see Sinn Féin in government. One of the canvassers out with Ó Murchú and Adams, Paddy Agnew, a former IRA member who was elected TD in this constituency during the 1981 hunger strikes, cannot understand the refusal of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael to countenance coalition government with Sinn Féin.“There is peace everywhere. The war is over,” he said. “What do you have to do? Ian Paisley wouldn’t be doing what they are doing. They need to get on with it.” The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020matt cartoon february 1","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Broadcasters accused of bias against Brexit Day celebrationsComment: It\u0026#39s time to end the Left-wing stranglehold on public bodiesPalestinians end security coordination with Israel in protest at Trump planComment: Brexit was a vote of self-confidence.

There is a feeling in the sector that we are bashed a lot.”He said that Labour’s recent anti-private school stance was not a concern in itself, but it highlighted the fact that “we no longer have the support of the Tories in the way that maybe 20 years ago it was assumed”.“We are often misunderstood by politicians and we need to explain the story. We do an awful lot as well as running our own schools,” Mr Cairns added.  Last year, the Department for Education published new guidance on ways in which fee-paying schools should collaborate with their neighbouring state schools. Independent schools could allow state educated pupils to join their classes in subjects such as languages and Classics, it suggests. Private schools could also share facilities such as science laboratories with nearby state schools, it adds, while teachers from fee-paying institutions could share lesson plans and resources.  Three quarters of independent schools in England are registered as charities, meaning they must demonstrate that they provide “public benefit” to a reasonably wide section of the public, rather than to a narrow group of wealthy iniduals.Traditionally this has been done by offering bursaries and fee discounts to children from disadvantaged families.However, many private schools now enter into partnerships with local state schools, which can include sharing teachers in specialist subjects or opening up their sports facilities.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"treasure hunter proves experts wrong saxon coin rewrites history","story":"A treasure hunter who found a 1,300-year-old coin will have history books rewritten after spending three years proving it was genuine.Experts and scholars dismissed the silver penny Andy Hall unearthed in a muddy field as it featured the head of a virtually-unknown Saxon king.And the date it was hammered - 826AD - would also have meant the history books on Britain would have to be re-written.But the 55-year-old metal detectorist was determined to prove them wrong.He spent the next three years having his coin examined by other experts and even paid £300 for a metallurgical analysis of it.The scientific study confirmed the coin was 95 per cent silver and \u0027completely consistent with coinage in the period 810-840AD\u0027.The face depicted on the coin is Ludica, the Saxon king of Mercia - which included London - and who reigned for just over a year in 826-827AD.The record books state that London fell to the Wessex King Ecgberht at the Battle of Ellandun in 825AD.But Andy\u0027s coin proves that Mercia still retained London - or Lundenwic as it was then - in 826AD.It did not fall under Ecgberht\u0027s control until after Ludica was killed fighting the East Angles in 827AD.Andy has now offered his coin for sale with London auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb who have given it an estimate of £15,000.Andy said: I have a love for history and numismatics and so wanted the historical importance of this coin recorded and, as the finder, I felt I had a responsibility to do so.The process took just over three years and cost £300 in total.I was over the moon when I first read the analysis results, I re-read them about five times.Even though I was expecting a positive result I felt enormous relief. I knew I had dug it up, but there is always the thought that it may have been a contemporary forgery or a 19th century fantasy piece.I felt that at last my patience and determination over the last three years had paid off, even though it seemed impossible at times.It\u0027s very satisfying to have made a very tiny contribution to our knowledge of the period.Andy found the penny during a one-off visit to farmland at Coombe Bisset, Wilts, in January 2016.It was buried up to four inches deep in the mud.Andy said: I saw that it was a Saxon silver penny and when I got it home I gently washed off the mud with distilled water.I then had to Google Ludica to find out who the monarch was. I then sent photos and details to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge as that is where new discoveries of early medieval coins are registered.When he tried to auction the coin in June 2016 he was told by a leading historian and expert in Anglo-Saxon coins that there was concerns about its authenticity.Andy said: I agreed to take the coin back and approach specialists myself.I organised a meeting at the Fitzwilliam Museum and received a positive reception although the issue was still concern over its authenticity.It took another 18 months for coin to be sent off for analysis where it was verified.Since then an article was written about the new discovery in the British Numismatic Society journal.Nigel Mills, antiquities expert at Dix Noonan Webb, said: Ludica is only mentioned briefly in the Anglo Saxon chronicles, so this coin shows he retained London during his reign.Ludica is first recorded as a military commander in 824AD under the Mercian king Beornwulf.Beornwulf was defeated by the Wessex king Ecgberht in 825AD and it was believed that he then took control of south eastern England.This coin shows that Mercia still retained London in 826AD and that it did not fall under Ecgberhts control until after Ludica was killed in 827AD.Nigel Mills, the coin experts at Dix Noonan Webb, said the King Ludica coin could have been lost forever had Mr Hall not been so determined to prove it was genuine.He said: The view from eminent experts at the time was \u0027this coin cannot exist because Mercia did not have London in 826AD and therefore the coin must be a fabrication.\u0027The problem when something as new and radically different as this coin comes to the market is that one naturally questions its authenticity and it comes down to the person who found it to prove it is genuine.Andy was given the coin back and he had to go to several museums to find out where he could have it tested.When the result came back that it was irrefutably right, those same experts had to hold up their hands and acknowledge it.This coin was a piece of propaganda at the time. Usually these coins would have the name on the moneyer on the reverse but this unique example has the city of London on it.What it is telling is that although Wessex was expanding, London was still ruled by King Ludica of Mercia. It is proclaiming that he still retained London.The coin has the bust of Ludica facing right with the legend LUDICA REX MER while the reverse features the inscription LUNDONIACIVIT in three lines.Andy will share the proceeds of the sale with the owner of the land the coin was found on.It is being sold on March 10.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus latest university york student one britains first","story":"One of the first two people to test positive for coronavirus in the UK is a student at the University of York.The pair - two members of the same family - are being treated at a specialist unit in Newcastle.They had checked in to the Staycity apartment-hotel in York on Wednesday and were taken to hospital that evening.Health chiefs confirmed on Friday that they had tested positive for the virus - which has killed 259 people in China.In a statement on Saturday a spokesman for the university said the risk of the infection being passed on to other people on campus is low.He said: We understand this development will cause concern and anxiety among our students, staff, and the wider community.PHE (Public Health England) has advised us that the risk of infection being passed to others on campus is low.Current information from PHE suggests that the student did not come into contact with anybody on campus whilst they had symptoms, but investigations are ongoing to fully establish this.Our immediate concerns are for the affected student and family, along with the health and continued wellbeing of our staff, students and visitors.The hotel firm has said the apartment involved has been thoroughly disinfected and PHE has been providing support.The two patients are being treated by Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in its specialist Airborne High Consequences Infectious Disease Centre (HCID).Professor Sharon Peacock said PHE is contacting people who had close contact - defined as being within two metres of the infected person for 15 minutes - with the pair.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tv broke inside no 10 hailed new dawn brexit","story":"It wasn\u0027t the most auspicious start to what the Prime Minister has hailed as the “dawn of a new era”.As the clock prepared to strike 11pm, signalling the moment Britain left the European Union, the television inside No. 10 broke down.Outside those who had longed for this moment partied, while those who had dreaded it held wakes.But the interruption of the live feed left those attending Boris Johnson’s own Brexit party without pictures of the celebrations around the country, or of the countdown clock that was at that moment being beamed onto the front of Downing St (see picture below).A broken TV wasn’t going to deter Mr Johnson and those he had invited to celebrate the culmination of years of campaigning to leave the EU.Grabbing a small gong the Prime Minister stepped forward and rang in the historic moment himself.“There are very few moments in our lives that really can be called an historic turning point, and this is it,” he told his guests, who included Health Secretary Matt Hancock, Trade Secretary Liz Truss and the Chancellor, Sajid Javid.This is not the end, as some people would say. It\u0027s not even the beginning of the end. It\u0027s not the half of the middle. This is the end of the beginning.This is the start of something fantastic and different. And this is our chance to do something different and fantastic with our wonderful country.More than one person was in tears, as the significance of what they had achieved began to sink in.Mr Johnson turned to thank Dominic Cummings, his senior advisor and architect of the campaign to leave the EU, saying: It was he, I seem to remember, who came up with the famous phrase that we should ‘take back control’.It was also Dom that came up with the other three word epigram, that the policy of the government should be to get Brexit done.And I want you to remember that you were here tonight, after 11 oclock, when finally, we got Brexit done.Mr Cummings, a man revered as a political genius by many and reviled by plenty more, appeared overcome by the emotion of the moment.Rubbing his face he said simply: Lots of people in this room know what happened. Thank you.Carrie Symonds, the Prime Minister’s girlfriend, tweeted a photograph of their dog Dilyn wearing a union flag coat.As befitted the moment their guests, who ranged from Cabinet ministers, to Brexit negotiators and Leave campaigners, enjoyed a menu of British party fare, including Shropshire blue cheese, fillet of lamb on toast, mushroom tarts, crab cake and beef inside mini Yorkshire puddings with horseradish.And to toast the occasion ? English sparkling wine rather than Champagne, of course.Outside in the country, meanwhile, parties were being staged to rejoice at the moment Britain exited the European Union after 47 years. Others mourned the arrival of a moment they had fought so bitterly to stop.Mr Johnson, while acknowledging that not everyone in the country - indeed not even all those in the room - had voted Leave, praised those who had.In my view the people of this country are the real heroes of this story,” he said. Because if you think what happened, in 2016 they were given a choice - and they voted very substantially to leave.And I know there are lots of people in this room who didn\u0027t necessarily vote leave, but I don\u0027t care.The people of this country voted to leave despite everything they were told by the CBI and the BBC. But the people of this country in their bravery, in their absolutely brilliant, logical, ination of the truth, they voted to leave in spite of all of the threats of punishment that they heard.Away from Downing Street other parties with key Leave figures were in full swing across London.Jon Moynihan, a Tory donor and former director of Vote Leave, threw open the doors of his house in Chelsea.Waitresses sporting union flag lapel badges passed around glasses of champagne while guests munched on including caviar and roast beef and Yorkshire pudding canapes.Guests included Tory MPs Penny Mordaunt, Adam Holloway, Julian Lewis, Greg Hands, Mark Francois, Sir Nigel Evans and Sir Graham Brady as well as the economist Gerard Lyons and banker Sir Henry Angest.At just after 11pm, as Britain formally left the European Union, Elaine Page, the singer and actress, took a microphone and sang the final verse from Memory, the song she made famous in the musical Cats! Look a new day has begun.Mr Moynihan treated the guests to six bottles of Brexit Beer as they left, stamped with the date of Britain\u0027s exit 31 Jan 2020, and described as a brew that is like the British character, well-balanced and full-flavoured, best enjoyed after a phew.”Some of the guests then headed to a party thrown by former Ukip and current Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage at the Cavalry and Guards Club, on Piccadilly.A smattering of Tory MPs including Sir Nigel Evans, former Brexit secretary David Davis, and Mark Francois were spotted among the 400 guests.Comedian Jim Davidson told the boisterous crowd that Brexit had caused some upset in his household with his wife because I am a Leaver and she was a Remainer -  I get up and leave the house to go work in the morning and she remains in bed all day.Just as guests were gathering at Mr Moynihan\u0027s house another group, including Home secretary Priti Patel, were partying at Robin Birley\u0027s private members\u0027 club 5 Hertford Street a few miles away in Mayfair.Churchill\u0027s biographer Andrew Roberts gave one what one guest describe as the best speech they had ever heard about Brexit and its possible positive impact on Britain\u0027s fortunes.The Bow Group hosted an event at London’s County Hall to celebrate the work of the 1992 Maastricht rebels for their role in paving the way for Britain’s departure from the EU.Speeches were given by those involved in rebellion, including Sir John Redwood MP, John Whittingdale MP, Nirj Deva, and Bow Group Chairman Ben Harris-Quinney.Some guests processed to Parliament Square for the stroke of 11, while others watched from across the Thames as the sound of the bongs and God Save the Queen drifted over the water.There were similar enthusiastic scenes around the country, with Brexit parties as far apart as Leeds, Boston and Bristol.In Derby’s bar free fizz flowed, a buffet of British classics was served and 80s disco classics sent the dancefloor spinning.Rob Evans, 29, from Stoke, arrived wearing a Boris Johnson mask to mark the occasion. I\u0027m delighted that it\u0027s done, he said, clutching a pint and repeatedly muttering Brexit means Brexit.As the clock struck 11pm, friends jumped up and down in each other\u0027s arms, couples embraced and some dabbed tears from their eyes.The 200-strong crowd sang Jerusalem with gusto, preceded by a recording of Brian May’s electric guitar version of God Save The Queen, and gleefully changed the words to Belinda Carlisle\u0027s famous track to Oh Brexit is a place on earth.Back in London, while Mr Johnson banged his gong the evening in Parliament Square - where thousands gathered to celebrate - belonged to Mr Farage.When the former member of the European Parliament he had spent so long campaigning to leave arrived, it was to the sort of rapturous welcome reserved for national heroes and freedom fighters. His supporters, of course, regard him as both.He took to the stage shortly before the Leave deadline, to the strains of The Final Countdown, and the crowd went crazy, chanting his name over and over.“For the first time in the history of Great Britain the people have beaten the establishment!” he cried to earsplitting roars of approval. “The war is over. We. Have. Won.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/31/15/infact-norway-electric-car.jpg","title":"electric cars facts hybrid charging battery power energy pros cons","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Don’t some electric cars run on hydrogen?How far will one go on a charge?What are the advantages of an electric car?What are the disadvantages?Don’t they take ages to charge?Will they get easier to charge and go further in future?What about hybrids?Aren’t electric cars all a bit oddball?On my electric car odyssey, I thought I ought to start by sharing some basics with you, in Q\u0026ampA form. I mean, very basic. I’ve driven a fair few in my time – and this year will be sampling many more. This is a bit of what I’ve learned, imperfectly, thus far.\u0026nbspIt is not, for these purposes, a “hybrid”, like the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbspor any other vehicle that also has an internal combustion engine on board (with one of two very particular exceptions).\u0026nbspAn electric car is a pure thing – it runs completely and solely on its batteries. When they run out, you stop moving.\u0026nbspI like to think of it as a cross between a washing machine, a laptop and,\u0026nbsperm, a car. So, your car is driven entirely by electric power – powerful lithium-ion batteries (like in your laptop) sending electricity to an electric motor (like your washing machine) which drives the road wheels (like on your motor car).\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, London210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, LondonThe electricity stored in the batteries mostly comes from being plugged into the mains (there are various charging options, most commonly a fast charger attached to the side of your home, if you have the space). Some will be regenerated from the car itself, saving power otherwise wasted when braking, for example.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp2 Don’t some electric cars run on hydrogen?Yes, but they are not much more than prototypes, with only a handful of filling stations currently. Critics say using a hydrogen fuel cell to generate the electricity for the batteries simply adds an additional stage of energy accumulation and the manufacture of the hydrogen could be problematic, if it requires a disproportionate amount of non-renewable electricity.\u0026nbsp3 How far will one go on a charge?Well, that depends, but you can count on a modern mainstream electric car these days to bae able to take you 200 to 250 miles (conservatively) on a single charge – a\u0026nbspKia\u0026nbspe-Niro, say, or Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric. In the right hands, 300 miles might be possible. This, by the way is two or three times the usual range you’d experience a few years ago.\u0026nbspFeeling the spark: Drivers learning to love electric carsThe most advanced models, such as the famous Tesla range, will go on and on for near enough 400 miles. Some of the smaller more urban-oriented models, such as the new electric Smart cars will be good for about 100 miles.\u0026nbspThe rest is down to how you drive and when. Winter means the batteries tend to run down faster and you’ll likely get a shorter range.\u0026nbspIf you drive hard and fast you’ll use up more energy than otherwise, just like in a petrol or diesel car. Over along time the ability of the batteries to take and store a charge will deteriorate (just like your smartphone or laptop).Yes. To buy or lease you’re looking at a premium of some thousands of pounds. So, let’s take an example, the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona, a compact\u0026nbspSUV.\u0026nbsp With a conventional petrol engine you can pick one up at a list price of £17,505. For the hybrid version (petrol plus electric power generated on-board) you’ll need to fork out £22,495. For the\u0026nbspBEV\u0026nbspHyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric, the price jumps to £35,100, or £32,600 when you take into account the government grant for electric cars of up to £3,500. \u0026nbspAgainst the usually higher purchase price or monthly PCP or lease fee you need to balance the savings you make compared t petrol or diesel: far cheaper fuel spending on your electricity tariff) lower running costs (fewer moving mechanical parts and consumables eg exhaust pipe, alternator, engine) and a range of lower taxes and congest and parking charges. Electric cars are exempt from road tax, carry lower benefit-in-kind tax liabilities for commercial users, usually form congestion charges and city bans, and can enjoy cheaper parking. There’s also a government subsidy of up to £500 for a home charger.\u0026nbspWhy have electric cars failed to spark with consumers? Has Tesla hastened the death of Britain’s electric car revolution?Grant Shapps’ plan for electric cars will make China a motoring giantWhether this makes financial sense really depends your pattern of car usage – the number of miles you do a year, and the type of journeys. With a lot of medium range commuting for example (say 60 miles a day) an electric car could pay for itself within a few years for sustained long-distance travelling then a diesel might make more sense.5 What are the advantages of an electric car?Apart from the financial ones it is of course far better for the environment. There are many debates about, say, the cost (in environmental terms) of mining rare minerals for the batteries, or transporting them vast distances to factories, or the energy used in making them. Also obviously an electric car that runs on electricity generated from soar power is better than one where the electricity happens to be generated by burning coal (ins or far as anyone can know this when they plug in).\u0026nbspHowever a reasonable assumption is that all electric cars are greener than any internal combustion engined equivalent, and that any public transport (rail or bus) is usually greener than any private alternative.Don’t forget that electric cars are very refined – being almost silent at any speed, and the acceleration form rest is startlingly fast, though they tend to run out of puff as they approach their top speeds. In other words they can be good to drive and to be driven in.6 What are the disadvantages?Surprisingly few, though it does depend on your circumstances. If you live in a flat or a terraced house, charging from home is obviously impossible or difficult, and the ease of use of an electric vehicle is much reduced. If you imagine that you’ll have to do journeys of more than 400 miles without warning, then an internal combustion engine is a surer way of getting wherever it is you might conceivably wish to go – though you’d need to take a break anyway.\u0026nbspIt’s fair to add that some of the public charging infrastructure leaves a bit to be desired – it could usefully be much bigger, more reliable and easier to use.And of course you do need to balance the financial sums against the clear practical and environmental plusses of being a green driver.\u0026nbsp7 Don’t they take ages to charge?Yes and no. The Tesla is an exception, in many ways, because it has a dedicated network of ultra-fast chargers, as well as being chargeable at home.\u0026nbspMost owners of electric cars have to rely on charging at home – but don’t\u0026nbsp have much trouble charging because they most likely have a home charging point, which does mean off-street parking for the moment. If you take a mainstream option like the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectricity home, using a regular\u0026nbsp7kW\u0026nbspcharging point via its own cable a near-full zero to 80 per cent charge takes around 9 hours.A similar charge with a rapid charger (such as you’d fine at, say, motorway services)\u0026nbsptakes around an hour and a quarter. 75 minutes.\u0026nbspIn an emergency, you can also use a domestic three-pin charging lead, plugged into the mains at home like you’d plug in a kettle. However you’d looking at about 24 hours for a full charge – because the batteries are so big and the trickle form the domestic system so modest.\u0026nbsp8 Will they get easier to charge and go further in future?Yes. Much of the progress in the usefulness of the electric car is coming from improvements in battery “density” – the amount of useful power that can be stored in a an ever-more compact way.The battery pack is usually stored lower in the car, under the floor or the seats, and this can help with keeping the car stable (lower centre of gravity). Given that these units can grow very hot and need ventilation or water cooling for example, and have to be protected from water ingress (if fording a stream say, or just in a heavy downpour) , the progress in engineering in this field is truly impressive.\u0026nbspHowever, eventually the rate of improvement in range and efficiency will slow, and that might well mark an optimal moment to make a purchase or take on an electric car lease. But we cannot know when this will happen.9 What about hybrids?Well, what about hybrids? They are not electric cars. This is because they are, as the name implies, hybrids – a cross between an electric car and a traditional one powered by a petrol or diesel engine. Thus well-known hybrid models such as the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbsphave an internal combustion engine on board, as well as an electric motor and some batteries to boost performance and economy.\u0026nbspIn a hybrid the electric power is “self-generated”, which is to say that it comes from the engine regenerating and recycling power that might otherwise be wasted. So for example some of the power usually lost in heavy braking is instead sent back via the electric motor working “backwards” to the batteries, where it is stored for later use.\u0026nbspI drove 300 miles in an electric car and here’s what happenedMost hybrids pair an electric and a petrol engine because the two units tend to complement each other in use diesel-electric hybrids are rarer. “Mild” hybrids are just that – they have only a small ethic motor and minimal battery storage just to give a slight edge to reduce emissions and improve economy. The green advantage is quite marginal.\u0026nbspPlug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have the additional option of charging from the mains, as with an electric car, but it is not necessary to do so.\u0026nbspThe drawback with the hybrid technology is the constant trade-offs that have to made between the energy saved through the battery-electric motor system, set against the additional weight of them, which of course tends to raise fuel consumption. Clever software can minimise these trade-offs to more acceptable levels, but they will always be there, as compared to a\u0026nbspBEV. Hybrids, indeed, in their complexity and weight, can represent the e worst of both worlds.\u0026nbsp10 Aren’t electric cars all a bit oddball?They have been, yes, but the next few months year will see the launch of some very well-known models with full-electric versions.\u0026nbsp These will include: the Vauxhall\u0026nbspCorsa-e Peugeot 208 electric Volvo\u0026nbspXC40\u0026nbspRecharge and the Mini electric. They join an already quiet impressive variety of electric cars on sale or soon to go on sale.From the tiny\u0026nbspSkoda\u0026nbspCiti GOe-iV\u0026nbspand Smart EQ through the Renault Zoe to the Nissan leaf to MG ZS and the Jaguar\u0026nbspiPace\u0026nbspthere are already options to match your tastes and budget. And there is also a small market in used models such as the Renault\u0026nbspFluence, Mitsubishi\u0026nbspIMEV, Vauxhall\u0026nbspAmpera\u0026nbspor first generation Nissan Leaf that might also suit.These cars will tend to have shorter ranges, though, while older Renaults may still have their batteries on monthly lease from the company. As always – do your own research, but you can approach an electric car with more positivity than ever before.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s not just because the contestants look the same each year, or because their conversations are dull as dishwater. It’s about what they wear.\u0026nbspEvery year, the same cohort of aspiring Instagram influencers bounds into that sun-soaked villa claiming to be “looking for love” when in fact, the only thing they’re looking for is a contract with Boohoo. Or Missguided. Or Nasty Gal. Or any other fast fashion brand that will pay them oodles of money to wear their clothes and sit in on a design meeting or two.\u0026nbspSince the ITV2 programme started in its current iteration, its contestants have gone on to land six-figure deals with fast fashion labels. Last season alone, female stars including Molly-Mae Hague, Maura Higgins and Amber Gill all landed up lucrative partnerships with Pretty Little Thing, Boohoo and MissPap, respectively – Gill’s is rumoured to be worth £1m. The men fared well\u0026nbsptoo\u0026nbsp– Ovie Soko got a deal with ASOS while Tommy Fury was snapped up by Boohoo Man. They follow in the footsteps of former contestants like Kem Cetinay, Amber Davies and Olivia Buckland, who have also gone on to partner with fast fashion brands since leaving the show.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCreated with Sketch.Winter Love Island 2020: Meet the 12 contestants Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Shaugna is a democratic services officer from London.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reading was in line with analysts’ forecasts that it would hit the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.New export orders slipped back after rising for the first time in over a year in December. However, the survey was conducted before January 20, the day the world receiving reported numbers of cases of the virus. “So this will be seen as largely meaningless,” said Jim Reid, global head of credit research at Deutsche Bank.There have been 213 confirmed deaths (up from 170 on Thursday) while the number of confirmed cases stands at 9,692 (up from 7,783). The number of confirmed cases has now topped the official recordings of 8,096 cases in the SARS epidemic.Deutsche’s China economists believe the turning point is not far away, and that assuming the measures taken are effective at containing the outbreak, the peak of new cases outside Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — will likely happen at some point next week.There has been growing concern in financial markets that Beijing may have sought to conceal the start and full extent to the virus to contain the risk of panic.Georgieva said the world was facing more unpredictability whether from pandemics, climate shocks and geopolitical tensions. “Preparedness, prevention and early action have to be in the bloodstream of policy makers,” she said.According to research by ING bank, SARS knocked 1.0 per cent off Chinese GDP back in 2003, but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast.It said that a 1 per cent fall in Chinese growth would mainly hit the Asia-Pacific region with countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia losing 0.3 percentage points. The impact on the UK would be around just 0.02 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.On Thursday, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold after signals of a pick-up. The minutes of its meeting showed that it expects the UK House Price Index to have risen quite strongly in both the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of this year.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the figures were another sign that the UK housing market has “at least temporarily stepped up a gear”.“Mortgage approvals in December were\u0026nbsphighly likely\u0026nbspsignificantly lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainties among housing market participants following the decisive general election result,” he said.Why the calm over interest rates might not lastFigures from the bank on Friday also showed growth in consumer credit, rising\u0026nbspby £1.2bn, while credit card borrowing increased\u0026nbspby the most since February, up by £412m.Household spending has helped to drive Britain’s economy over the past few years, helped by record levels of employment and a recovery in wage growth,\u0026nbspbut there were signs of a slowdown in spending in late 2019.The bank’s data also showed that December saw the biggest increase on record in net purchases of British government bonds by foreign investors –\u0026nbspan increase of £28.6bn. The records date back to 1982.Meanwhile, it emerged that the bank will be repaid €58m (£49m) by the European Central Bank after the UK leaves the European Union. Brexit will mean that the Bank of England pulls out of the European System of Central Banks.The bank holds 14.3 per cent of the European Central Bank’s subscribed capital, of which 3.75 per cent –\u0026nbspequivalent to €58m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspis paid up. The capital will be reallocated between the other EU central banks.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Conservative Party won with an overall majorityA dog outside a polling station during the general election in NorthumberlandOne poster on the Debt Camel advice website said their payment was an “absolute joke”, adding that they had paid more in interest on\u0026nbspone of their dozens of loans than they would receive in redress. Another wrote: “My claim was £986. I’m getting about £43. It’s an absolute disgrace.”However, some customers were more positive about the payouts. Sam\u0026nbspWindle, who took out loans with\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspseveral years ago, said that although 4.3 per cent was less than he had hoped for, it was better than nothing.His redress amount was initially £5,200 before being reduced to £2,700, of which he received just £121. However, like many other\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspcustomers, he was not aware that he was due compensation until the administrators contacted him.Mr Windle, who has now cleared all of his debts, was at one point paying off around £300 interest to\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspon each of seven payday loans. “It was a vicious cycle really. I can honestly say the day I paid it all off was the happiest day of my life.”He added: “The only frustrating about the compensation\u0026nbspis that it was due to be paid in January bit that’s been put back to some point in the next four weeks. The communication from the administrators has been pretty poor really.”Sara Williams, a personal finance expert who runs the Debt Camel website, said: “People were told last year by the Wonga administrators what their compensation amount had been calculated at and they were warned their payout would be ‘significantly less’.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the average compensation of about £1000, they will get only £43.\u0026nbsp“Some people, remembering the stress the Wonga loans had caused them,\u0026nbsphave described this as an insult and not proper compensation at all.”Wonga had faced a barrage of criticism over the high interest it charged on loans and was accused of targeting those who were most vulnerable.In 2014, the firm wrote off £220m worth of debt belonging to 330,000 customers after admitting making loans to people who could not afford to repay them.Administrators had received 389,621 eligible claims from those said to have been sold unaffordable loans as of August 2019, according to documents filed with Companies House.Prior to its collapse in August 2018, Wonga blamed its difficulties on a “significant” increase in people making claims in relation to historic loans.

The reading was in line with analysts’ forecasts that it would hit the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.New export orders slipped back after rising for the first time in over a year in December. However, the survey was conducted before January 20, the day the world receiving reported numbers of cases of the virus. “So this will be seen as largely meaningless,” said Jim Reid, global head of credit research at Deutsche Bank.There have been 213 confirmed deaths (up from 170 on Thursday) while the number of confirmed cases stands at 9,692 (up from 7,783). The number of confirmed cases has now topped the official recordings of 8,096 cases in the SARS epidemic.Deutsche’s China economists believe the turning point is not far away, and that assuming the measures taken are effective at containing the outbreak, the peak of new cases outside Hubei province — where Wuhan is located — will likely happen at some point next week.There has been growing concern in financial markets that Beijing may have sought to conceal the start and full extent to the virus to contain the risk of panic.Georgieva said the world was facing more unpredictability whether from pandemics, climate shocks and geopolitical tensions. “Preparedness, prevention and early action have to be in the bloodstream of policy makers,” she said.According to research by ING bank, SARS knocked 1.0 per cent off Chinese GDP back in 2003, but the huge uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus makes the macro impact very difficult to forecast.It said that a 1 per cent fall in Chinese growth would mainly hit the Asia-Pacific region with countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia losing 0.3 percentage points. The impact on the UK would be around just 0.02 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And while his performance in that film was certainly worthy of the accolade, you could argue the actor deserved nominations just as much for Nightcrawler, Nocturnal Naimals, Stronger, Prisoners, Enemy, and Donnie Darko. Pam Grier was not only robbed of an Oscar for Quentin Tarantino’s classic thriller Jackie Brown, she was robbed of a nomination full stop. Conversely, her co-star Robert Forster picked up a Supporting Actor nomination. Certainly, an oversight from the Academy.Jim Carrey has been nominated for more Grammy Awards than Oscars, having picked up a nomination for Best Spoken Word Album for Children in 2006 for A Series of Unfortunate Events. The academy, sadly, has never given Carrey a fair chance, despite winning over the world in the likes of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Man on the Moon and The Truman Show.Chastain has the aura of an Oscar winner. Somewhere down the line, surely one her roles won her an Oscar? Yet, despite nominations for The Help and Zero Dark, plus stand-out leading roles in films such as Molly’s Game, the actor still does not have a statuette.Of James Dean’s three credited film roles, two were nominated for Oscars – Giant and East of Eden (Rebel Without a Cause was not nominated). Only one of his films, Eden, was released before his tragic passing in 1955.The Academy members should hang their heads in shame for never nominating John Goodman, one of the finest ever character actors, for an award. Considering his brilliant performances in Raising Arizona (1987), Barton Fink (1991), The Big Lebowski (1998), O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) – and those are just his collaborations with the Coen Brothers – he must be wondering what he has to do to be acknowledged by the Academy. Salma Hayek’s career highlight, Frida, came within inches of bringing her an Oscar. Yet, it was not to be – the actor was beaten by Nicole Kidman in The Hours, and Hayak has since been ignored by the Academy.Michelle Pfeiffer was one of the most popular actors working in the 1980s and 1990s, nabbing Oscar nominations for Dangerous Liaisons (1988), The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989) and Love Field (1992). However, as the ceremonies came and went, no victory followed.That Rosario Dawson has become more associated with Superheroes than awards is a tragedy. Her roles in Rent, 25th Hour and Sin City have won her praise from critics and fans alike, but there’s still not an Oscar or Golden Globe mention on her IMDB page.You\u0027d think that Angela Lansbury, having won five Tony Awards and six Golden Globes, would have at least one Oscar at home. Not so. Despite her three nominations – for Gaslight (1944), The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945) and The Manchurian Candidate (1962) – the Dame is yet to triumph at the Academy Awards. Oscar Isaac, his many fans argue, was robbed of an Oscar nomination for Inside Llewyn Davis. The critically acclaimed Coen brothers film failed to make the Best Picture cut, and poor Isaac, who played the eponymous struggling folk singer to perfection, was left without a nod. He was also overlooked for Ex Machina and A Most Violent Year.The Princess Bride, Forrest Gump, Moneyball: Robin Wright has consistently left critics and audiences impressed. And while no Oscars have followed, her work on the TV series House of Card has earned her seven primetime Emmy award nominations.Bradley Cooper’s directorial debut, A Star is Born, had won acclaim across the board and looked set for Oscars glory (with a Best Actor award almost within grasp). However, Rami Malek stole victory away from him at the last moment. Perhaps the best run of his career came between 2013 and 2015, when he was nominated for three consecutive acting Oscars: Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle and American Sniper.You would be forgiven for presuming Joaquin Phoenix has an Oscar statuette somewhere at home. Yet the star of The Master, Walk the Line and Gladiator – all for which he was nominated – has no such award lying around. Instead, Phoenix will have to make do with a Golden Globe, a Grammy (for his work on the Walk the Line soundtrack) and a People’s Choice Award.Angela Bassett has had one of the most prolific careers in Hollywood history, starring in dozens of TV shows and films. Her roles in What\u0027s Love Got to Do with It (1993), Malcolm X (1992) and Music of the Heart (1999) won awards elsewhere – but not with the Academy.Sigourney Weaver on the set of the original Alien film in 1979Despite playing multiple roles that seem like certain Oscar winners, David Oyelowo has never even been nominated for an award. His role as Martin Luther King Jr in 2014’s Selma has gone down as one of the biggest snubs in recent history and was one of many incidents that led to the #OscarsSoWhite movement.One of the most iconic actors of all time, Marilyn Monroe never received an Oscar nomination. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), How to Marry a Millionaire (1953) and Some Like It Hot (1959) may have gone down as classics, but Monroe never stood out enough for the Academy.The Big Lebowski, Fargo, Reservoir Dogs, Miller\u0027s Crossing, Con Air, Armageddon, Big Fish, The Death of Stalin and Barton Fink... just several films Steve Buscemi was not nominated for an Oscar for. In fact, Buscemi has never been nominated for an Academy Award.Three Oscar nominations for Woody Harrelson, and three loses for Woody Harrelson – Larry Flynt in The People vs Larry Flynt (1996), The Messenger (2009) and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017). But, like that widely shared Zombieland GIF, Harrelson will be wiping away the tears with a wedge of dollar bills, his films having made more than $3 billion at the box office worldwide.Mia Farrow may have starred in the classics Rosemary’s Baby, Broadway Danny Rose and The Purple Rose of Cairo, but not a single nomination followed. Surprising for someone who has won three Baftas and a Golden Globe.While many people suspected Idris Elba would score an Oscar nomination for Beasts of No Nation, the Academy’s hatred for Netflix proved too strong (Bafta and the Globes nominated him instead). Even other prime Oscar-bait – Molly’s Game, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, Second Coming – failed to land Elba any nominations. No wonder, perhaps, that the actor has stuck primarily to multi-million-dollar blockbusters.Having had acclaimed roles in American History X, Fight Club and Birdman, Edward Norton will no doubt go down as one of America’s most talented actors. Unfortunately, the actor has no Oscars to show it.By starring in both Lost in Translation and Girl with a Pearl Earring, Scarlett Johansson shot herself slightly in the foot in 2003. For the two roles, she landed double Leading Actress nominations at Bafta (winning for Translation) and two Globes nominations. The Oscars? Not one. And despite standout roles in Lucy, Under the Skin, Match Pint, A Love Song for Bobby Long, she still has never been nominated for an Oscar.Samuel L Jackson is one of the most prolific actors working in Hollywood and has one Oscar nomination – for Pulp Fiction (1995). Considering he’s ranked as the highest all-time box office star, having made over $12 billion worldwide, the Avengers actor’s probably not all that upset.GettySamuel L Jackson poses at a portrait session during day three of the 13th annual Dubai International Film FestivalWith four Oscar nominations under her belt, Michelle Williams somehow still has no statuette placed on her mantelpiece. Her closest call came in 2016, when she starred in Manchester By the Sea, when she was up against the supreme Viola Davis, who went on to win the award for Fences.Few actors can attest to being as hardworking as Annette Bening. Revered for her work onstage, she also won acclaim for Oscar-nominated on-screen roles in The Grifters (1990), American Beauty (1999) and The Kids Are Alright (2010). That she was completely overlooked for 20th Century Women in 2017 was a glaring oversight. Kirk Douglas was a leading man in Hollywood’s Golden Age, his roles in Spartacus, Lust for Life and Champion inspiring a generation of actors after him. Still, the actor never won a competitive Oscar – only an honorary one in 1996, for his 50 years in the creative industry.Irene Dunne – nominated five times – is one of the few recipients of the Kennedy Centre Honours for her service to the performing arts. Yet her performances in Cimarron (1931), Theodora Goes Wild (1936), The Awful Truth (1937), Love Affair (1939) and I Remember Mama (1948) all went unrewarded by the Academy.One of the world’s most accomplished character actors, Arthur Kennedy was best known for his supporting roles in films such as Champion (1949), Trial (1955), Peyton Place (1957) and Some Came Running (1958), all of which won him Oscar nods. And despite a leading actor nomination in 1951 for Lights Out, Kennedy still couldn’t manage a win.One of Britain’s premiere Shakespearean actors, Albert Finney was nominated five times across almost four decades, for Tom Jones (1963), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), The Dresser (1983), Under the Volcano (1984) and Erin Brockovich (2000).Six-time nominee Dame Deborah Kerr famously failed to win for the musical The King and I – losing to Ingrid Bergman in Anastasia. Thankfully, the Academy realised their error years later, awarding Kerr an honorary award and calling her “a dedicated actress whose motion picture career has always stood for perfection, discipline and elegance.Another actor with six nominations and no wins. Even a role in 1950s All About Eve, which would win Best Picture, couldn’t push Thelma Ritter to victory. She went on to be nominated four more times that decade, for The Mating Season (1951, With a Song in My Heart (1952), Pickup on South Street (1953), and Pillow Talk (1959).Another much-nominated actor without a win, Glenn\u0027s most recent Close shave came at the 2019 Oscars, when she was nominated for The Wife. She has previously been nominated six time, including roles in The World According to Garp (1982). Fatal Attraction (1987), and Dangerous Liaisons (1988) .Amy Adams comes just behind Close, with six nominations (including The Fighter, The Master and American Hustle). None of those were for Arrival, the sci-fi film that saw Adams pick up Bafta, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations. Unfortunately, that same year, she was competing against herself in Nocturnal Animals, which likely split the Oscars vote.Richard Burton holds the record for second-most Oscar nominations without a win (seven to Peter O’Toole’s eight). While Burton’s performance in Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is often heralded as his best, the actor lost out to Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons.Peter O\u0027Toole is the Oscar’s most-nominated actor without a win, with eight nods in total. Although the actor did not take home a trophy for Lawrence of Arabia, The Lion in Winter and Goodbye, Mr Chips, O\u0027Toole was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2002.Jake Gyllenhaal has been nominated for one Oscar – for Brokeback Mountain. And while his performance in that film was certainly worthy of the accolade, you could argue the actor deserved nominations just as much for Nightcrawler, Nocturnal Naimals, Stronger, Prisoners, Enemy, and Donnie Darko.

Yet the star of The Master, Walk the Line and Gladiator – all for which he was nominated – has no such award lying around. Instead, Phoenix will have to make do with a Golden Globe, a Grammy (for his work on the Walk the Line soundtrack) and a People’s Choice Award.Angela Bassett has had one of the most prolific careers in Hollywood history, starring in dozens of TV shows and films. Her roles in What\u0027s Love Got to Do with It (1993), Malcolm X (1992) and Music of the Heart (1999) won awards elsewhere – but not with the Academy.Sigourney Weaver on the set of the original Alien film in 1979Despite playing multiple roles that seem like certain Oscar winners, David Oyelowo has never even been nominated for an award. His role as Martin Luther King Jr in 2014’s Selma has gone down as one of the biggest snubs in recent history and was one of many incidents that led to the #OscarsSoWhite movement.One of the most iconic actors of all time, Marilyn Monroe never received an Oscar nomination. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), How to Marry a Millionaire (1953) and Some Like It Hot (1959) may have gone down as classics, but Monroe never stood out enough for the Academy.The Big Lebowski, Fargo, Reservoir Dogs, Miller\u0027s Crossing, Con Air, Armageddon, Big Fish, The Death of Stalin and Barton Fink... just several films Steve Buscemi was not nominated for an Oscar for. In fact, Buscemi has never been nominated for an Academy Award.Three Oscar nominations for Woody Harrelson, and three loses for Woody Harrelson – Larry Flynt in The People vs Larry Flynt (1996), The Messenger (2009) and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017). But, like that widely shared Zombieland GIF, Harrelson will be wiping away the tears with a wedge of dollar bills, his films having made more than $3 billion at the box office worldwide.Mia Farrow may have starred in the classics Rosemary’s Baby, Broadway Danny Rose and The Purple Rose of Cairo, but not a single nomination followed. Surprising for someone who has won three Baftas and a Golden Globe.While many people suspected Idris Elba would score an Oscar nomination for Beasts of No Nation, the Academy’s hatred for Netflix proved too strong (Bafta and the Globes nominated him instead). Even other prime Oscar-bait – Molly’s Game, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, Second Coming – failed to land Elba any nominations. No wonder, perhaps, that the actor has stuck primarily to multi-million-dollar blockbusters.Having had acclaimed roles in American History X, Fight Club and Birdman, Edward Norton will no doubt go down as one of America’s most talented actors. Unfortunately, the actor has no Oscars to show it.By starring in both Lost in Translation and Girl with a Pearl Earring, Scarlett Johansson shot herself slightly in the foot in 2003. For the two roles, she landed double Leading Actress nominations at Bafta (winning for Translation) and two Globes nominations. The Oscars? Not one. And despite standout roles in Lucy, Under the Skin, Match Pint, A Love Song for Bobby Long, she still has never been nominated for an Oscar.Samuel L Jackson is one of the most prolific actors working in Hollywood and has one Oscar nomination – for Pulp Fiction (1995). Considering he’s ranked as the highest all-time box office star, having made over $12 billion worldwide, the Avengers actor’s probably not all that upset.GettySamuel L Jackson poses at a portrait session during day three of the 13th annual Dubai International Film FestivalWith four Oscar nominations under her belt, Michelle Williams somehow still has no statuette placed on her mantelpiece. Her closest call came in 2016, when she starred in Manchester By the Sea, when she was up against the supreme Viola Davis, who went on to win the award for Fences.Few actors can attest to being as hardworking as Annette Bening. Revered for her work onstage, she also won acclaim for Oscar-nominated on-screen roles in The Grifters (1990), American Beauty (1999) and The Kids Are Alright (2010). That she was completely overlooked for 20th Century Women in 2017 was a glaring oversight. Kirk Douglas was a leading man in Hollywood’s Golden Age, his roles in Spartacus, Lust for Life and Champion inspiring a generation of actors after him. Still, the actor never won a competitive Oscar – only an honorary one in 1996, for his 50 years in the creative industry.Irene Dunne – nominated five times – is one of the few recipients of the Kennedy Centre Honours for her service to the performing arts. Yet her performances in Cimarron (1931), Theodora Goes Wild (1936), The Awful Truth (1937), Love Affair (1939) and I Remember Mama (1948) all went unrewarded by the Academy.One of the world’s most accomplished character actors, Arthur Kennedy was best known for his supporting roles in films such as Champion (1949), Trial (1955), Peyton Place (1957) and Some Came Running (1958), all of which won him Oscar nods. And despite a leading actor nomination in 1951 for Lights Out, Kennedy still couldn’t manage a win.One of Britain’s premiere Shakespearean actors, Albert Finney was nominated five times across almost four decades, for Tom Jones (1963), Murder on the Orient Express (1974), The Dresser (1983), Under the Volcano (1984) and Erin Brockovich (2000).Six-time nominee Dame Deborah Kerr famously failed to win for the musical The King and I – losing to Ingrid Bergman in Anastasia. Thankfully, the Academy realised their error years later, awarding Kerr an honorary award and calling her “a dedicated actress whose motion picture career has always stood for perfection, discipline and elegance.Another actor with six nominations and no wins. Even a role in 1950s All About Eve, which would win Best Picture, couldn’t push Thelma Ritter to victory. She went on to be nominated four more times that decade, for The Mating Season (1951, With a Song in My Heart (1952), Pickup on South Street (1953), and Pillow Talk (1959).Another much-nominated actor without a win, Glenn\u0027s most recent Close shave came at the 2019 Oscars, when she was nominated for The Wife. She has previously been nominated six time, including roles in The World According to Garp (1982). Fatal Attraction (1987), and Dangerous Liaisons (1988) .Amy Adams comes just behind Close, with six nominations (including The Fighter, The Master and American Hustle). None of those were for Arrival, the sci-fi film that saw Adams pick up Bafta, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild nominations. Unfortunately, that same year, she was competing against herself in Nocturnal Animals, which likely split the Oscars vote.Richard Burton holds the record for second-most Oscar nominations without a win (seven to Peter O’Toole’s eight). While Burton’s performance in Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is often heralded as his best, the actor lost out to Paul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons.Peter O\u0027Toole is the Oscar’s most-nominated actor without a win, with eight nods in total. Although the actor did not take home a trophy for Lawrence of Arabia, The Lion in Winter and Goodbye, Mr Chips, O\u0027Toole was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2002.He continued: “The people that see you more as a person, they’re gonna come to you as a more rounded being and they’re gonna ask it in a much more sensitive and nuanced way. They ain’t gonna reduce it like that, because they care about the impact of it, and the effect of it.“A lot of the people I’m talking to aren’t respectful of the issue, which is why they’ll reduce it, and they’ll twist it.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspReferencing the recent article that distorted\u0026nbspStormzy’s\u0026nbspquotes about racism existing in the UK, Kaluuya added: “Look at the Stormzy thing\u0026nbsp– boom, and it’s twisted.”Kaluuya appeared alongside Queen \u0026amp Slim star Jodie Turner-Smith on The Graham Norton Show, which was mired with criticism after viewers called out for Jim Carrey for making an “awkward” joke about Margot Robbie’s looks.Queen \u0026amp Slim is in cinemas now.Queen and Slim\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They created posters warning parents against car idling outside the school which were displayed on roads nearby.\u0026nbspNina Gunson, head of the\u0026nbspgirls’ school, said: “The posters are very emotive and they are almost following suit in some of the language that Greta Thunberg has used. ‘Turn off your engines and don’t pollute my air’.”The headteacher said more children are sharing their “dissatisfaction” with policies through eco-committees and they are calling on their families “to be mindful of their world”.\u0026nbspTelevision programmes, like Sir David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II, have helped raise awareness among pupils of the environmental damage caused by plastic pollution. Children as young as seven at Sheffield High School recently made a business pitch to remove single-use plastics from the canteen.\u0026nbspAnd they are increasingly questioning the school’s plans for trips and long-haul flights. “Our eco-agenda has really gained more momentum in recent years. It is so important to our girls so they are really leading this more than they have done in the past,” Ms Gunson said.\u0026nbspPupils now tell their classmates off if they bring in plastic bottles of water, Ms Gunson added. “Greta Thunberg is definitely having an impact but also David Attenborough has had a huge impact.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “There is certainly an increasing appetite among young people for more action on environmental issues, and schools respond to this through things like eco-committees so that it is the pupils who are themselves leading that change.\u0026nbsp“This can involve a wide range of activities, including campaigns to save energy around the school site by switching off lights and plug sockets, encouraging parents not to leave their car engines running outside the school gates, and having a meat-free day each week.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”.

Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.On Thursday, the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold after signals of a pick-up. The minutes of its meeting showed that it expects the UK House Price Index to have risen quite strongly in both the final quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of this year.Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the figures were another sign that the UK housing market has “at least temporarily stepped up a gear”.“Mortgage approvals in December were\u0026nbsphighly likely\u0026nbspsignificantly lifted by increased confidence and reduced uncertainties among housing market participants following the decisive general election result,” he said.Why the calm over interest rates might not lastFigures from the bank on Friday also showed growth in consumer credit, rising\u0026nbspby £1.2bn, while credit card borrowing increased\u0026nbspby the most since February, up by £412m.Household spending has helped to drive Britain’s economy over the past few years, helped by record levels of employment and a recovery in wage growth,\u0026nbspbut there were signs of a slowdown in spending in late 2019.The bank’s data also showed that December saw the biggest increase on record in net purchases of British government bonds by foreign investors –\u0026nbspan increase of £28.6bn. The records date back to 1982.Meanwhile, it emerged that the bank will be repaid €58m (£49m) by the European Central Bank after the UK leaves the European Union. Brexit will mean that the Bank of England pulls out of the European System of Central Banks.The bank holds 14.3 per cent of the European Central Bank’s subscribed capital, of which 3.75 per cent –\u0026nbspequivalent to €58m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspis paid up.

It would most likely be the new USB-C standard or something like it, meaning that Apple would have to change the port used in their iPhones.Apple hits out at EU proposal to force phones to have same chargerEuropean politicians passed the motion by\u0026nbsp582 votes to 10. While it does not introduce any new rules, it calls on the European Commission to examine new legislation, and the Commission has already suggested that it could introduce new rules forcing companies to adopt a single charger.It also suggests that companies should work to ensure they all use the same wireless charging standard. That largely happens already, with most phone companies using the Qi standard.If such a change were to happen, people would no longer need to get a new charger each time they buy a new device, the motion noted.Ten years ago, the European Parliament signed an agreement with technology companies in which they would voluntarily work to reduce the numbers of chargers across different devices.

Last year, the company unveiled the Switch\u0026nbspLite\u0026nbspas well as quietly bumping up the battery life of the larger version of the console. Those were made possible as a consequence of updated Nvidia chips on the inside.EA says people prefer not to play its games on the Nintendo SwitchFurukawa suggested that the console is in its midway phase and that it would be looking for further growth opportunities for the new console.“According to the conventional wisdom for dedicated video game platforms, Nintendo Switch should be entering the midway phase of the hardware lifecycle,” he said. “But we believe we have built a foundation on which we can pursue further growth opportunities for Nintendo Switch.”He pointed to the recent announcement of a special Animal Crossing version of the Switch, which will arrive in Japan alongside the game\u0027s release date in March. That suggests that yet more special designs might come to the Switch, even if there is no update to the hardware inside for 2020.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While its win was a coup for DreamWorks – the film was the studio\u0027s third victor in a row– it was far from a deserving recipient, especially considering Ron Howard won Best Director over Robert Altman and David Lynch for Gosford Park and Mulholland Drive, respectively.219 Chariots of Fire (1981)While Chariots of Fire is precisely the type of film the Academy usually takes under its wing, the fact it won was a big surprise, considering everybody present had expected Reds to win the top prize. The Warren Beatty film would have been a far worthier winner, too.Cold Mountain lucked out by being nominated in what was a particularly weak year for Best Supporting Actress. Renée Zellweger recovered from failing to win for Chicago the previous year and, in doing so, earnt the unremarkable drama its Oscar-winning tag.Viewers of the Oscars have grown used to unexpected victories, but none was more ill-judged than when Paul Haggis\u0027 drama Crash beat Brokeback Mountain to Best Picture.519 Dances with Wolves (1990)It\u0027s quite soul-destroying to think that Dances with Wolves scooped a total of seven Oscars in the same year that Goodfellas was nominated.Alicia Vikander\u0027s performance in The Danish Girl is by no means weak, but it was nothing on Rooney Mara\u0027s affecting turn in Todd Haynes\u0027 film Carol. Had Tom Hooper not won five years before for The King\u0027s Speech, it seems unlikely that the drama would have picked up any nominations.Put simply, The English Patient isn\u0027t a very good film. Of the nine (nine!) Oscars it won, Juliette Binoche\u0027s trophy for Best Supporting Actress was perhaps the most surprising. The French star herself could barely contain her shock. This will most likely be this list\u0027s most controversial placement, but let\u0027s be honest: Gladiator is not the fantastic film it\u0027s regularly hailed as. Ridley Scott\u0027s overlong historical drama boasts plenty of swords-and-sandal bravado, but not much else.The musical Going My Way may have been the biggest cinematic hit of its year, but it certainly wasn\u0027t better that classic noir Double Indemnity, which it beat to win Best Picture. In fact, it\u0027s nowhere near director Leo McCarey\u0027s greatest film (he won six years previous for the Awful Truth and would be nominated again for The Bells of St Mary\u0027s two years later).There\u0027s a reason why Grand Hotel is the only film to ever win Best Picture without receiving a nomination in any other category. An entertaining film, sure, but nothing more.1119 The Greatest Show on Earth (1952)It\u0027s ironic that a film with the word greatest in its title has gone down as one of the worst winners in Oscars history. A prime example of when the Academy voted for spectacle over quality.To those who don\u0027t care about awards ceremonies, Green Book is a crowdpleaser that boasts decent performances from Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. To everyone else, it\u0027s the damp squib that somehow came out of nowhere to snatch Best Picture from under Roma\u0027s nose. The Imitation Game won Best Adapted Screenplay, which begs the question: what the hell was this distinctly average film doing having any nominations at all?Meryl Streep has won enough Oscars for the world to know she\u0027s evidently one of the finest actors who\u0027ll ever live. Her win for The Iron Lady, though, was one Oscar too many.The year of 1999 marked one of the most remarkable Oscar ceremonies in history for the sole reason that the majority of its winners were terrible choices. Right up there was Roberto Benigni, who beat Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) and Edward Norton (American History X) to win Best Actor for, of all things, Life is Beautiful.It might finally be accepted that disgraced film director Roman Polanski shouldn\u0027t be handed accolades, but back in 2003, this was still what the Oscars were doing. He won Best Director for The Pianist, an award the French-Polish filmmaker could have done without.1719 A Place in the SunA Place in the Sun is a fine little film, but fine little films shouldn\u0027t be winning Oscars –\u0026nbspespecially when they see off competition from more deserving opposition. In this case, director George Stevens beat John Huston (The African Queen), William Wyler (Detective Story) and Elia Kazan (A Streetcar Named Desire) to the Director prize.1819 Shakespeare in LoveYou have to hand it to Shakespeare in Love, it played the Oscars campaign trail perfectly, overtaking war favourites Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line to win the evening\u0027s biggest prize. This doesn\u0027t mean its success has gone down as anything more than evidence of poor judgement from the Academy.It\u0027s often good to hold your hands up and admit that a film is nowhere near as good as you recall. Sadly, Slumdog Millionaire is one of those. While its win no doubt put smiles on the faces of commuters reading the morning papers the next day, the shine has worn off its success in recent years. The rightful winner –\u0026nbspThe Dark Knight – wasn\u0027t even nominated for Best Picture.A Beautiful Mind is one of the mustier Best Pictures winners of the century so far.

It also confirms a prediction of Einstein\u0027s general theory of relativity.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFrame-dragging has been spotted on Earth, where satellites have examined the gravitational field of our planet as it rotates. But the effect is very small, difficult to measure and hard to examine.More massive objects, such as neutron stars or white dwarfs, give scientists the chance to examine the phenomenon at a much grander scale.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

The pulsar served as something of a clock: they could watch as the pulses arrived, measuring them very precisely, over a period of twenty years, and watch for changes as they did.Scientists release audio recording of sound of gravitational wavesThey found that the pulses did indeed drift, as predicted by the theory. After discounting other possible causes, they were able to conclude that the drift was caused by the white dwarf causing the phenomenon of frame-dragging.The idea that rotating bodies would be able to drag spacetime\u0026nbsparound with them was first suggested by Austrian\u0026nbspmathematicians Josef\u0026nbspLense\u0026nbspand Hans\u0026nbspThirring, who suggested it three years after Einstein published his\u0026nbspgeneral theory of relativity.Though the effect can be seen at a very minor and subtle level on Earth, using gyroscopes and other technology, it is 100 million times more potent in the case of a rapidly spinning white dwarf.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Conservative Party won with an overall majorityA dog outside a polling station during the general election in NorthumberlandOne poster on the Debt Camel advice website said their payment was an “absolute joke”, adding that they had paid more in interest on\u0026nbspone of their dozens of loans than they would receive in redress. Another wrote: “My claim was £986. I’m getting about £43. It’s an absolute disgrace.”However, some customers were more positive about the payouts. Sam\u0026nbspWindle, who took out loans with\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspseveral years ago, said that although 4.3 per cent was less than he had hoped for, it was better than nothing.His redress amount was initially £5,200 before being reduced to £2,700, of which he received just £121. However, like many other\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspcustomers, he was not aware that he was due compensation until the administrators contacted him.Mr Windle, who has now cleared all of his debts, was at one point paying off around £300 interest to\u0026nbspWonga\u0026nbspon each of seven payday loans. “It was a vicious cycle really. I can honestly say the day I paid it all off was the happiest day of my life.”He added: “The only frustrating about the compensation\u0026nbspis that it was due to be paid in January bit that’s been put back to some point in the next four weeks. The communication from the administrators has been pretty poor really.”Sara Williams, a personal finance expert who runs the Debt Camel website, said: “People were told last year by the Wonga administrators what their compensation amount had been calculated at and they were warned their payout would be ‘significantly less’.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On the average compensation of about £1000, they will get only £43.\u0026nbsp“Some people, remembering the stress the Wonga loans had caused them,\u0026nbsphave described this as an insult and not proper compensation at all.”Wonga had faced a barrage of criticism over the high interest it charged on loans and was accused of targeting those who were most vulnerable.In 2014, the firm wrote off £220m worth of debt belonging to 330,000 customers after admitting making loans to people who could not afford to repay them.Administrators had received 389,621 eligible claims from those said to have been sold unaffordable loans as of August 2019, according to documents filed with Companies House.Prior to its collapse in August 2018, Wonga blamed its difficulties on a “significant” increase in people making claims in relation to historic loans.

This is the slogan of Cambodia since our ancestral times.”Cambodia considers China a valuable diplomatic relationship due to the amount of economic investments and aid the Southeast Asian country receives from the latter.According to the\u0026nbspPhom Penh Post, the prime minister also said cancelling flights to and from China was out of the question\u0026nbspas it would “kill the hospitality and service industry in Cambodia”.“Cancelling flights with China would not be an attack on China.

Cambodia should prioritise greater transparency in preparing the country to respond, including by actively encouraging the involvement of community and civil society leaders in formulating the response to this crisis.“But so far, it’s all been lectures and PM Hun Sen wanting to show bravado by not wearing a face mask,” Mr Roberts added. “This is authoritarianism, pure and simple – and it’s the Cambodian people who will suffer for it.”Sopheap Chak, executive director at the Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR), said in a statement: “The wellbeing of citizens should be the priority, and ought not to be compromised in favour of diplomatic and economic relations.“The government is responsible for these iniduals and should ensure the safety of all Cambodian citizens, regardless of where they are in the world.”Mu Sochua, the exiled deputy leader of the opposing Cambodia National Rescue Party, responded to the announcement in a tweet: “Hun Sen unhappy with Cambodian students for leaving China and not sticking with his friends for life.”There has been one confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus in Cambodia, from a man who travelled to the country from the Chinese city of Wuhan, which is\u0026nbspground zero for the virus.Coronavirus panic is worse than the beast itselfCoronavirus: UK experts race to track down contacts with infected duoForeign Office pulls staff from China as death toll reaches 259Britons evacuated from Wuhan begin 14-day coronavirus quarantineUS bans foreign nationals who have visited China in last two weeksSpeaking after that confirmation,\u0026nbspCambodia’s Minister of Health, Mam Bun Heng, said on Wednesday that the virus could not spread in Cambodia because the “country is just too hot”.The outbreak has infected 11,791 people in China alone and the death toll rose to 259 on Saturday.The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a global emergency on Thursday, which “flipped the switch” from a cautious attitude earlier to recommending governments prepare for the possibility of the virus spreading much more rapidly.The WHO said it was especially concerned about some cases abroad that may involve human-to-human transmission, contrary to what Cambodia’s health minister has said.China suspended plane, bus and train links to Wuhan on 23 January in an effort to contain the disease, with lockdowns taking place in surrounding cities as well.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Almost a chance for them to prove that they are worthy of joining the gang.The -year-old runs Stand United community group which was set up following the death of -year-old family friend Tashaun Aird who was brutally kned to death in Stoke Newington.The teenager was set upon and kned in the chest and back despite telling his attackers he was not part of the Hackney gang, Red Pitch.She added: “Stoke Newington has always been considered the posher side of Hackney and was thought of being up-and-coming.“Some houses are worth more than £million. So what you are essentially saying to younger people is that they can’t afford to buy anything nice around here.“The expensive houses are right next to the poorer parts which does create a rt, it creates a class barrier.“Young people feel as though they are not going to afford a nice place where they’re from unless they join a gang and sell drugs.“Young people are confused and that mentality needs to change.“Gang members aren’t just targeting other gangs – it can happen to anyone. It can be a case of mistaken identity or someone can get caught in the crossfire.“The people in the gangs are also getting younger, some are as young as  and they have no fear. They feel as they can do as they please.”Lara, who as a detention officer sees first hand the trouble on the streets also told a sobering tale of a young boy who pulled out a -inch kne asit was normal when he was arrested.Another Stoke Newington mum, Lena Corner highlighted the issue by appearing on Question Time last week to say her -year-old son had been mugged three times in the past year.The -year-old said: “It’s just that fear he lives with every day. It’s that type of fear you have in your stomach and he has got that.”Just yards from the park where he was mugged, The Sun Online witnessed cops carrying out a stop and search on a group of kids at .pm – highlighting the issues officers are facing in the upmarket area.It comes amid rising fury in the borough – where the majority of residents are aged  to  with young “dependent children” – that not enough is being done to tackle crime.Residents claim the police cant cope with the rise in muggings and stabbings in an area where  burglaries,  robberies and  incidents of anti-social behaviour were recorded last year.Figures show that six per cent of people living in the Stoke Newington ward are unemployed and statistics show that last year , crimes were investigated – but just  offenders were dealt with in court.Another resident added: “It’s getting out of hand in the area – the recent stabbings on Shakspeare Walk, the drug dealing – and the police can’t cope, undoubtedly due to cuts.”Lara, a mum of two young children and two older stepsons, is now calling on parents to do more and spot the early signs of gang grooming.She said: “Parents need to know the signstheir child is being groomed by a gang.“If young people are carrying hundreds of pounds, why are they carrying that amount  How have they got that money “We want to educate parents to spot these signs early and maybe these terrible things on the streets won’t happen.”Lara also highlighted how there are at least four gangs in the Stoke Newington area covering the N post code.She added: “Children will start with mugging and that’s how it begins.“It is happening right on your doorstep, it might not be your children, but it’s happening.“We want to work with parents and local schools to educate children and adults that there is a dferent path they can go down. They can turn their le around.”Her aunt, Mercinth Anderson, , who also helped set up Stand United, said her friend was forced to move her -year-old son back to Jamaica over fears he will get caught up in gang violence.She added: “Unfortunately children are becoming easy targets because they have all of the latest equipment and gear.“They have become too materialistic and have the latest headphones, trainers and smartphones. It is easy pickings for these gangs.“Parents need to think twice about buying their children the latest iPhone because it could make their kids easy targets.“My son was nearly mugged  years ago when he was  outside the police station, the people that are doing it have no shame and no fear.“I’ve been living here  years and this is the worst I’ve seen. I used to tell my son to be home before it was dark and before a certain time.“But timing and whether it’s dark or not doesn’t seem to bother children now. They just don’t care.”The mum-of-one, who organises the Stand United meetings at the local Pedro Club, added: “My friend had to move her son back to Jamaica because of what is going on in London.“But some people aren’t able to do that. They either don’t have family living where or they can’t afford to move away.”University lecturer and local resident Caroline Bolam slammed authorities for “ghetto-ising” the area – and blamed the council for pedestrianising streets.She said: “The council needs to look at the impact of its traffic plans, and there has been a signicant rise in crime since these closures were introduced.“My concern is that the council is ghetto-ising the area – creating quiet alleyways with no cars or headlights where kids can congregate.”It comes as Sun Online analysis of crime stats show the area – made up of around  streets – suffered  violent or sexual offences in .There were also  vehicle crimes,  drug offences and  cases of criminal damage and arson in the area.Just eight per cent of offences investigated in the area resulted in a suspect being charged. Of these, only three per cent of offenders have been dealt with by a court.A further five per cent of cases were dealt with by police through punishments such as a warning or a caution.Met Police statistics claim  per cent of the , offences reported last year are still under investigation. Four per cent have been closed with no further action taken.Stoke Newington has become blighted by kne crime and sits in the borough of Hackney, which has one of the worst kne possession rates in London.In November , there were  kne-point robberies on Brooke Road and Narford Road alone.In each incident cash and debit cards were stolen from terried victims.Dad-of-five Steven Brown, , died after being stabbed in the heart outside a builder’s merchants on Mathias Road on April  last year.A total of  people have been arrested in connection with the broad daylight attack and later released or bailed. So far no-one has been charged.Just last month, police released CCTV of a suspect after a member of staff was glassed in the face and two others were punched in the face inside the Three Crowns pub on Stoke Newington High Street.Mum-of-three Mrs Corner told Question Time her son was mugged by an older gang who threatened to stab him in January last year before being targeted again in broad daylight in Clissold Park.The third mugging came just a week later in the same park when a gang took his phone and forced him to give then his cash card PIN number and Apple ID.She later told Thegetting mugged has become “the norm” for local children and said cops “completely bungled” efforts to catch her son’s attacker.Mrs Corner also blamed the number of children excluded from schools and cuts to policing for the increase in muggings.She said: “It’s not a good way to spend your childhood. Teenagers round here have totally changed the way they behave and socialise as a result of all these muggings.“It’s notyou’ll get mugged but when and how many times  It’s asnow it’s an accepted part of growing up.“I don’t like criticising the police but the investigation seemed completely incompetent.”The Sun Online has contacted Scotland Yard for comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The time to jump ship isnt when there are serious problems.The Queen pulled no punches when she sat down with Prince Harry after he and Meghan released the bombshell news they were quitting.At a summit in Sandringham, her Majesty laid down the law - saying they can no longer formally represent her despite the couple insisting they wanted to fly the flag for the Queen after quitting the Firm.In her decisive statement, the -year-old monarch also revealed the couple would pay back the £.m of taxpayer money spent on refurbishing Frogmore Cottage.Under the new deal, Harry and Meghan will retain their HRH status — but have agreed to not use their titles while trying to forge a new le in North America.It has since been reported Kate Middleton will be front and centre of the Royal Family with Prince William vowing Megxit wont ruin their plans.A source claimed : William knows he will have a lot more work this year and is happy to perform whatever duties the Queen asks of him. But he is determined that won’t be to the detriment of his charity work.It comes after speculation of a feud between brothers William and Harry during the so-called Megxit drama, with it claimed they have since made peace.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He will surely find himself in court very soon.This week a senior US attorney, Geoffrey Berman, said the prince had offered “zero co-operation” to the FBI and prosecutors.This is over his friendship with the paedophile sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.Andrew admits he kept his friendship going with this horrible financier for longer than he should.No kidding, your highness. You still visited the bloke after he had been convicted of having sex with an underage girl. There has been no convincing explanation as to why you should have done so. Indeed, when you tried to explain it, on TV to the BBC’s Emily Maitlis, you sounded both deluded and deceitful.But there’s worse, of course. With Andy, somehow, there always is.He is himself accused of having sex with a -year-old lass procured for him by Epstein.This is Virginia Roberts. She is one of five women bringing a suit against the now dead Epstein and they want Prince Andrew to testy.Andy denies ever having laid a finger on Roberts. Well, OK, maybe a finger , but nowt more.Andrew has been implicated in this grotesque scandal for a long time now. The sensible thing to have done would have been to speak to the US investigators right at the outset.Becauseyou’ve got nothing to hide, there’s nothing to worry about, is there, matey But Prince Andrew’s actions have not appeared as the actions of a man with nothing to hide. He has preicated at every stage. He needs to understand that just because he says he is innocent of everything, it doesn’t mean everybody has to believe him, you know And there are plenty out there who certainly do not believe him.Sources close to Prince Andrew say he is “angry” and “bewildered” over the accusation that he offered the FBI zero co-operation.Well sure. He’s always bewildered. He’d be bewildered by a piece of paper with “see other side” written on both sides. He’d be sitting there trying to work it out for ages. He is not the sharpest tool in the box.If you’re angry and bewildered, your royal personage, then give the FBI a ring first thing tomorrow morning, US time, and tell them you are anxious to help in their inquiries.Because until this business is sorted out, there is a dark cloud over the Royal Family. And thus a dark cloud over Britain.The terrible suspicion is that our Royal Family is coming apart at the seams.Put all of our minds at rest, Andrew. Talk to the police. And tell the truth.THE Scots have banned the smacking of children by their parents.Braying the bairns was a kind of national sport up there. I think people in Carlisle and Berwick could make a killing.Set up special centres where Scottish mums and dads can cross the border and beat their children without fear of punishment.You could sell special souvenir slippers or canes marked with “I Came To Carlisle To Bray The Kids”.A WOMAN with an apparent IQ of a small bowl of Maltesers has demanded that firms stop men chatting about football in the workplace. Ann Francke is from the Chartered Management Institute.She says that saying stuff like, “Hey, Leeds tore our lads a new a**ehole on Tuesday night” excludes women.No it doesn’t! It doesn’t exclude women who like football, does it  Whereas it does exclude men who couldn’t give a toss about the Leeds v Millwall game.Should we continue this sexist stereotyping and ban women from talking about Strictly or vaginal yeast infections What, under your regime, Ann, would people be allowed to talk about  Every subject excludes someone.TURKEY – the world’s worst country, in my view – is to introduce a “marry your rapist” law.A man charged with rape will be let off scot-freehe agrees to marry his victim.What the woman – or perhaps more usually, girl – thinks about this will not be taken into consideration.All this is part of president Tayyip Erdogans fervent wish to drag Turkey back into the seventh century.And he is having great success in his ambition.WELCOME to the world of , a newspaper for rich, stupid people living in North London.In yesterday’s issue they were terried about what to put in their morning cup of tea, other than tea.Milk is out because of greenhouse gases caused by the dairy industry.

Almond milk is unkind to bees.What can they do  Can I suggest dandruff  Scrape it off your head and shove it in your cup.There was also a truly hilarious piece about wild swimming by an idiot called Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett.She says it’s an elitist activity. And for rich people to pretend they’re not part of the capitalist system which drives climate change.No, not kidding. : A world beyond parody.I WONDERour new Government has made its first big mistake.Allowing the Chinese company Huawei a role in the development of G seems to me both naive and immoral.If you deal with a Chinese company the size of Huawei, you are basically dealing with the Chinese government.And this a regime that is trying to stle freedom of speech and democracy across its vast territory. Most obviously, in its bullying of Hong Kong.But worse than that is its treatment of Muslim Chinese people in the west of the country. Thousands upon thousands are held in “re-education” camps. Not to mention their occupation of Tibet.More pragmatically, China is a hostile, totalitarian, Communist country. The notion it will act in good faith is frankly laughable.

And we think that we are doing well when we’re not.“And we think we’re doing badly when we’re not.“And we just haven’t learnt how to understand the public.“And we should be out there amongst the publicwe really want to understand what’s happening.”The report was written by election co-ordinator Ian Lavery and was presented to the party’s NEC.The report said it would be “unrealistic” to say their Brexit policy played no part in the defeat.But it failed to criticise Mr Corbyn’s leadership or the party’s radical policies - laying the blame with the media.It said: “It should be noted, however, that our radical manesto and Jeremy Corbyn were attacked in  on identical grounds and with comparable venom, yet Labour secured the biggest increase in its share of the vote since .“It is unlikely that radicalism was in itself the problem in a country looking for change.”Brexit and the party’s second referendum stance were to blame, it concludes. Not Corbyn’s lunatic plan to transform Britain into Venezuela. Not his anti-Semitism or terrorist friends. Millions of people only loathed and feared him because a hostile Press tricked them.This is pant-wettingly brilliant material written by two clowns who cannot admit that the ideology they have devoted their lives to is toxic to voters.But it has serious consequences.Becausethey turn a deaf ear to reality and reheat their Marxist claptrap again they will get the same result.AndLabour has managed to survive until , it won’t be for long.It added: “There is also little doubt that four years of unrelenting attacks on the character of the party leader, an assault without precedent in modern politics, had a degree of negative impact.”It also said it was “deeply regrettable” that the party did not convince the public that it was dealing with anti-Semitism.A Labour Party spokesman declined to comment on the leaked report. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There have also been instances of protesting fire- fighters setting themselves alight — albeit with fire extinguishers on hand to douse the flames.You are much more likely to have seen these disturbing scenes on social media than on the television news, probably because such images don’t fit with the anti-Brexit narrative of most UK broadcasters.You see, it was supposed to be Britain that collapsed into chaos, while our continental neighbours basked in the stability allegedly afforded by European Union membership.Most of us are vaguely aware that the image we are often presented of President Emmanuel Macron as the smooth-talking glamour boy of modern European politics is somewhat at odds with the situation on the ground in his country.We have heard a bit about the gilets jaunesprotesters who have been staging huge and sometimes violent protests every weekend across France for more than a year now.But despite France being our closest continental neighbour, we don’t quite know what is going on or why — mainly because these extraordinary scenes are so seldom explained or even covered by flagship news programmes.The truth is that civil stre in France, including the sheer level of violence and fury now being directed at its political establishment and at the police who enforce their will, is in danger of spiralling out of control.In painful contrast to La Belle Epoque, the famous “beautul era” of creativity and gracious living France enjoyed for the  years before the First World War, the country is now sliding into Le Mal Epoque — the bad times, which show little sign of ending.The immediate cause of the latest protests is Macron’s economic reform programme, a dose of unpleasant medicine the French economy probably needs to digest but which its powerful and militant trade unions have no intention of allowing to pass.Macron aims to abolish ious “sweetheart” pension deals enjoyed by dferent occupations, including many public sector groups, and create in their place a single national pension scheme he says will be more affordable and fairer for all.Some groups face having their pensions calculated on their career average earnings for the first time, rather than their final salaries at retirement, as  separate schemes are rolled into one. Everyone is faced with working longer, as the retirement age rises from  to  .Macron is also taking a tougher line on the pay and traditionally quite lax working practices of French public sector employees, which is what the firefighters have taken particular objection to.A six-week transport strike has just ended, while the country is also suffering from a wave of power cuts as electricity workers withdraw their labour.When you throw into the mix other major social problems, such as the alienation and chronic high unemployment suffered by youths from ethnic minorities in the “Banlieues” — grim outer estates that encircle Paris and other major French cities — and the ever-present threat of Islamist terrorist atrocities, then the multiple sources of pessimism and anger among the French public become clear.And that is before the famous gilets jaunes are taken into the equation. These protesters, mainly provincial, traditionally-minded people from small towns and villages, began their demonstrations as a protest against punitive new rates of tax on petrol that Macron had introduced to the acclaim of environmentalists and other fashionable metropolitan groups.That grievance has now morphed into a more general contention that Macron is a president for the rich and well-connected.Leftist union leaders have started to ape the language of the gilets jaunes.Firebrand Philippe Martinez — a kind of French Arthur Scargill — says Macron and his inner-circle are disconnected from reality and need to “shake the hands of a few who actually work”.In British terms, modern France is perhaps best likened to our experience in the s and early ’s, characterised by excessive trade union power, strikes, riots, terrorism, outbursts of police brutality and a general pervading sense of aggression on the streets.With the next French presidential election shaping up as a choice between more Macron or Marine Le Pen, with her Far-Right connections, some in France have started to look across the Channel for a better example.Leading lights in the centre-right Republican Party have even praised Boris Johnson as offering, “a third way between globalists and populists”.As Britain gets ready for a Brexit knees-up tomorrow, with no sign of violence despite the years of political angst we have gone through, we should count our blessings.Many in France would give almost anything to be in our shoes right now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I suddenly had to find a months money.I didnt know what I was going to do.Nichola, who works for a charity and used to be a benefits adviser, wasnt eligible for the Flexible Support Fund or a budgeting loan to help with the costs.She added: I looked at every opportunity for some help, but I dont have a wealthy family, or someone in the area to look after my child.Nichola says the current system unfairly penalises lower earners, when other childcare systems dont require Brits to fork up upfront.And like many working mums, over the school holidays she has to folk out thousands of pounds extra upfront too.Its women who are struggling the most here,  per cent of single-parent families are women, she added.I dread to think what its like for people on minimum wage, how they can afford it.How can you justy paying childcare costs upfront for someone earning £, in advance, but not someone who is on £, Its so frustrating, so detrimental, to iniduals lives, and potentially hundreds of thousands of lives.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Luckily her new job allowed her to cut her hours and work from home to make the situation work for her.But she hopes the DWP will shake-up the system for it to help others in future get back into work.A DWP spokesperson said: We cannot comment on an ongoing case."},{"url":null,"title":"eu uk leave brexit independent","story":"Forty-seven years and  days after we joined. Three decades since the rot set in with the drive towards a United States of Europe. Seven years after David Cameron promised a referendum and ½ traumatic years since Leave won it. It is hard to exaggerate the magnitude of this moment.Or the relief that Brexit, after all the ision and rancour, will at last be done. That our democracy ­ultimately prevailed over those who fought to thwart it.Other EU nations saw their referendums overturned or ignored. We would not be bullied into a rethink.It is true that nothing much will change this year during the “transition period”. But at pm Brexit becomes irreversible.We will be the first country to leave the EU. And in The Sun’s view we will never rejoin, never again surrender our independence.Instead we will be firing the starting gun on a new era full of excitement, potential and promise:The birth of a new Britain, setting our own laws, controlling our borders and trading independently with the entire world.This will not be Little Britain — quite the opposite. Brexit is not some nostalgic fantasy about the Empire.We will be outward-looking, a magnet for the brightest and best migrants — and for those already making a living here, a permanent, welcoming home.Many Sun readers will be ecstatic to be out. Some not so much. We understand that.But this paper — which was always pro-Common Market but increasingly eurosceptic as the EU grabbed more and more of our ­sovereignty — backed leaving all the way.So we want to pay tribute here to the heroes of Brexit, the men and women without whom it would never have happened:Boris Johnson, who went from eurosceptic Brussels reporter to charismatic figurehead of the Leave campaign and finally to the Prime Minister whose election victory last December  assured he could deliver Brexit.Michael Gove, his cerebral and articulate Cabinet ally who sacriced political and personal friendships to fight for his principles.Dominic Cummings, the campaign genius who with Matthew Elliott and the Vote Leave team triumphed against huge odds in  and last year helped orchestrate Boris’s ­decisive win at the polls.Nigel Farage, the controversial former Ukip chief whose pressure forced David Cameron in  to offer a referendum — and whose Brexit Party then terried the Tories into getting serious about delivering Brexit in full . . . out of the single market and customs union.Dan Hannan, the brains behind the project for  years, whose powers of persuasion rallied Tories to the cause. His ally Douglas Carswell was pivotal too.Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith, Steve Baker, Bill Cash and their ERG of Tory backbenchers whose refusal to compromise was admirable, evenThe Sun did despair of it when it threatened to destroy Brexit entirely.They have been vindicated. As has the ERG’s founder, the late ex-Tory MP Michael Spicer.We salute the Tory Cabinet ministers who campaigned for Brexit — notably Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers.From the Labour benches, Gisela Stuart and Kate Hoey shattered the Left’s bizarre consensus that the EU is a near-flawless bastion of liberal values and backed Leave.Ex-Labour MP Caroline Flint, like millions of other Remainers, insisted that upholding the result and our democracy was paramount.But other heroes and heroines planted the seeds of Brexit much earlier.Such as Corbyn’s idol Tony Benn, who before the first referendum on our Common Market membership in  rightly said it “would mean the end of Britain as a completely self-governing nation”.Margaret Thatcher, who in  discovered EC president Jacques Delors plotting to hand back union powers she had removed. She was having none of that — as her famous Bruges speech made clear.Later, as calls grew for yet more Brussels control, she told the Commons: “No, no, no.”The Sun’s “Up Yours, Delors” front page in  summarised our own feelings.Eurosceptic tycoon James Goldsmith launched the Referendum Party in  with just one policy: a vote on EU membership. Three years later Ukip picked up the baton.But not all our Brexit heroes backed Brexit.Many of its most outspoken opponents inadvertently steered millions towards Leave, hardened their resolve and even turned Remainers into Brexiteers:David Cameron, who promised a referendum he was far too confident he would win and catastrophically misjudged the electorate.George Osborne, whose apocalyptic predictions failed to terry Leave voters.Angela Merkel, whose refusal to give Cameron a better deal for Britain cost both dear.And the EU’s Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk and Michel Barnier, whose sneering and threats emboldened rather than cowed us. Likewise the EUParliament’s Guy Verhofstadt, who foolishly let a camera crew capture his team boasting of turning the UK into a “colony”. Imagine the effect that had.Then, of course, there’s Jeremy ­Corbyn, who damaged the Remain campaign and then gted Boris a stonking mandate.And ex-Lib Dem leader Jo “revoke Brexit” Swinson, who agreed to last month’s election under the delusion she could win it — but managed only to lose her own seat.There’s John Bercow, the ex-Speaker whose blatant bias and constitutional trickery convinced Leavers they made the right call. And his arrogant Tory co-conspirators Dominic Grieve and Oliver Letwin, who hoped to establish a Remainer pseudo-Government to enforce a second referendum — testing the public’s patience to their own destruction.Let’s not forget too the former Tories who merely pretended to “respect the referendum”, notably Anna Soubry, who then said single market and customs union membership was inevitable and charmingly told Leavers: “Suck it up”. And how about the glittering cast of Remoaner foghorns Take Tony Blair who, but for The Sun and others, would have forced us  years ago into the disastrous euro — the “burning building with no exits” as William Hague accurately described it.Blair, who then opened our borders to a flood of low-skilled migrants, ­further exposing the folly of free movement.Or his old spin doctor Alastair Campbell and former lackey Andrew Adonis, whose deranged doom-mongering and playground insults hardened Leavers’ hearts and repelled pragmatic Remainers at the same time.Or John Major, whose decision to adopt the  Maastricht Treaty, tying us even closer to the EU — but without a referendum — turbo-charged euroscepticism. A man whose increasingly shrill anti-Brexit outbursts merely convinced Leavers they were right.And how about the clueless celebs who thought abusing Leavers would compel them to think the “correct” thoughts  Or the BBC, whose routine europhile propaganda delivered vast numbers of votes for Leave  But there are Brexit heroes still greater than any of these:They are the .million voters, many Sun readers among them, who braved every threat and every slur, backed Leave in  and stuck to their guns last December.The Sun salutes you.Brexit will not be plain sailing.

Sleep issues are complicated, encompassing many areas of health.“By working through my  three core principles of sleep — Behaviour, Environment and Diet — you will address many of the basic areas of sleep hygiene that can help you on the way to achieving the sleep of your dreams.”Rob believes that everything you do during the day can affect the way you sleep.The principles of B.E.D. cover everything from how you spend your time in the evening , what your bedroom looks likeand the food you choose to eat .On average, we spend around a third of our lives asleep.The recommended amount of kip for adults is between seven and nine hours each night but this may dfer depending on your age, sex, health and other factors.Before teenage years, children generally require more sleep, which helps to support growth and development.So how much shut-eye do you actually need :BABIES: Young infants need around  hours of sleep at night and approximately two-and-a-half hours during the day.PRE-SCHOOLERS: Under-fives require -and-a-half hours at night and a daytime nap of around one hour and  minutes.PRIMARY-AGED CHILDREN: Up to  years, kids need between nine-and-a-half hours and  hours.TEENAGERS: Nine hours.ADULTS: From the age of  upwards, we need between seven and nine hours.OAPs: Sleep requirement reduces in advancing years to between seven and eight hours.CHEESE GIVES YOU NIGHTMARES: Cheese contains an amino acid called tyramine, which is a common trigger  for migraines. It also triggers the release of a hormone called norepinephrine that can stimulate the brain. Both these factors  may inhibit sleep.COUNTING SHEEP: With this trick for dozing off, it does not matter what you count. If it is sheep jumping over a fence, it is the   visualisation aspect that is important. Focusing on that can help distract you from thinking – and the repetition will hopefully lull you to sleep in double-quick time.TAKE A WARM BATH: A warm soak in the tub will ensure that your body experiences rapid cool-down afterwards, which will make you feel sleepy.WEAR SOCKS: The additional layer can improve circulation in  the feet, which might mean you drop off quicker.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At times like this we all - staff, students, and friends across the city - pull together and support one another.“We are monitoring the situation closely and we will continue to provide as much advice, care and support as we can to anyone.”A hotel spokesperson said: We have now received confirmation that two guests staying in one of our apartments in York have been tested positive for the coronavirus.We have been advised by Public Health England that there is minimal ongoing risk of infection to either guests or staff, and as such our York property remains open for business.They added the apartment has been thoroughly disinfected and PHE has been providing support.The two patients are being treated by Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in its specialist Airborne High Consequences Infectious Disease Centre .Professor Sharon Peacock said PHE is contacting people who had close contact - defined as being within two metres of the infected person for  minutes - with the pair.It comes as a desperate hunt is on to find  people who flew in to the UK from coronavirus epicentre Wuhan before travel was locked down.Authorities are now desperately scrambling to contain the spiralling epidemic with fears almost , could be infected in the country.The Department of Health confirmed they still need to check more than  people who arrived on direct flights from Wuhan earlier this month.Yesterday they said  of the , people have already left the UK, while  are now outside of the bugs two-week incubation period.The virus attacks the respiratory system, causing lung lesions.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.The symptoms include:In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract , it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.There is no vaccine for coronavirus.In  an outbreak of a similar virus, SARS, infected more than , people in  countries before it was brought under control, killing  of those worldwide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It can also be incorporated into soaps.Chloroxylenol is poisonousingested and it should not be used as an aerosol that people may breathe.Whether it offers any advantage over standard cleaning and washing with soap and water is unclear.Paul Kellam, professor of virus genomics at Imperial College London said: I would not think Dettol has been tested for activity against the -nCoV.Nevertheless the manufacturers claim killing activity to a iety of microbes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit what happens now after","story":"w.mantis  Brexit: What happens now after the UK officially leaves the EU n Britain will wake up on Saturday morning to a new era - but what will it mean for you and your loved ones  Heres a round up of what happens next n More than three-and-a-half years after the country voted to leave the European Union, the UK will wake up to a new era on Saturday morning.  nThat historic decision back in June  has ided the nation and will be greeted by a mixture of joy, sadness and relief - but also uncertainty.  nWhat does our departure actually mean for our economy, our laws and our place on the world stage   nHow - and when - will the biggest constitutional change in half a century impact on the lives of you and your loved ones   n Here we take a look at what Brexit means for you: nWhat has changed   n  n   nNot much. Although this is the legal moment the UK becomes the first nation ever to leave the EU, in practical terms you’ll notice very little dference.  nThat’s because we are in a ‘transition period’ until the end of the year during which the UK will continue to follow EU rules - although we won’t have any say in them as British MEPs have lost their jobs and the UK won’t attend any more summits. It will also keep paying into the EU’s budget.  nBlue passports stripped of EU branding will start being issued to all new applicants, instead of the old burgundy ones, and m special p coins will enter circulation.  n Jeremy Corbyn gives Brexit message declaring apostoday is only the beginningapos   nWhat happens next   n  n   nThe UK can now formally begin trade talks with other countries, like the US and Australia, so they are ready to kick in at the end of the year.  nThe Government will be hoping for some quick wins so it can show it is making a success of Brexit.  nA new team within No , headed by the PM’s chief Europe adviser David Frost, will lead the UK’s trade talks with the EU, our biggest trading partner.  nThey’re only expected to get going properly in March after the EU agrees its negotiating “mandate” - and many believe they won’t be finished on time.  nCan the transition period be extended   nThe Brexit deal says the transition period can go on for another two years - until the end of . But the government passed a law banning any extension to show how serious it is about leaving.  nBut it can still change its mind right up to the end of June. Beyond that, the  December becomes a hard deadline.  nWe will continue to follow EU rules for the rest of the year and start paying our £bn ‘orce bill’ to the EU which stretch for several years. n Jubilant Brexit backers descend on Parliament for aposmost exciting moment of their leapos   nWill the trade talks be a success   n  n   nThe Government hopes so as they were touted as one of the biggest benefits of Brexit, but they have very little time.  nAny deals with other countries are likely to require controversial trade-offs, such as any agreement with the US over food standards and the NHS.  nEU officials are sceptical we’ll be able to strike a deal within the year.  nIf we do, there will be a new set of rules from  January .  nIf not, we could crash out on ‘WTO terms’ - the basic rules that slap high tarfs and restrictions on trade.  nWhat will Boris Johnson do next   nNo is desperate to move on from Brexit and to focus on domestic policy. The PM will have a big Cabinet reshuffle and is expected to make a string of announcements that benefit new Tory constituencies in the Midlands and North.  nHe won his election victory on a promise of “levelling up” the British economy with greater investment into areas devastated by a decade of Tory austerity.  nBut with tough trade talks and another looming deadline, Brexit isn’t going away, eventhe PM has restricted parliamentary scrutiny of the next phase.   nWill our economy be stronger after Brexit   n  n   nThe full consequences of Brexit are uncertain. Much depends on whether we get a trade deal with the EU. Without one, the UK will “fall out” onto damaging WTO terms.  nEvenMr Johnson manages to strike a Canada-style agreement with the EU, the Treasury’s own forecasts estimate that Britain’s economy would be .% smaller - more than £bn a year - after  years than it would bewe’d stayed in the EU.  nThe Government claims the economy could be boosted by trade deals with other countries - but the long-promised “Brexit idend” looks unlikely. n Inside Boris Johnsonaposs exclusive Brexit bash with English sparkling wine but no champagne   nAnd what about our place on the world stage   nMr Johnson has promised post-Brexit Britain will be an outward-looking global power, building on relationships with old Commonwealth allies and newer “Five Eyes” security partners.  nBy leaving the EU we may have more freedom, but we will also have markedly less clout in a world where the three major global hubs are the US, China and the EU.  n For decades Britain saw itself as a bridge between Europe and the US - but with Brexit and Donald Trump those relationships are under strain. nAnd while we remain a major global economy, our departure from the single market makes us less attractive to many foreign investors.  nIf the UK splinters after Brexit, with Scotland going it alone, it could put at risk its right to a seat on the United Nations Security Council.  nWill I still be able to travel to Europe   n  n   nUK nationals will still be able to live, work and drive in the EU as they do now until the end of the transition. Future travel restrictions will be hammered out over the next  months.  nYou won’t need a visa from  January you’re a tourist. But British citizens will no longer be able to spend more than three months in the EU without applying for a work or study visa.  nYou may also need to show aticket, that you have enough money for your stay, and stop using EU passport lanes at European borders.  nThe UK will bring in its own immigration system to control EU migration from the end of the year - though the Government always had the option of reducing immigration from outside the EU, but chose not to for economic reasons.   nWhatI fall ill on holiday   n \" data-content-type \"picture \" id \"_ea-ee-dc-b-fcdd \" src \"internal: article  \" width \" \"    n   nYou will be able to continue getting treatment in EU hospitals as you do now until the end of the transition period.  nAfter that, the European Health Insurance Card , which gives Brits access to EU healthcare in an emergency, will no longer work.  nThere will not be one EU-wide regime on healthcare so it is up to the UK to strike “reciprocal” health cover with inidual states.  nA pact with Spain - home to , British expats - is likely to be among the first agreed.  nButno deals to look after each others’ citizens are struck, British travellers will require adequate health insurance, while EU migrants here will be charged £ a year to use the NHS.   nWhat will happen to EU citizens   nEU citizens can continue arriving freely in the UK to live and work until  December . But they must apply by June  for “settled status”, which gives them the right to stay in the UK.  nThose who haven’t lived in the UK for five continuous years have to apply twice - first for “pre-settled status”, then again for settled status when the hit the five-year mark.  nAfter the transition period, new EU migrants will be subject to a points-based immigration system.  nThey will have to prove their skills and probably earn a minimum salary.  n Keir Starmer says he would bring back EU freedom of movement as Prime Minister   nWill I still get my workersapos rights   nThe Government will set its own workers’ rights after the transition with many fearing they will be watered down - or dropped entirely.  nCurrently the EU has limits on night work and requirements for daily and weekly rest breaks.  nIt also sets a -hour limit on the working week while giving employees the right to four weeks’ paid annual leave, plus bank holidays.  nSome expect anti-age discrimination measures to be removed - meaning there will be little or no protection for younger or older workers.  nAgency workers could be stripped of their right to equal treatment as permanent staff. Ministers have said they will continue maternity rights but there are no guarantees.   nWhat  changes for me from January    n  n   nYou will no longer be guaranteed free mobile phone roaming in the EU as the issue will be left to operators. Duty free willon flights and boats to the EU. But there are likely to be some checks on lorries and vehicles crossing the Channel that could lead to delays. There will also be new checks on goods crossing between Britain and Northern Ireland under the terms of the Irish backstop. You may also need an international driving permit as well as a ‘green cardapos to prove you have the right car insurance and a GB bumper sticker. Pet owners can carry on bringing their animals to the EU on ‘pet passports’ until December, but after will need to obtain a health certicate. The Supreme Court will be the highest court of appeal in the UK and there will be no direct role for the European Court of Justice in British le.   nIs the Union under threat   n Boris Johnson has spoken about the “awesome foursome” of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. nBut Brexit may be the catalyst which breaks up the country, with nationalist sentiment on the rise in Scotland and a steady march towards a reunied Ireland bolstered by the limited border down the Irish Sea.

Although this is the legal moment the UK becomes the first nation ever to leave the EU, in practical terms you’ll notice very little dference. nThat’s because we are in a ‘transition period’ until the end of the year during which the UK will continue to follow EU rules - although we won’t have any say in them as British MEPs have lost their jobs and the UK won’t attend any more summits. It will also keep paying into the EU’s budget. nBlue passports stripped of EU branding will start being issued to all new applicants, instead of the old burgundy ones, and m special p coins will enter circulation. n Jeremy Corbyn gives Brexit message declaring today is only the beginning  nThe UK can now formally begin trade talks with other countries, like the US and Australia, so they are ready to kick in at the end of the year. nThe Government will be hoping for some quick wins so it can show it is making a success of Brexit. nA new team within No , headed by the PM’s chief Europe adviser David Frost, will lead the UK’s trade talks with the EU, our biggest trading partner. nThey’re only expected to get going properly in March after the EU agrees its negotiating “mandate” - and many believe they won’t be finished on time. nThe Brexit deal says the transition period can go on for another two years - until the end of . But the government passed a law banning any extension to show how serious it is about leaving. nBut it can still change its mind right up to the end of June. Beyond that, the  December becomes a hard deadline. nWe will continue to follow EU rules for the rest of the year and start paying our £bn ‘orce bill’ to the EU which stretch for several years.  n Jubilant Brexit backers descend on Parliament for most exciting moment of their le  nThe Government hopes so as they were touted as one of the biggest benefits of Brexit, but they have very little time. nAny deals with other countries are likely to require controversial trade-offs, such as any agreement with the US over food standards and the NHS. nEU officials are sceptical we’ll be able to strike a deal within the year. nIf we do, there will be a new set of rules from  January . nIf not, we could crash out on ‘WTO terms’ - the basic rules that slap high tarfs and restrictions on trade. nNo is desperate to move on from Brexit and to focus on domestic policy. The PM will have a big Cabinet reshuffle and is expected to make a string of announcements that benefit new Tory constituencies in the Midlands and North. nHe won his election victory on a promise of “levelling up” the British economy with greater investment into areas devastated by a decade of Tory austerity. nBut with tough trade talks and another looming deadline, Brexit isn’t going away, eventhe PM has restricted parliamentary scrutiny of the next phase.  nThe full consequences of Brexit are uncertain. Much depends on whether we get a trade deal with the EU. Without one, the UK will “fall out” onto damaging WTO terms. nEvenMr Johnson manages to strike a Canada-style agreement with the EU, the Treasury’s own forecasts estimate that Britain’s economy would be .% smaller - more than £bn a year - after  years than it would bewe’d stayed in the EU. nThe Government claims the economy could be boosted by trade deals with other countries - but the long-promised “Brexit idend” looks unlikely.  n Inside Boris Johnsons exclusive Brexit bash with English sparkling wine but no champagne  nMr Johnson has promised post-Brexit Britain will be an outward-looking global power, building on relationships with old Commonwealth allies and newer “Five Eyes” security partners. nBy leaving the EU we may have more freedom, but we will also have markedly less clout in a world where the three major global hubs are the US, China and the EU. n For decades Britain saw itself as a bridge between Europe and the US - but with Brexit and Donald Trump those relationships are under strain.  nAnd while we remain a major global economy, our departure from the single market makes us less attractive to many foreign investors. nIf the UK splinters after Brexit, with Scotland going it alone, it could put at risk its right to a seat on the United Nations Security Council. nUK nationals will still be able to live, work and drive in the EU as they do now until the end of the transition. Future travel restrictions will be hammered out over the next  months. nYou won’t need a visa from  January you’re a tourist. But British citizens will no longer be able to spend more than three months in the EU without applying for a work or study visa. nYou may also need to show aticket, that you have enough money for your stay, and stop using EU passport lanes at European borders. nThe UK will bring in its own immigration system to control EU migration from the end of the year - though the Government always had the option of reducing immigration from outside the EU, but chose not to for economic reasons.  nYou will be able to continue getting treatment in EU hospitals as you do now until the end of the transition period. nAfter that, the European Health Insurance Card , which gives Brits access to EU healthcare in an emergency, will no longer work. nThere will not be one EU-wide regime on healthcare so it is up to the UK to strike “reciprocal” health cover with inidual states. nA pact with Spain - home to , British expats - is likely to be among the first agreed. nButno deals to look after each others’ citizens are struck, British travellers will require adequate health insurance, while EU migrants here will be charged £ a year to use the NHS.  nEU citizens can continue arriving freely in the UK to live and work until  December . But they must apply by June  for “settled status”, which gives them the right to stay in the UK. nThose who haven’t lived in the UK for five continuous years have to apply twice - first for “pre-settled status”, then again for settled status when the hit the five-year mark. nAfter the transition period, new EU migrants will be subject to a points-based immigration system. nThey will have to prove their skills and probably earn a minimum salary. n Keir Starmer says he would bring back EU freedom of movement as Prime Minister  nThe Government will set its own workers’ rights after the transition with many fearing they will be watered down - or dropped entirely. nCurrently the EU has limits on night work and requirements for daily and weekly rest breaks. nIt also sets a -hour limit on the working week while giving employees the right to four weeks’ paid annual leave, plus bank holidays. nSome expect anti-age discrimination measures to be removed - meaning there will be little or no protection for younger or older workers. nAgency workers could be stripped of their right to equal treatment as permanent staff. Ministers have said they will continue maternity rights but there are no guarantees.  nYou will no longer be guaranteed free mobile phone roaming in the EU as the issue will be left to operators. Duty free willon flights and boats to the EU. But there are likely to be some checks on lorries and vehicles crossing the Channel that could lead to delays. There will also be new checks on goods crossing between Britain and Northern Ireland under the terms of the Irish backstop. You may also need an international driving permit as well as a ‘green card to prove you have the right car insurance and a GB bumper sticker. Pet owners can carry on bringing their animals to the EU on ‘pet passports’ until December, but after will need to obtain a health certicate. The Supreme Court will be the highest court of appeal in the UK and there will be no direct role for the European Court of Justice in British le.  n Boris Johnson has spoken about the “awesome foursome” of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  nBut Brexit may be the catalyst which breaks up the country, with nationalist sentiment on the rise in Scotland and a steady march towards a reunied Ireland bolstered by the limited border down the Irish Sea. Wales - which backed Brexit - is more integrated with England than the other “celtic” nations. nButScotland goes it alone and prospers then Wales could want to follow a similar path. n Brexit Day news and explained  n The UK is now legally out of the EU and can no longer “cancel” Brexit by revoking Article . UK citizens will cease to be citizens of the EU.  nIf we want to rejoin the EU in future, it will be under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty, a y process that needs the approval of all  states. It would also require us to join the Euro. n\",\"usage\":,\"language\":\"en\",\"semantic_roles\":[,\"action\":,\"text\":\"will

That historic decision back in June  has ided the nation and will be greeted by a mixture of joy, sadness and relief - but also uncertainty. What does our departure actually mean for our economy, our laws and our place on the world stage  How - and when - will the biggest constitutional change in half a century impact on the lives of you and your loved ones Here we take a look at what Brexit means for you:What has changed   Not much. Although this is the legal moment the UK becomes the first nation ever to leave the EU, in practical terms you’ll notice very little dference. That’s because we are in a ‘transition period’ until the end of the year during which the UK will continue to follow EU rules - although we won’t have any say in them as British MEPs have lost their jobs and the UK won’t attend any more summits. It will also keep paying into the EU’s budget. Blue passports stripped of EU branding will start being issued to all new applicants, instead of the old burgundy ones, and m special p coins will enter circulation.  The UK can now formally begin trade talks with other countries, like the US and Australia, so they are ready to kick in at the end of the year. The Government will be hoping for some quick wins so it can show it is making a success of Brexit. A new team within No , headed by the PM’s chief Europe adviser David Frost, will lead the UK’s trade talks with the EU, our biggest trading partner. They’re only expected to get going properly in March after the EU agrees its negotiating “mandate” - and many believe they won’t be finished on time. Can the transition period be extended  The Brexit deal says the transition period can go on for another two years - until the end of . But the government passed a law banning any extension to show how serious it is about leaving. But it can still change its mind right up to the end of June. Beyond that, the  December becomes a hard deadline. We will continue to follow EU rules for the rest of the year and start paying our £bn ‘orce bill’ to the EU which stretch for several years.  The Government hopes so as they were touted as one of the biggest benefits of Brexit, but they have very little time. Any deals with other countries are likely to require controversial trade-offs, such as any agreement with the US over food standards and the NHS. EU officials are sceptical we’ll be able to strike a deal within the year. If we do, there will be a new set of rules from  January . If not, we could crash out on ‘WTO terms’ - the basic rules that slap high tarfs and restrictions on trade. What will Boris Johnson do next  No is desperate to move on from Brexit and to focus on domestic policy. The PM will have a big Cabinet reshuffle and is expected to make a string of announcements that benefit new Tory constituencies in the Midlands and North. He won his election victory on a promise of “levelling up” the British economy with greater investment into areas devastated by a decade of Tory austerity. But with tough trade talks and another looming deadline, Brexit isn’t going away, eventhe PM has restricted parliamentary scrutiny of the next phase.  Will our economy be stronger after Brexit   The full consequences of Brexit are uncertain. Much depends on whether we get a trade deal with the EU. Without one, the UK will “fall out” onto damaging WTO terms. EvenMr Johnson manages to strike a Canada-style agreement with the EU, the Treasury’s own forecasts estimate that Britain’s economy would be .% smaller - more than £bn a year - after  years than it would bewe’d stayed in the EU. The Government claims the economy could be boosted by trade deals with other countries - but the long-promised “Brexit idend” looks unlikely.  And what about our place on the world stage  Mr Johnson has promised post-Brexit Britain will be an outward-looking global power, building on relationships with old Commonwealth allies and newer “Five Eyes” security partners. By leaving the EU we may have more freedom, but we will also have markedly less clout in a world where the three major global hubs are the US, China and the EU.For decades Britain saw itself as a bridge between Europe and the US - but with Brexit and Donald Trump those relationships are under strain.And while we remain a major global economy, our departure from the single market makes us less attractive to many foreign investors. If the UK splinters after Brexit, with Scotland going it alone, it could put at risk its right to a seat on the United Nations Security Council. Will I still be able to travel to Europe   UK nationals will still be able to live, work and drive in the EU as they do now until the end of the transition. Future travel restrictions will be hammered out over the next  months. You won’t need a visa from  January you’re a tourist. But British citizens will no longer be able to spend more than three months in the EU without applying for a work or study visa. You may also need to show aticket, that you have enough money for your stay, and stop using EU passport lanes at European borders. The UK will bring in its own immigration system to control EU migration from the end of the year - though the Government always had the option of reducing immigration from outside the EU, but chose not to for economic reasons.  WhatI fall ill on holiday   You will be able to continue getting treatment in EU hospitals as you do now until the end of the transition period. After that, the European Health Insurance Card , which gives Brits access to EU healthcare in an emergency, will no longer work. There will not be one EU-wide regime on healthcare so it is up to the UK to strike “reciprocal” health cover with inidual states. A pact with Spain - home to , British expats - is likely to be among the first agreed. Butno deals to look after each others’ citizens are struck, British travellers will require adequate health insurance, while EU migrants here will be charged £ a year to use the NHS.  What will happen to EU citizens  EU citizens can continue arriving freely in the UK to live and work until  December . But they must apply by June  for “settled status”, which gives them the right to stay in the UK. Those who haven’t lived in the UK for five continuous years have to apply twice - first for “pre-settled status”, then again for settled status when the hit the five-year mark. After the transition period, new EU migrants will be subject to a points-based immigration system. They will have to prove their skills and probably earn a minimum salary.  Will I still get my workersapos rights  The Government will set its own workers’ rights after the transition with many fearing they will be watered down - or dropped entirely. Currently the EU has limits on night work and requirements for daily and weekly rest breaks. It also sets a -hour limit on the working week while giving employees the right to four weeks’ paid annual leave, plus bank holidays. Some expect anti-age discrimination measures to be removed - meaning there will be little or no protection for younger or older workers. Agency workers could be stripped of their right to equal treatment as permanent staff. Ministers have said they will continue maternity rights but there are no guarantees.  What  changes for me from January    You will no longer be guaranteed free mobile phone roaming in the EU as the issue will be left to operators. Duty free willon flights and boats to the EU. But there are likely to be some checks on lorries and vehicles crossing the Channel that could lead to delays. There will also be new checks on goods crossing between Britain and Northern Ireland under the terms of the Irish backstop. You may also need an international driving permit as well as a ‘green cardapos to prove you have the right car insurance and a GB bumper sticker. Pet owners can carry on bringing their animals to the EU on ‘pet passports’ until December, but after will need to obtain a health certicate. The Supreme Court will be the highest court of appeal in the UK and there will be no direct role for the European Court of Justice in British le.  Is the Union under threat  Boris Johnson has spoken about the “awesome foursome” of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.But Brexit may be the catalyst which breaks up the country, with nationalist sentiment on the rise in Scotland and a steady march towards a reunied Ireland bolstered by the limited border down the Irish Sea. Wales - which backed Brexit - is more integrated with England than the other “celtic” nations. ButScotland goes it alone and prospers then Wales could want to follow a similar path.

I decided against getting smashed in front of the TV watching Johnson’s Churchillian B-Day speech, although I stuck a tenner on him saying “we’ll kick them off the beaches”. I didn’t get down to the Parliament Square gloat-fest to hear everyone do a Vera Lynn as it looked a bit Eartha Kitt. And I wasn’t invited to the anti-elitist Vote Leave celebration in venture capitalist Jon Moynihan’s £million Cha mansion, so I missed Jacob Rees-Mogg dressed as Prince singing “tonight one’s going to party like it’s ”. I just sat at home, making bonging noises with the cat’s litter tray at pm, thinking of the future. And I decided to embrace it. That’s right. No more Brexit angst from me. No more remoaning. It’s time to move on. So as I wrap myself in my Got Brexit Done tea towel, let me raise a glass of Wetherspoon’s Sparkling White Clfs of Dover wine, and point out all the reasons we have to be cheerful now we’ve left the EU. Homeless beggars will get a boost as half the country refuses to have the new Brexit coin in their pocket and tosses it to them. The epidemic of coffee-fuelled halitosis in workplaces will be wiped out as Eastern European baristas go home and the obesity crisis will be addressed as people refuse to feed their kids President Slander’s ­Chlorinated Fried Chicken.

couple stranded in Mexico after flight home erted due to fight on boardEXCLUSIVE: Rachael and Mark Pocock are furious at TUI for sending no information to them for hours while stranded in Mexico

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA British couple are stranded in Mexico with their two-year-old child back at home - after their flight was erted when a passenger was arrested. Rachael and Mark Pocock were due to fly back from San Jose Del Cabo yesterday but claim the bus arranged to collect them from their hotel at midday never arrived. They claim they received no word from flight operator TUI for three hours, with their flight scheduled at .pm. The couple, and the eight others waiting for the transport, turned to Google and found that their flight, coming in from Gatwick, had had to land in Winnipeg Airport in Canada.The airport authority has confirmed a man was taken away by police on Thursday after Flight BY had to land there at .am local time. Manitoba RCMP said they were called to the scene due to an unruly passenger - with a fight understood to have broken out in the air - and as a result, the flight due to pick up Rachael and Mark never arrived. The Pococks are desperate to get home to their baby Amelie while Rachael, , had also organised a surprise th party for her husband with family flying in from the US and is very concerned we wonapost get to it. The couple, from just outside Nottingham, have been rehoused in a room at hotel Sandos Finesterra with a couple of strangers as they wait to come home.  Weaposre making the best of it, but we heard nothing at all from TUI for hours - itaposs disgraceful. Itaposs hot and everyoneaposs very anxious. Hopefully a bus will collect us tomorrow, said Rachael. Itaposs all quite distressing when itaposs supposed to be a luxury holiday - weaposve got our two year old at home with our parents. Thataposs our main concern is getting home. Referring to the two women who they are sharing with she said: We donapost know them and they donapost know us. We are not complaining about the hotel because the staff have been brilliant. But TUI should be ashamed. She became concerned because she understands there are very few international flights from Cabo. She claims the holiday already got pushed back at the last minute by TUI, as they were originally due to come home on January  giving them several days before the surprise party in Cambridge, where Mark is from. When their bus did not arrive this morning, Rachael and Mark, who are the only Brits staying at the hotel, began to panic with their flight leaving in a few hours.  The hotel did not know what was going on, she claimed. Itaposs so hot and everyoneaposs sat around in their best clothes not knowing whataposs going on. Rachael eventually got an automated text message from TUI around pm which confirmed their fears that the plane was delayed until the following day due to an incident on the board the flight, causing it to ert. It explained that they would be able to stay an extra night at the hotel, with the flight now due to leave at pm on Friday. Rachael then emailed the TUI holiday rep who did not respond until around pm, apologising for the delay. We’ve been working throughout the day to ensure that everyone has rooms for the night and I thank you for your patience, the rep said. I was in touch with the hotel director and her team throughout the day and hopefully they relayed my messages to you to keep you informed. There was a major incident with a guest onboard the LGW flight today which resulted in the flight being erted to Canada. It was originally scheduled to arrive back in Mexico this afternoon but at the last minute was delayed further and will now be arriving tomorrow around am.

Shoppers had rushed to stock up on the anti-bacterial spray after labels claimed the product could kill the human coronavirus - but scientists have warned that it has no evidence.Amazed shoppers claimed they aposhave found a cureapos of the deadly Wuhan virus as they shared images of the cleaning agent on Twitter.The label at the back of the bottle shows: Dettol Anti-Bacterial Surface Cleanser is proven to kill viruses: Influenza - Type A HN, Human Coronavirus and RSV. Some were shocked to the finding as one said: How did they know this before the outbreak   But experts explained that the term aposcoronavirusapos can be attributed to a group of RNA viruses and the recent outbreak is being referred as the Wuhan-strain, according to Plymouth Live.Dr Jonathan Stoye, head of ision of virology, The Francis Crick Institute, states the common cold can also fall under the Coronavirus category, which is most likely what the Dettol labels are referring to, not the fatal Wuhan strain. So perhaps is not the time to start loading up fast on cheap domestic sprays at the supermarket - Dettol in particular.  “It should be made clear that the Wuhan virus is only one of many types of human coronavirus – another is associated with many common colds, Dr Stoye said. Presumably, the cold virus has been tested for sensitivity to Dettol.” Professor Jonathon Ball, professor of molecular virology, University of Nottingham said: “There are lots of viruses, coronaviruses included, that contain an outer layer made of oils – or lipids to give them their correct term – and this layer is sensitive to the actions of lots of commonly used disinfectants, including soap.  “Whilst these disinfectants would not have been tested directly against the novel coronavirus, the virus will have the same kind of lipids in their outer surface, which can be removed by commonly used disinfectants and soaps. “This is well known and not new.”An expert in disease control at Exeter University said that the coronavirus outbreak should be a matter of concern but not worry or panic for people in the South West. Dr Bharat Pankhania said at all times, not only during outbreaks, good hand hygiene went a long way towards control and reduction in person-to-person spread of infections. “I often observe people in public toilets not washing their hands or not washing and drying them properly. It is no wonder that we have outbreaks,” said Dr Pankhania, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter’s College of Medicine and Health. The virus, reportedly first spread in Wuhan of central China, has killed  people and infected over , people globally.

It was only when he phoned and asked where to send his application that his we realised who used to run the practice. The rookie doctor was stepping into the shoes of Dr Death. It was the surgery in Hyde run by Harold Shipman who murdered around  of his patients, making him the most prolic serial killer in history. The old mill town, seven miles from Manchester, was devastated by the evil doctor’s crimes. He worked and killed there from  until he was caught in , and every resident knew someone whose le had been cruelly cut short by Shipman. It was on January ,  –  years ago today, that he was convicted and jailed for le for murdering  of his patients. Dr Hannan arrived in Hyde nine months later, and was soon all too well aware of what he was letting himself in for. He says: “The day before I started, my we and I were watching TV and it came on the news – they were in  Market Street in Hyde and there were a whole load of elderly men and women all sat on the floor of the waiting room. They were angry, protesting that a new doctor was going to be foisted upon them. I just thought, ‘Oh my God – I am walking into a war zone’. “That gave me my first taste of what was going to come. I arrived to find that Shipman’s we had turned up the night before and taken the computer system away because it had been owned by Shipman.” Giving his new premises a thorough examination, like any good doctor, it was Dr Hannan’s heart which suddenly skipped a beat when he stumbled across the couch on which Shipman had murdered a number of his patients. He says: “There was a side room off the surgery that had the couch in it. He had put the patients in there, murdered them, shut the door and then carried on his consultations and nobody knew. So there I am on day one, I have no computer, and that couch had to go immediately.” Shipman hid in plain sight, murdering mostly elderly female patients. His killing method was injecting diamorphine, a pharmaceutical heroin. Born in Nottingham in , as a boy he was very close to his domineering mother Vera. Chillingly given his subsequent killing spree, he was fascinated by how morphine eased Vera’s pain when she was dying from lung cancer.  His mother died aged just  when Shipman was . Determined to become a doctor, he graduated from Leeds School of Medicine in , four years after marrying Primrose Oxtoby, with whom he would have four children. After finishing his training, he joined a practice in Todmorden, West Yorks. Shipman’s career almost came to an abrupt and early halt. He became addicted to the painkiller Pethidine and was caught forging prescriptions. He left the practice and entered drug rehab, hit with a fine and a conviction for forgery. But the General Medical Council decided no further action should be taken, as did the Home Office. Shipman was free toto the profession and in  secured a post at the Donneybrook practice in Hyde. He became known as a hardworking, honest GP and in , after more than a decade at Donneybrook, set out on his own, starting up the practice in Market Street.  He was followed by devoted patients, many of whom would later refuse to believe the man they thought of as a pillar of the community was an angel of death.  It was March  when it became apparent Shipman’s elderly patients were dying at a higher rate than expected and in very similar circumstances – usually fully clothed, sitting up in an armchair or reclining on a settee. Despite respected members of the community – a funeral director, a taxi driver and another GP, becoming suspicious, a preliminary police investigation said there was no cause for concern. Shipman’s records appeared to be in order and little wonder, for the doctor had carefully falsied them.  In the end the family GP would finally be snared by his own greed. In June ,  year-old former mayoress of Hyde Kathleen Grundy was discovered dead hours after Shipman visited, leaving relatives perplexed as she had appeared to be in good health. They were further alarmed when they discovered her will had been changed, leaving her whole estate, worth £,, to Shipman. The doctor insisted no autopsy was necessary but Kathleen’s daughter Angela Woodruff refused to accept Dr Shipman’s explanations. Her mother’s body was exhumed and a postmortem revealed she died from a morphine overdose administered within three hours of her death.  Matching the time frame in which Shipman had visited her, the doctor’s home was searched and medical records, a strange collection of jewellery and the typewriter used to forge the will were uncovered. Police soon learned the calculating killer had urged many families to get their loved ones cremated to hide his crimes, produced falsied medical notes when questions were raised – and even pretended to call the emergency services in front of relatives only to “cancel” the ambulance after he pronounced the patient dead. Shipman went on trial at Preston crown court charged with  counts of murder and one count of forgery and was found guilty on all charges.  The disgraced doctor was given a whole le sentence and four years later, he hung himself at Wakefield Prison, aged . He remains the only British doctor ever to be found guilty of murdering his patients. The subsequent Shipman Inquiry looked into how he had got away with killing for so long, and why he had done it. But in the end its chair Dame Janet Smith said: “I think Shipman’s crimes were without motive. “The psychiatrists warn me that it is possible that, in Shipman’s own mind, there was a conscious motivation. All I can say is that there is no evidence of any of the features that I have observed, in my experience as a judge, that motivate murderers.”  What is clear is that Shipman’s killing spree shattered trust among his patients in Hyde – which Dr Hannan has been rebuilding. The -year-old GP says: “When the story first broke it was complete disbelief. People said no, you go to your doctor for him to help you, not for him to murder you. “This is a deprived area. People here die  years earlier than the national average which is one of the reasons nobody picked up on the excess deaths. It was almost, what do you expect  You live in Hyde. “It might not be talked about on the news any more, but it is still very vivid in people’s minds and it causes distress and mental health problems. I am still dealing with the fallout of Shipman to this very day. It doesn’t go away.” Ingrid Brindle was one of Shipman’s patients. “I thought he was an excellent doctor because I had a long-term medical condition and he gave me everything I needed,” she says. “I really thought he was excellent and so did a lot of other people.” It was important for Dr Hannan to regain the trust of his patients. It was one simple act which changed everything. He said: “I remember about three years into the job I was talking to a patient during a consultation and just turned my computer screen round so they could see what I was typing. As I turned that screen around there was a flicker of a smile I had never seen before.” From then on Dr Hannan, who has moved to the new Haughton Thornley Medical Centre in the town, gave every patient access to their medical records, and ensured that they understood them. He says: “It’s possible Shipman convinced his victims, ‘Well, you’ve got heart disease so that is why I am giving you this morphine’. And they just went along with it, because why would you question a doctor ” "},{"url":null,"title":"half items bought sales waste","story":"w.mantis  Half of items bought in sales are waste of money -

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum-of-three says she has been left exhausted over noise from a construction site near her house which she claims has kept her awake night after night. The furious mum claims she has not enjoyed a full nightaposs sleep for more than half a year due to noise coming from the site in Rockbeare, East Devon. Jenner Coleridge claims not only is there considerable noise during the day from the Taylor Wimpey site, but that a generator is left on next to her home overnight which prevents her and her family from sleeping properly due to the noise and vibrations it creates. She claims the daily noise includes a fleet of lorries turning up to take soil away at .am, and drilling beginning at am.Her partner, Jonathan, works nights while she also has three daughters aged ,  and six, reports Devon Live.Jenner - who bought the house in  - says the problem is so severe that they are considering renting a property where until the noise subsides. I wish I had never bought the bloody house, she said. It has been a nightmare. I haven’t had a decent night’s sleep for months. I have been trying since June last year. I have lorries turning up on site, builders on machinery with lights flashing and alarms going off. Guys turn up on site and leave their engines on. I also have a generator going on all night. There is a little outbuilding outside my bedroom and I don’t knowit that one has the generator inside or not but it is horrible. We are considering renting somewhere but that is ridiculous as we would be paying for two homes when it is them making the noise. Jenner, who has jobs as both an area manager for a cleaning company and as a cleaner, is so frustrated at the situation that she has complained to both Taylor Wimpey, who are building the houses at the site, and the council. But things have got so bad that she even emailed her MP in the hope of finding a solution. I have spoken to environmental health and they have done their bit by going on site and emailing them too but it only makes a dference for a day or two, she continued. I was trying to get to sleep but couldn’t, so I sent an email at .am saying I was lying in bed unable to sleep with my head under a pillow. I have spoken to my local MP too. I am at my wit’s end.  We couldnapost use the garden in the summer, we couldn’t hang the washing up, Jenner continued. The work was expected but they shouldn’t be starting work until am so I feel they are breaking the rules and regulations. There is an outbuilding that looks like a brick shed too outside my house. We should not be hearing anything from it but we can hear it and feel vibrations too. It is affecting my sleep and well-being. East Devon District Council confirmed that they had been contacted by Jenner over the issue. The council said that it was putting pressure on Taylor Wimpey to find a solution. Officers in the Environmental Health team have been helping this resident with a number of concerns over the last six months, said a council spokesperson. As a result, the procedures used by Taylor Wimpey have improved and they are compliant with the requirements of the East Devon DC Construction Sites Code of Practice. Recently quite a bit of infrastructure work has taken place very close to this resident and they do appreciate that some noise during the day is inevitable.

The nine-year-old was reported missing by her mum Karen Matthews almost  years ago in February , sparking the biggest manhunt since the search for the Yorkshire Ripper. While detectives feared she had been kidnapped and desperately appealed for information about her whereabouts, Shannon was in fact cooped up in a bedroom less than a mile from her Dewsbury home.

The list of rules warned her that she must stay hidden - even limiting how loud she could turn up the TV. The heartbreaking note reads: Rules. You must not make any noise or bang your feet. You must not go near the windows. You must not get anything or do anything without me been here .  Keep the TV volumeonly up to  or lower. You can play the Super Mario games and you can play some DVDs and you can play the CD music.

The scruffy bedroom containing cheap wooden furniture was the former sleeping area for Donovanaposs two daughters who were taken into care before the kidnap. An electronic keyboard and, bizarrely, a glue gun were found on top of a metal framed double bunk.

Near a smoke alarm case there is a copy of Arrive Alive, a colourful highway code book for youngsters. Matthews, , had hoped to cash in on a £, reward for her daughter, but was jailed in  when her plot was foiled. Police described Matthews as “pure evil” after she was found guilty of kidnap,  ­imprisonment and perverting the course of justice.

The  minute Channel  show, called Thomas Markle: My Story, aired last week and made headlines around the world. Retired lighting director, Mr Markle, , invited a film crew into his home in Rosarito, Mexico, last year in a bid to tell his side of his complicated relationship with Meghan, . He laid bare how he has not spoken to his daughter since her wedding to Prince Harry at Windsor Castle in May , nor has he met his grandson Archie. And blink and you may have missed it, but in one scene a book can be seen placed on his coffee table that may raise a few eyebrows.The publication is by none other than Piers Morgan and is called The Insider: The Private Diaries of a Scandalous Decade. It details the Good Morning Britain hostaposs time working as a newspaper editor at the News of the World and the Daily Mirror. It also goes into great detail about Piersapos meetings with Harryaposs mother, Prince Diana, among other royals and famous faces. Piers has been an outspoken critic of Meghan since she began dated Harry. After Meghan and Harry recently announced they would be stepping back as senior royals, Piers tweeted: BREAKING: The Queen’s told Megan Harry to sling their part-time royal hook. Well done, Your Majesty - right decision. Only surprised it took her so long to get Harry to ditch his family, the Monarchy, the military and his country. What a piece of work. Bottom line: Meghan Harry wanted to have their cake  eat it, but the Queen just took the cake back to the royal kitchens.  Meanwhile, speaking on the documentary, Mr Markle said he was taking part so he could talk directly to his daughter after being apossnubbedapos for the past two years. He is filmed discussing the Sussexes and what led to their bitter estrangement in the run-up to her wedding. Fearing he will never get to see Meghan again or meet his grandson, the pensioner said: The last time they might see me is being lowered into the ground. I donapost think at this point they are thrilled to see me or want to talk to me.”  Mr Markle also spoke about missing Meghanaposs wedding due to heart complications. Addressing Meghan directly, he said: I apologise to you. I want to apologise to the queen and to the royal family. I want to do that, and I was told by them, aposdonapostapos. “And I was scheduled to go to the airport and go fly to England because they still wanted me to come to the wedding and be at the wedding.And at that time I got a massive heart attack and was then taken to the Sharp hospital, across the border.”Speaking about their decision to step back from their royal duties and move to Canada with Archie, he added: With Meghan and Harry separating from the royals, itaposs disappointing because she actually got every girlaposs dream. Every young girl wanted to become a princess, and she got that, and now sheaposs tossing that away, for it looks like sheaposs tossing it away for money. Apparently million and a -bedroom home isnapost enough for them. When they got married, they took on an obligation, and the obligation is to be part of the Royals and to represent the Royals, and it would be foolish for them not to.

At pm last night we waved goodbye to our -year membership of the EU. Many will embark on this uncertain journey with optimism, others with trepidation, but everyone realises this is a decisive moment. The immediate task is to secure a new trade deal with the European Union which protects jobs and business. There must be no undermining of environmental and consumer protections or chipping away at hard-won workers’ rights. We also need to strike new trade agreements with dozens of other countries including the United States, Australia, India and Japan. In this instance no-deal would be better than a bad dealit meant giving US firms access to the NHS or allowed America to export its chlorinated chicken and hormone-pumped beef to these shores. Having “taken back control”, Boris Johnson’s Government must build a fairer Britain which spreads wealth more evenly and leaves no area of Britain behind. The “levelling up” he promises would not be necessarythe Conservatives had not waged a war of austerity which has hollowed out communities and starved vital services. Mr Johnson claims this is a moment to improve lives in every corner of the UK. The Mirror will be watching to make sure the Prime Minister makes good on his word.  Trust the NHS THE coronavirus came to our shores yesterday with the confirmation that two people have tested positive for the ­potentially deadly virus. This will be an anxious time for the patients and the  Britons in quarantine after being flown back from Wuhan yesterday.

There is no suggestion that I personally falsied this email.“The suggestion is that I forwarded the email after it had been falsied by someone .“I refute the allegations made against me and I can confirm I will be appealing against my removal from my post.Mr Christie also said he felt that the penalty seemed to be “disproportionate” to the accusations made against him.“No other allegations have been made against me,” he said.“I have worked in my current role for  years and have had an association with the council for  years.“I continue to have a huge respect for my council colleagues, council officers and elected members.“This is a very unfortunate time for me and I will need to take time to look at things moving forward.“I don’t wish to say anything further at this stage but will be making my intentions clear in due course.”Blue Parrot had provided sound equipment for DSMT for previous shows.DSMT producer and manager Lina Waghorn said: “I am shocked and saddened that Kenny Christie is no longer working with the council.“He was a great asset to DSMT and an inspirational teacher.”It’s understood students at DSMT were informed on Sunday January  that Mr Christie was “moving on to new projects”.It was made clear to students he was not ing and that Kris Mordente, a St John’s Academy teacher, would be taking over director permanently.A source at DSMT said: “It’s just a bit strange that he’s gone. Kenny was DSMT and DSMT was Kenny. I don’t think anyone knows how we’re going to operate without him.“He had been growing distant for a while, we have only seen him three times since August and at one point Lina mentioned bringing in an assistant director.“It’s not something we’d expect, I think everyone here including Lina would be reluctant to let him go.”A Blue Parrot spokesman said the company was not awarded the DSMT contract because “strictly speaking, we did not meet the deadline.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We do not comment on inidual personnel matters.”Kenny Christie has been described as one of the most “sought-after” musical theatre directors in the country.He has worked with DSMT for over  years, producing several musicals like Les Miserables and Annie.His directing career began at the age of , producing a one-act play as part of the SCDA drama festival.In , Mr Christie became the world record holder for the fastest theatrical production, taking one piece from book to stage in just . hours.He has also taught and organised dance workshops ,in Dundee and Perth, and has worked with Dundee City Council to organise dance activities for school pupils.Mr Christie has also held the title of chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, as well as being the first Youth Adviser for Scotland for the National Operatic and Dramatic Association.Kenny Christie’s sacking comes in the wake of a separate fraud scandal that has rocked Dundee City Council in the past year.In October, the council’s head of construction Mark Ross quit in the midst of an investigation into claims he was treated to a golfing trip on the Spanish coast by bosses of a firm awarded an £ million local authority contract.The £.m deal to provide heat and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors was awarded to Edmundson Electrical without going out to tender.The trip to Spain took place weeks after the contract was awarded and included Mr Ross, a senior Edmundson staff member, another council employee and representatives of two other firms.It was later revealed that the second council employee was Kenny Muir, who also worked in the council’s construction department.He was sacked from his role earlier this month.Mr Muir is the fourth senior employee to leave construction services since September, following the resignations of Mr Ross and electrical supervisor Iain Gardyne, who is accused of selling thousands of pounds’ worth of council smoke alarms online."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/DNic_John_Wilkie_Spiders_Snake-15.jpg ","title":"forfars very own spider man unveils creepy crawly collection including 36 spiders","story":"While living with dozens of spiders, scorpions and massive snakes may seem like a living nightmare for some people, it#s all in a day#s work for one local animal enthusiast.Delivery driver John Wilkie has been keeping snakes and lizards since he was in school, and five years ago he fell in love with keeping spiders as pets.The father of two now has a collection of more than  arachnids, including ins tarantulas, which he keeps in a small annex outside of his cottage in Forfar.He said: #I started seeing my friends posting pictures of their tarantulas online five years ago, and I was just stunned by some of the colours.#I decided to go for it myself and bought my first tarantula.#It#s just something a bit dferent and interesting. I#ve always liked them.#John#s collection also includes two lizards, a scorpion and four snakes, one of which is an ft boa constrictor. vw, px\"  He understands that some people may find the eight-legged critters off-putting, however he still believes that they can make good pets.He said: #It#s one of these things which people have this sort of built-in fear of, I think we get it from our parents.#There#s still some types of spider which people can find quite cute, like the jumping spider. vw, px\"  #My we hates spiders, which is why they have to stay outside of the house, but she does find the jumping spiders quite cute.#The animal enthusiast is also used to people being sceptical of his hobby.He added: #Usually people just askI#ve been bitten or what I#d doa spider escapes. vw, px\"  #Most of the negative comments are about the snakes. People always bring up that old myth about a snake lying itself flat next to a woman at night in a plan to eat her.#There are currently no venomous creatures in John#s collection, and while he#s been bitten by snakes before, he claims that he#s never had so much as a nip from a spider.In  and , the lorry driver took a break from his day job delivering stationary and travelled to Australia with a team of scientists to film and photograph snakes and spiders.During the trip John was credited as part of a team which discovered a new species of jumping spider, which has been used in schools around Australia to help fight the stigma around the web-slinging bugs."},{"url":null,"title":"majority of dee squad havent done enough squad slammed by paul mcgowan","story":"“Probably only two, maybe three players, can look in the mirror and say they have done enough this season. That’s being kind. The rest, including myself, haven’t been good enough.”That’s the brutal assessment of Dundee’s season from experienced midfielder Paul McGowan.The Dark Blues are in doubt of even achieving a play-off place in the Championship after picking up just eight points from their last nine league fixtures.In that time, rivals and league leaders Dundee United have raced away at the top of the ision and sit a massive  points ahead of the Dens Park club.As the campaign heads into the business end, Dundee are searching for a spark to finally ignite their season.And McGowan insists that has to come tomorrow when they head to Morton.He told the Tele: “It’s been really disappointing recently, we’ve not been good enough.“People have a go at us for saying the same stuff but it really hasn’t been good enough.“You can see we are lacking in confidence, we are gting teams goals and not scoring.“We need to get back to basics, get back to being hard to beat and stop gting teams goals, giving head-starts and then get a run going.“Our confidence isn’t high at the moment after the results we’ve had.“We need that one result to turn it in the other direction.“We’ve found ourselves in a sticky moment but we need to start dominating games and asserting ourselves.“I’m bored even saying these things, it’s getting so old.“We have to speak to the press and say what we have to say but we need to start doing it on the pitch.“As a squad we are not doing enough.“Probably only two, maybe three players can look in the mirror and say they have done enough.“That’s being kind.“The rest, including myself, have not been good enough.“What can you say  It’s not been great.“We are letting ourselves down, letting the manager down and letting the fans down.“That’s the way it has went but we still have a chance to get up through the play-offs.“That’s the best way, we’ll keep going in the league but United are too far in front, I won’t lie about that.“We need to start playing and winning games.”Cappielow is by no means the easiest place to turn your form around.David Hopkin’s Ton have picked up  points from their last five Championship matches and were minutes away from beating Dundee United at Tannadice last weekend.And Dundee’s last trip to Greenock should serve as a big reminder of the dangers they pose. vw, px\"  Peter Grant’s header just before half-time was enough for the Greenock side to seal a - victory back in September.“The last game down there, there was nothing in it. We gave away a silly free-kick and they scored from that and held out,” added McGowan.“They make things hard, go very direct and make it a horrible game. Credit to them, they have picked up some good results and nearly beat United at Tannadice last week.“We know what to expect and we have to be up for it.“That’s what they do, they go a goal up and make it hard, work their socks off all over the pitch and have players that can hurt you.“It will be a hard game at Cappielow so we’ll have to be at our best to get anything.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"united enforcer calum butcher urges winning run to seal promotion","story":"It’s in our hands, now let’s go get the title.That’s the message from Dundee United midfielder Calum Butcher.The Terrors welcome Arbroath to Tannadice tomorrow, sitting  points clear at the top of the Championship table.It looks a case of when notUnited will seal the deal and end their four-year absence from the Premiership.With glory so tantalisingly close with only  games remaining, Butcher is keen for United to kick on and wrap things up as soon as possible.Despite already smashing their targets until this point, the best way to do that, according to the -year-old, is get back to winning ways after a cup exit at the hands of Hibs and a draw with Morton in the past week.“We split the quarters and we knew at the start of the season to achieve promotion what kind of targets we needed to hit,” he said.“On the run we’re on we have exceeded that a little bit but we know there’s  games left and we have to win the majority of those to make sure we go up.“It’s in our hands and we know,we go out and perform like we can, we’ll do that.“I don’t think there’s any complacency, no one has got above their station and everyone is working for the team.“For us to achieve promotion, we need to stick together. There’ll be dips along the way, like Tuesday night, but we need to bounce back tomorrow.”First up for United is the challenge of Dick Campbell’s Red Lichties tomorrow afternoon.The teams have played out two tight games this season with United coming out on top by one goal on both occasions.However, a scrap wouldn’t bother Butch, so long as they pick up those all important three points.“They’re a dficult side to play against as we’ve seen, home and away,” he added.“It was tough at their place because of the conditions but the onus will be on us at home. It’s a dferent game.“Last week was dficult against Morton. They had something to hold on to but we did really well to come back into the game in the last minute.“It was a big point for us.“It was, obviously, very disappointing to go out on Tuesday night but, ultimately, it’s about the league and promotion.“It was a strange feeling to lose on Tuesday after such a long period without losing a game, so that’s something we’ve got to deal with. I think, personally and for the boys in the dressing-room, we were looking forward to tomorrow straight away just to get back out there and win a game again.“We’ve dusted ourselves off and we’re ready to go tomorrow.”A lot has been made of the rumours surrounding Lawrence Shankland’s future at the Tangerines as the January transfer window gets set to slam shut at midnight.However, Butcher insists the noise around their star man has had little affect on Shanks or the squad.“Lawrence is a great guy and since he’s come here, from day one, he’s got on with it.“He knew that he had to score goals and he’s done that. He’s been absolutely fantastic for us.“He deals with everything great. He’s not big time about it at all and doesn’t take things too far in terms of getting too high or too low.“It’s great for him but I think there’s a lot of boys in the dressing-room there’ll be speculation about because the side’s doing so well.“It’s something we’re having to deal with now and probably in the summer. It’s just one of those things but I think, at the moment, everyone is happy with how things are going.“Lawrence being here after the window is great. He’s got no ego, works hard for the team and wants to do well for us and himself.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"memories-marlene-glasgow-messages-mum","story":"WHEN he was a wee boy, growing up in Townhead, Bill Henderson loved a visit to Lewisrsquos department store."},{"url":null,"title":"influence-friars-glasgow-bishop-wisharts-arrival","story":"As we have begun to see, it is impossible to understate the importance of the Christian Church to the development of Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"sad-day-city-favourite-closed-doors","story":"WHEN Dinorsquos Italian restaurant closed its doors, it was a sad day for many Glasgow Times readers."},{"url":null,"title":"screechy-boards-steamed-pudding-kelvinside-academy-memories","story":"GUY ROBERTSON, AD AGENCY BOSS"},{"url":null,"title":"tribute-planned-glasgow-schoolgirl","story":"A GLASGOW school is planning a tribute for an -year-old pupil who died after suffering an acute asthma attack."},{"url":null,"title":"east-renfrewshire-councils-consultants-recommend-turning-eastwood-park-allotments-car-park","story":"COUNCIL bosses have been looking at plans that would rip up a thriving allotment site... and replace it with a car park."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-singer-holly-scally-set-appear-voice-uk","story":"A SCHOOLGIRL is hoping her vocals will impress when she appears on the hit ITVreality show The Voice."},{"url":null,"title":"kris-ajer-roasts-celtic-teammate-jonny-hayes---claiming-cant-understand","story":"Kris Ajer has had a light-hearted pop at teammate Jonny Hayes - claiming he cant understand the Irishman."},{"url":null,"title":"brazil-world-cup-runner-up-cesar-sampaio-rafael-scheidt-flopped-celtic","story":"Rafael Scheidt will forever be known as a Celtic flop.

Dyce Railway Station into a new car park have been lodged with Aberdeen City Council.The plot of land on Farburn Terrace has lain vacant for several years, and has been used as an unofficial car park by numerous vehicles over that period.Now, a planning application has been submitted to the council by Ken Mathieson Architectural Design Ltd on behalf of applicants Fleet Investments Ltd.The site is split into two sections, one lower and one higher, which would be sectioned off from each other with new landscaping under the proposals.According to drawings, there would be  spaces in the upper site, including six disabled spaces, and  spaces on the lower side, with three disabled spaces.The site is connected to Dyce Railway Station via a footpath, and it is anticipated the car park may be used by those visiting the station, including cars that are left by offshore workers for several weeks.A statement submitted alongside the application states: “The proposal has developed from the applicant’s desire to achieve best use of the ground area without any ground contouring and maximising the number of parking spaces.“The most important feature in the consideration of the proposal was how the proposed temporary use of the site could maximise its usage while ensuring that it could be removed easily and economically should market conditions change.“Given the surrounding uses, hotel and car parks to the south, industrial units and car parking to the west and residential to the north, it was considered a good use of vacant land.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/02/2.32347657-240x180.jpg

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Their health suffers and the prospect of developing economically remains out of reach. For women and young girls, the consequences can be even worse, with many being attacked and raped when they use outdoor spaces. Girls are also removed from school when they reach puberty because of the lack of safe facilities.Through Toilet Twinning, it costs £ to build a toilet for an inidual family and £ to provide a block of toilets for a school or a displaced peoples camp.To raise vital funds, the group will host a coffee morning at Ardrishaig Parish Church Hall on Saturday January  and invites everyone to go along as it #helps to change the world, one toilet at a time#."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor january 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,in  The Argyllshire Advertiser ran a story entitled #Skate park pipe dream a reality for Lochgilphead#. Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"karen-flies-flag-outdoor-film-festival","story":"FEATURING a Paralympic gold medallist, World Record holders, a star of BBC natural history programmes, two hugely respected Polar guides and a breath-taking selection of more than  films from around the world, this yearrsquos Peebles Outdoor Film Festival promises a feast of entertainment.Starting on Friday , the festival opens with four action-packed sessions - a screening of favourite films from previous years, a taster session with a wonderful programme of brand new films, an appearance by father and son endurance cyclists Rich and Tom Seipp, and ending with a session of short films exploring wild places on our doorstep alongside a headline appearance by ing and natural history presenter Miranda Krestovnikoff.Programme director Rich Rowe said: ldquoItrsquos a wonderful start to the festival and really sets the tone for an exhilarating weekend.\"This year, we are delighted to also welcome Paralympic champion and hand cycling adventurer Karen Darke ndash someone whom wersquove tried to have at the festival for several years now but whose schedule has always been so busy.Now based in Inverness, but a well-known figure locally following her regular rides in the annual Tour Orsquo the Borders, Karenrsquos story is a remarkable one.Paralysed from a young age following a climbing accident, Karenrsquos love of cycling ndash and the freedom it gives ndash has opened a whole new world of possibilities.In a blog for FINDRA Clothing, the sponsor of Karenrsquos session, she revealed: \"When things get tough in my head, I turn to my bike.\"And when things get tough in my body, I also turn to my bike.Karenrsquos talk will explore some of the many epic cycling adventures that she has experienced across the worldrsquos continents since winning hand cycling gold at the  Rio Paralympic Games.However, as she will point out, medals and globe-trotting only begin to touch on what cycling is all about for her.Karen explained: ldquoThe combination of movement and nature that cycling brings has certainly been the lsquodoctorrsquo of my le.ldquoFrom injury to wellness, from stressed to feeling free, from lonely to sharing deep experiences and connections, it never fails.

Douglas and Sons of Lilliesleaf, on Christmas Eve when Graham Douglas died .The Douglas family business was started at the end of the First World War by William Douglas, who had three sons Willie, Dan and Jimmy, who on leaving school in turn all joined the family business. Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub. Thankfully Bob Spearman is carrying on with the ldquoLilliesleaf Legends pigeon flock.Grahamrsquos greatest assets were that he was honest, thorough and reliable with great attention to detail in anything and all in which he was involved. He is survived by his we, Anne, two daughters, mother, his two brothers and his two sisters.Irreplaceable but not forgotten in Lilliesleaf, Kelso and the Borders, William Graham Douglas, his father Bill, his grandfather, Willie, and his great grandfather, William.Ron Wilson"},{"url":null,"title":"alleged-stalker-remanded-custody","story":"A -year-old man has been remanded in custody at Jedburgh Sherf Court after being accused of stalking a former partner.Vincent Cardle - who gave an address in Roxburghshire - made no plea during a private hearing and the case was continued for further examination.Bail was refused and he was remanded in custody and is due to appear in court again later this week."},{"url":null,"title":"douglas-crawford-announced-2020s-melrosian-elect","story":"LEADING as this years Melrosian-elect,is -year-old Douglas Crawford.Douglas, who is currently studying a Masters degree in Performance Psychology at the University of Edinburgh, was revealed as the new Melrosian at the annual Ex-Melrosian Burns Supper last weekend.Douglas told us: \"Im really excited, Im looking forward to the summer now.\"It was a really good night, the speakers were fantastic, last years Melrosian, Ben, spoke well.\"I had a lot of family there so it was really special to be announced.\"Douglas will join other members of his family, including his father, who have taken up the role of Melrosian in the past, which he said makes the honour \"even more special.\"He added: \"I and my family are so grateful for this opportunity.\"Im just looking forward to the festivities getting underway.\"The Corn Exchange played host to the sell-out evening on Saturday, January , celebrating the Bards birthday where guests were entertained by an outstanding lineup of speakers and entertainers.Stephen Amos gave the Immortal Memory and the Toast to the Lassies was made by Melrosian , Ben Magowan, which was matched by an excellent reply from Rev.

been calling for a station toto the village, on the East Coast Main Line, for more than  years.Currently, it is planned that the station will be open before , with campaigners calling for it to be in place as soon as possible.Now, a letter has been sent out to village residents highlighting upcoming work in the area.The letter reads: ldquoWe will shortly begin survey work and site investigation activity on railway land in your neighbourhood.ldquoThis work is required to help the design of a new station at East Linton.ldquoOur work will involve detailed survey activities, which may require us to cut back some vegetation.ldquoOur site investigation work also requires us to use drilling equipment to check ground conditions in proposed development sites.ldquoWhere possible, the work will be carried out during the day.ldquoHowever, some of our investigations need to be undertaken on the railway embankment or directly underneath the tracks.ldquoIn order to access these locations, we will need to carry out the work at night while trains are not operating.ldquoDuring this period of work, we will have a small compound located on site to provide facilities for our staff.ldquoThe compound will be set up from Saturday February  until our work is complete and will be located adjacent to the railway, with access taken through Orchardfield Estate, East Linton.The works come at the same

questions from Mr Gray, which he submitted in light of the decision to end the Abellio ScotRail contract three years early, indicated that Network Rail are progressing with the station designs with

developing plans for the December  East Coast Main Line timetable, including services for East Linton.Mr Gray was pleased progress was being made but vowed to keep the pressure on to ensure there were no delays.He said: ldquoFollowing the governmentrsquos decision to cut short Abelliorsquos ScotRail franchise, I asked parliamentary questions about progress on delivering East Lintonrsquos new rail

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

To turn the area over to commercial activities from November, with an unsightly and unpassable clear-up lasting from January to May, is to commandeer the place for more than half the year. Eight weeks would be acceptable  is not.Naturally, this eyesore wont be published on any VisitScotland website. Most sightseers wont ever catch a glimpse of this inglorious aftermath. Meanwhile, between now and the middle of May, those who live and work in Edinburgh must pass by and avert their gaze, wondering how their city became a mere pawn of the entertainment industry and not an illustrious capital of which they could once be proud. As one of many disgruntled locals tweeted, this is ruination \"in the name of greed\".I cannot think of a city of comparable elegance, venerability and wealth ndash a Unesco World Heritage Centre to boot ndash where the first thing you see as you emerge from the train station, or arrive from the airport is a wasteland. Welcome to Scotland! Here we dont roll out the red carpet, but ndash after an agonisingly long delay ndash we do renew the turf.Theres a palpable feeling at the moment that Edinburgh is undergoing seismic change, under our noses but without public consent. News last week that planning regulations could be relaxed to allow restaurants, cafes, and a host of other non-retail outfits to move into Princes Street is a fresh cause for concern. If approved, this new dispensation could mean that one of Europes most beguiling bouleds ndash the street that sells Scotland ndash could become home to a casino, cinema, or even a sports facility.Why should this concern us  Given the tawdry quality of some of the shops currently trading, wouldnt bright cafes or restaurants be a welcome improvement  After all, the array of tartan tat, cheap-as-chips fashion and even an emporium dedicated to sugary sweets ndash the smell alone could rot your teeth ndash is hardly in keeping with the magnicence of the venue.Yet given some of the poor decisions already taken by the councils planning committee, it is hard to feel confident that this incomparably lovely avenue is in safe hands. One member of the committee says the idea is to create a \"more authentic\" space. Im not sure what that means, but it sounds like double-speak for attracting lucrative footfall. And while pubs wont apparently be allowed onto the street, this relaxing of regulations extends to George Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Castle Street. Like it or not, the face of the New Towns commercial district is set for a facelt.With the demise of House of Fraser at the West End, now transformed into a whisky experience, and towards the East End the once-beloved Jenners department store due shortly to close , the heart of the city is struggling to keep up with bewildering change. Fortunately, nothing so awful is in the pipeline as the notorious proposal some years ago to build an elevated shopping mall in the gardens. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of a less stringent commercial climate is the signal it sends, and the trend it looks set to deepen.Wherever you go, Edinburgh is turning into a visitor attraction, a living museum and gallery. Useful shops for locals are a rarity. In their place is a proleration of chic cafes, glitzy on-trend eateries and luxurious hotels, all pandering to the tourist market. Thanks to the make-over of old premises and investment in new, the capital has a superficial shine, a high-cost stylish patina. But as Dickenss Mr and Mrs Veneering showed, putting your faith in appearances is risky. Yes, it creates jobs, though mostly of a lowly-paid, transitory kind. But at what cost  Do people make the trip to Edinburgh for its pubs and coffee shops, or to soak up the atmosphere of culture, history and daily le that, over centuries, have made its name Princes Street has undoubtedly been in need of improving its image for a long time now. Some initiatives are to be welcomed, such as the Quaich project, to renovate the run-down Ross Bandstand, and to \"wild\" the western part of the gardens, so they look less like a postcard from the s and rather more invitingly freeform. While that is a laudable aspiration for one side of the street, however, the other is in danger of losing whatever soul it has left.I understand that the council is in a dficult position, trying to safe-guard the future of a district caught in the retail nightmare of swtly changing, quixotic customer behaviour. That it is hoping to welcome a greater ersity of trade suggests that in one aspect at least, human habits are unchanged: eating and drinking and watching the world go by. In fact, we are consuming far more than we ever did before, willing to spend money as well as countless hours sipping lattes and beer and scoffing burgers and sushi. So much for austerity. When it comes to leisure, wallets fly open.There would be nothing wrong with broadening Princes Streets commercial scopeyou could trust those at the controls. Sadly, I have no such faith. On the evidence of recent years, the citys development is geared towards immediate gratication, mainly for migrating flocks of cash-splashing customers. Where is the long-term perspective, tailored to the true character of the city, and to the requirements and concerns of those who live in it  Why bother to ask. Such a perspective requires serious thought, knowledge and imagination, luxuries the current decision-makers dont want to afford.

In many ways, the end is barely even in sight.Months of negotiations lie ahead as Boris Johnson and European leaders thrash out a future relationship over issues such as trade and security.Behind the scenes, officials in Brussels are clear about the challenges looming on the horizon.And while the Prime Minister insists the transition period will end on December  this year, there is a suspicion several issues will run over into .The European Commission will put forward its draft mandate for the future negotiations in the coming days, which will then need to be approved by the  remaining member states.ldquoWe probably wonrsquot start formal negotiations until the end of February, beginning of March, said one senior source, setting out the tight timescale.ldquoThen we have until ndash Irsquom being very approximatehere ndash September, October, because you need to leave time for whatever agreement we reach to be ratied.ldquoAnd in between that time, you have the deadline of July  for a very important decision to be made ndash and that is the decision on whether or not we extend the transition period.They added: ldquoTime is extremely, extremely short, but we can only do what we can during that time.ldquoIt may require us prioritising certain things, and it may require certain elements to be pushed into the future as well. We will just have to wait and see.The official said there are existing contingency measures in some areas, or international fallback options.ldquoI think in terms of priority, wersquore going to be looking at security and defence cooperation, the economic relationship, fisheries, all that sort of stuff, they added.ldquoBut it may be the case that certain things arenrsquot done by the end of the year, and they will just have to continue.ldquoAndthose negotiations continue in , thatrsquos possible but yoursquore going to be in a very dferent situation, because the UK will be outside the single market and customs union.ldquoWersquoll have to be negotiating, but in a much more stressful environment, because there will be no status quo, as it were ndash the UK will be outside.Security will be a big issue going forward.The UK played a key role in setting up a new super-database of seven dferent systemsintended to protect borders and stop terrorists or organised crime gangs slipping through the net.But after Brexit, it risks being denied access to this.Fears have also been raised over the loss of access to European Arrest Warrantsand Europol, the EUrsquos law enforcement agency.One Brussels official described Europol asldquoa bit of a Scottish colony, given the crucial role Scots have played in its operations.Another said: ldquoThe UK is a serious security player, therefore there must be an interest from the EU side to have a relationship.ldquoBut there hasnrsquot ever been anything like this, so there are no obvious third country precedents.ldquoEven the precedent with the US, which is probably a closer security relationship than with any other third country is not quite analogous.Everyone agrees itrsquos in the interests of both sides to cooperate.But officials say itrsquos not that simple.ldquoJust because something is logical, which it is, and even wanted, which I suspect it is, does not mean itrsquos easy, and it isnrsquot easy because this is a legal entity, one said.ldquoThe EU is a legal entity more than itrsquos a political club.ldquoAnd therefore there are a whole set of rights and responsibilities in that, andyou decide that you are leaving certain things ndash like the jurisdiction of the court ndash then that creates a lot of things that you have to then find a workaround [for].Fishing is another crucial area, and there has been speculation the UK will trade access to its waters infor a deal on financial services.Downing Street dismissed this when it was recently suggested by Irish TaoiseachLeo Varadkar.But as one Brussels trade official put it, other EU countries land about euro million-worth of fish in UK waters.There are half a dozen or so EU member states, including France, with a powerful interest in maintaining access.

We just live in a very touch-deprived society. Itrsquos just awful.ldquoYou see people after theyrsquove hadlots of touch and theyrsquore really peaceful, content and happy and they lose the jaggedness that lots of people have.As a lawyer for more than  years before retiring last May to focus on his therapy work, Mr Fraser dealt with countless acrimonious orces and saw first-hand the effects of touch and affection deprivation.He said: ldquoOne of the things cuddle parties try and do is break the unfortunate connection that people have got with affectionate touch and sexual touch, with the consequence that people are simultaneously over-sexualised and touch deprived.As adults, who do we get touch from, he asks, especially without demand. One cuddle party-goer who was only ever touched when her husband wanted physical intimacy and received no affectionate contact was ldquoessentially starved of touch.Mr Fraser said: ldquoComing to the cuddle parties enabled her to experience affectionate, consensual touch with no sexual agenda.A hug that lasts for  seconds releases the hormone oxytocin, known as the cuddle or love hormone, which can lower blood pressure, slow heart rates and improve mood.Researchers have found that the same areas of the brain that respond positively to gentle touch also help to develop a sense of body ownership, or what Mr Fraser calls ldquoembodiment, the sense of inhabiting onersquos own body and setting healthy boundaries.The first cuddle party was held in  in the United States and soon migrated to British shores where the y started with regular events in London, facilitated by Ms Sonnenbaum.She said: ldquoA cuddle party is a way to ask for and receive loving touch in a safe non-sexual setting. This helps with finding out about our own touch preferences and communicating about them effectively without fear of being judged or rejected.ldquoWe practise saying both lsquoyesrsquo and lsquonorsquo confidently to each other. Strong personal boundaries and the ability to say lsquonorsquo are the prerequisite for letting people come close to us ndash or  this wouldnrsquot feel safe.She added: ldquoWith the rise of one-person households in big cities people donrsquot get a lot of touch which is non-sexual and my suspicion is that people have casual sex just to satisfy their skin hunger.Mr Fraser said: ldquoPeople have said things like, lsquothis is my worst nightmarersquo. But itrsquos only touch that you wish to receive ndashyou donrsquot want to get hugged by somebody, you donrsquot get hugged by them.ldquoThis is the opposite of being indiscriminately touched by other people. Itrsquos reprogramming people and itrsquos empowering people.Consent is vital and never more so than in the post #MeToo era when even consensual physical intimacy can be shadowed by fears of accusation and abuse.Mr Fraser said: ldquoThe traditional idea of consent is a bit like an army besieging a castle and the people inside surrender and open the doors and then the army can come in and do whatever they like. You agree to something and then yoursquove got to just accept whatever follows. Our idea of consent is entirely dferent ndash itrsquos based on enthusiastic consent in the moment.The importance of being able to say no to touch of any kind canrsquot be underestimated, said Mr Fraser. He added: ldquoIf a person canrsquot say no then they and the person in contact with them are both fundamentally unsafe. You have to have clarity because itrsquos onlyyou have a no that your yes means something.lEveryBody Loves Cuddle Party Workshop, CCA Glasgow, Sunday February , pm-pm."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-botanic-garden-not-common-garden","story":"Royal Botanic Garden: Not so common or gardenRoyal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh#s Mark Hughes, Research Scientist.

STY SMITHPic Gordon Terris The HeraldLeonie Paterson, archivistThe garden was established in  and the records we have come from the memoirs of our founders, two Scottish doctors called Robert Sibbald and Andrew Balfour. They had seen gardens on the continent where doctors trained in botany and medicine so they rented a piece of land in Edinburgh to do the same here.The garden would have looked beautul when it first opened, but it was strictly for the training of doctors and the public werenrsquot allowed in. I donrsquot think even now a lot of people realise the research and the science that happens here and whatrsquos been involved in bringing a lot of these plants to the UK ndash the work of the Scottish botanist George Forrest for example.Some people have called Forrest the Indiana Jones of botany and he really does deserve that title. He was a plant collector who became associated with the garden in  and went out to China. It was very risky and he couldrsquove died on numerous occasions.In  hersquod settled just off the Tibet border at a time when a lot of people in that area were quite hostile to Western influences. He heard that there was a plan to besiege his mission and kill everyone so he and two missionaries tried to escape and made their way down the river in pitch darkness on narrow paths ndash one slip and they would have been dead. They were surrounded and cut off. They had to run for their lives.Forrest was running towards the river on his own and did a five-hour climb but discovered sentries at the top so had to head back down. They were trying to track him by his footprints so he had to bury his shoes and wade up the river and hide during the day. He spent five or six days doing this but eventually, some locals helped him. Around , specimens in the Botanic Garden have Forrestrsquos name on them. We wouldnrsquot be in the shape we are nowit wasnrsquot for George Forrest.I worried when I started here that I knew nothing about plants, but for me itrsquos been about the people behind the plants and how incredible they were. Charles Austin for example was around at the time of Linnaeus and was horried at the idea that plants could have sexual parts. But Austin was a great lecturer ndash once, he self-medicated on coffee when it was unusual and described his blind spots and hallucinations to his students.I have a great love for the collection of plants. I can look at a plant and say lsquotherersquos the plant that Forrest named after his wersquo or lsquotherersquos a plant that someone almost died to getrsquo. My favourite is primula vialii. If you get a whole swathe of them together, itrsquos the most incredible sight.Hannah Wilson, Phd studentI grew up in Yorkshire and have always been interested in nature but it was quite haphazard me getting into botany. My undergraduate degree is in mathematics but I finished the course and decided I didnrsquot want to do maths anymore. I got a summer job in a garden near my parents and got into rhododendrons and ended up working there for four years. Irsquom now studying for a PHD looking at begonias in New Guinea.Begonias are a very interesting group to research because theyrsquore so erse and we have a very good collection here at the Botanics. Later this year, Irsquoll be going on the Botanicsrsquo th anniversary expedition to the central range of mountains in Papua New Guinea. Wersquoll be starting in the north and heading south and wersquoll be ascending m. The idea is that all along the -mile route, we will set up base camps and survey the incredible ersity of plants there. We will be camping in the forest and sleeping in hammocks because therersquos no flat ground. Irsquove never slept in a hammock before!We are definitely going to find new plants on this trip. New Guinea is still very much under-studied itrsquos incredibly erse. Papua New Guinea makes up only about . per cent of the global land area but itrsquos estimated to harbour up to  per cent of all global plants, animals and insects. People have always assumed that the flora of Papua New Guinea is safe because itrsquos so remote and dficult to get to, but there is a global threat from climate change. But the more immediate threat in New Guinea is logging and mining and palm oil plantations.Itrsquos exciting to be at the Botanic Garden this year and itrsquos humbling when I remember that Irsquom a tiny part of such a huge institution. Historically, itrsquos been a lot about the plants themselves and collecting them and we still do a lot of that, but now I see us moving towards bioersity loss and the climate crisis.Martine Borge, conservation horticulturistI grew up in Norway and went up into the mountains a lot and always felt connected to the vegetation that was all around it gave me a sense of place. We would pick things to take home and I love working with my hands. Irsquove got mud under my nails right now. Some of the sites we work in are dficult to get to but I love that side of the job. Sometimes we have to use drones just to get a look at a plant.I work on the Scottish Rare Plants project and Scottish rare plants that are threatened. We have  per cent of Scotlandrsquos threatened species growing here within the gardens and I look after them the other side is having some of that material available for reintroduction and bringing the plants back into the wild to try to establish more healthy populations. Getting things re-established can be a challenge ndash all the threat may still be present and we are facing climate change as well.One of our big projects is with a plant called alpine blue sow thistle which is only growing in four sites in the Cairngorms. Itrsquos on the brink and all the sites are tiny little ledges where itrsquos safe from grazing from sheep and deer. Itrsquos a big problem for most threatened plants in Scotland. We collect material and itrsquos grown here and wersquove been able to cross-pollinate between dferent populations. It can be sad to see them clinging to ledges but we have five new sites for the thistle. You feel very attached to the plants you work with ndash they are so charismatic and having a connection to plants is good for your general wellbeing.I am worried about where we are in Scotland ndash we have a lot of beautul wild looking spaces but actually a lot of those spaces are grazed and you can see that they are very bare and botanically quite poor. We need links between populations and habitats and a reduction in the number of deer.The Botanics mean so much to me and I feel proud to work here. Wersquore very much ahead of the curve on conservation. We have so much to learn from plants ndash they are making use of renewable resources all the time and doing their thing. A big thing is not taking plants for granted some of them have uses that they havenrsquot even worked out.David Knott, curator of the living collectionsI was born in Edinburgh and actually learned to walk in the Botanics. My grandfather was an old-style pharmacist and grew a lot of plants in his garden my parents werenrsquot terribly keen on gardening so it skipped a generation. I came to the Botanics as a student of horticulture over  years ago. If you have a passion for plants, the Botanics is one of the finest plant collections in Scotlandnot the world. We have , plants over four gardens.In our gardens, therersquos definitely been a sht to more ecological planting. We have a Chilean hillside at Benmore, a Tasmanian forest at Logan, Nepalese planting at Dawyck and here in Edinburgh we have a Chinese hillside. Growing plants that are endangered is an increasing part of what we do ndash understanding the threats as well. We want to explain and conserve for a better future.One of my favourite plants is the Scottish primrose which grows up on the Sutherland coast. The emotional connection to plants was brought home to me when we had the storm of  when we lost a number of substantial trees in each of our gardens. What was interesting to see were the emotions of regular visitors to the garden. They were horried to see the extent of the damage and the support we got surprised me ndash I could see how much people enjoy and respect the gardens.Recovering from the storm is a process of replanting but the timelines are very dferent from human timelines ndash yoursquore planting not just for one or two generations but five or six. When we lose trees, itrsquos sad but itrsquos obviously an opportunity to replant as well.The effect of climate change in the gardens is something wersquove been aware of for - years. In the last ten years, wersquove had our windiest, coldest and warmest weather. Wersquove just installed a rain garden to mitigate some of the impacts of climate change ndash the aim is to capture and reduce the run-off.Gardeners are by their very nature optimistic. Losing a tree in a storm or a plant to a disease leaves a gap and an opportunity. We have to garden more sustainably so we mitigate some of the impacts of climate change. Itrsquos about going back to the basics that our parents or grandparents were using.Dr Mark Hughes, researcherI am from Cumbria originally and worked in industry for years before I quit and went to university to do botany and Irsquove now been working on begonias for  years. My interest started when I was an undergraduate and was the botanist on an expedition to Ecuador and spent a lot of time looking for begonias. I became fascinated by them.What fascinates me most is the massive ersity ndash itrsquos the fastest growing group in terms of the species that are being discovered. On average, across the world, wersquore discovering between  and  new species every year. Some of them have very tiny distributions, they might grow on one rock and nowhere . Itrsquos important we carry on doing this work to ensure all these rare plants have a voice and recognition ndashthey havenrsquot got a name, they can be ignored ndash a fundamental first step to getting protection for bioersity is making sure they have a name. It grows and it has a voice.What wersquore trying to do is stop extinctions by bringing things in to cultivation ndash we can give plants an official threat status at ious levels from least concern to critically endangered. We can discover something only for it to go straight on the threatened list, which happens quite a lot.Sometimes itrsquos heart-breaking. Irsquove been to parts of Borneo for example to parts of the country which are meant to be protected and therersquos not a tree left standing. You can feel powerless itrsquos a mixture of coal mining and palm oil. It would be easy to feel overwhelmed, butI can just save a handful of things, that is still worthwhile. Itrsquos important not to get despondent because there are still people doing really great work. There is a gradual awakening and people feel they have more of a responsibility ndash we have to translate that into some kind of action.We are still in a golden age of discovery ndash itrsquos estimated that globally the biggest flora of the world is the undiscovered flora and I can go into a forest and think lsquowhat the hell is that  That is totally newrsquo.Therersquos probably about , species still to be discovered. As for begonias, because there are nearly  species, wersquore kind of running out of names because you canrsquot use the same name twice so we have to get quite creative quite often I name them after people whorsquove been associated with collecting them. There is a begonia named after me ndash begonia hughesii. Itrsquos lovely. Irsquoll leave a bit of a legacy.The Botanics has stood the test of time because it has always modernised. We depend on our archive and our past but wersquore never the same. We are focusing far, far more on conservation - we are realising the value of applying what wersquore doing more directly to conservation and that will be part of our new strategy for the future."},{"url":null,"title":"fiona-rintoul-without-gaelic-cannot-understand-history---embrace-future","story":"This level of multilingualism is normal in Switzerland and in many countries across Europe.

Without it, we cannot properly understand our history or pronounce the place names in our own country. Whether we live in a Gaelic-speaking area or not, Gaelic is part of our collective Scottish heritage.It is a joyous miracle that Gaelic has survived as a living language despite the slings and arrows chucked at it by outrageous fortune. And yet, people moan about dual-language road signs, which would be considered normal anywhere , and rage against the spending of pound million a year by Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig to promote the Gaelic language.This is an amount that would scarcely keep some English Premier League footballers in designer undies for six months. Or to put it another way, itrsquos pound a head. I personally feel Irsquove got more than my poundrsquos worth from all the Gaelic words Irsquove learnt from the road signs.Recently, we hit a new low in linguistic ignorance when MSP Liz Smith, the Scottish Conservativersquos education spokeswoman, suggested that Comhairle nan Eilean Siarrsquos Gaelic first policy in primary schools would disadvantage children. Her remarks called to mind my -year-old neighbour on Harris who was punished as a child for speaking Gaelic in school and was not taught to read and write his first language.That harms children ndash and the adults they become. Teaching them in their native language first does not.Of course, children in the Hebrides can and must learn English too. They will then be in the hugely advantageous position of being bilingual. And when you are bilingual, you become like my Swiss friends you find it easy to learn further languages.:Homes for Gaelic speakers and a Google office in South Uist... what will it take to revive Gaelic in Scotland We desperately need people who can do that. Adult minds can be prised open to accommodate language learning, but the best time to do it is childhood. All language learning enriches us, and we should welcome any initiative that encourages multilingualism, be it the Comhairlersquos Gaelic first policy or the Scottish Governmentrsquos +.This is partly about economics. You can do business in English in a lot of countries. But you can do it much betteryou have people who speak the language of your target market and understand its culture. Research from the British Chamber of Commerce shows that % of UK SMEs that export have no foreign-language ability for the markets they serve. This kind of monolingualism shaves some .% off Britains GDP.Itrsquos not just about economics, though. Itrsquos also about how we are in the world.For to be an English-language monoglot is to live in a gilded cage. You donrsquot have to make an effort other people do that. You donrsquot have to struggle for words and make mistakes others must expose themselves. But in the end, you are the loser.You miss out on the opportunity to see the world in an alternative way that learning a foreign language brings. People understand your language, but you donrsquot understand theirs. Which effectively means that they know you, but you donrsquot know them.This is how the UK came fatally to misunderstand Germany in the Brexit negotiations. German language learning in the UK is in a parlous state. Only a tiny minority of British people can read German newspapers and books or watch German TV. And so, it became possible for UK politicians to think that for Germany the EU is all about flogging expensive cars, when in fact it is about peace our time, and Germany ainrsquot going to compromise the latter for the former.Yesterday, we left the European Union. If more people in the UK had engaged in the mind-expanding business of learning another language, we would perhaps never have voted to leave. Not just because we would have been better able to take advantage of the colossal economic and cultural opportunities that free movement offered, but also because we would have better understood our neighbours.Now wersquore out, and itrsquos brave new world time. English will no longer be as important a language in the EU as it was, possibly spelling the end of what might be termed the English language century.It could be time to embrace multilingualism or die. Here in Scotland, we can start at home by respecting our Gaelic culture, not as a pretty relic with some good tunes, but as a living, breathing part of us. Not to do so is a form of self-starvation. Gaelic is a gt to treasure, not a burden to shoulder."},{"url":null,"title":"rab-macneil-phrase-coin-grammar-drama","story":"First, as I understand it, many of you are worried about the economy. To some, this is such a dficult subject that economists themselves always get it wrong .But the economy is perfectly simple. Herersquos how it works. Somebody makes things. Somebody buys things. We all live happily ever after. Irsquom sure you can grasp the gist.However, in order to buy things, one must have coinage. And, even though much of this is now electronic or virtual, clunky coins in the hand or pocket seem fittingly symbolic to celebrate the past that we are now about to enter.Accordingly, a p commemorative Brexit Day coin has been issued. A harmless gesture, you might think, in normal times. But these are not normal times. People have become unhinged. A coin has been issued, and they have gone doolally.Opponents of Brexit ndash people with a passionate interest in trade agreements ndash have reacted with uncharacteristic extremism and irrationality, some even threatening to decorate the coins withswastikas ndash yup ndash this referring to the historical fact that the Nazis once held a democratic referendum to find outGermanyrsquos citizens wanted to invade Europe.Among those exercised disproportionately is fantasy author Sir Philip Pullman, who called for a boycott of the coin on the grounds that the rubric was allegedly ungrammatical. He lamented, in particular, the lack of a so-called Oxford comma after ldquoprosperity in the words ldquoPeace, prosperity and friendship with all nations.What an interesting and surely well-meant phrase. Who coined it, as it were, originally  Was it Hitler  At any rate, the grammar Gestapo goose-stepped all over it though, soon, a Resistance sprang up, arguing that the comma was purely optional and even ndash look away now, Martha ndash an Americanism, presumably being named after the famous university city there.Nothing is simple any more. Although a simple man myself, I was ndash seriously ndash once accused in a bookof knowing what an Oxford comma was, but it turns out that I did not.I thought it separated phrases. Thus,I write, ldquoIt was blue and hellip, without a comma after ldquoblue, the expectation is that more description of ldquoIt will be forthcoming. However,Irsquom intending to say, ldquoIt was blue, and I wanted one, the comma is neededso as not to lead people up a garden path that promises more adjectives but doesnrsquot deliver. Similarly, yoursquoll see that, earlier, I bunged in a comma when saying: ldquoA coin has been issued, and they have gone doolally. Thatrsquos because, without the comma, the expectation is of more verbiage about the coin, whereas the subject has now changed . Drsquoyou see Most people donrsquot do this and, as a bit of a grammar stormtrooper myself, that irritates me, though not intensely. At any rate, thatrsquos what I thought an Oxford comma was, and I donrsquot see anyway why a commq is necessary in lists such as ldquopeace, prosperity and friendship. Using it to separate the last and penultimate items serves no purpose.But, truthfully, I donrsquot have a clue about such stuff. I just sound sentences in my head and shove in punctuation where I detect a hellip pause. At the end of the day, all thatrsquos required is that you make your meaning luculent.One wonders what Sir Philip would have made of the rubric on the old threepenny bit which read: ldquo+Elizabeth.II.Dei.Gratia.Regina.F:D: Latin  Itrsquos all Greek to me.In the meantime, perhaps he could spend his unwanted coinage in the new p lavatories at Drumnadrochit. At least there, he would know that his colon was in the right place.++++IN these dystopian times, I live by the motto: ldquotwo wheels bad, two legs good. I might also make a casefor: ldquotwo wheels bad, four wheels good. At the time of going to press, I cannot find anything particularly meaningful in ldquotwo wheels bad, four feet good.However, perhaps dogs might find it useful. At any rate, yoursquoll notice the common denominator in each motto: ldquotwo wheels bad. Hitherto, this has applied only to cyclists, those narcissistic bullies who cause danger to pedestrians and motorists alike.However, they could soon have an ally in other equally irresponsible road-users: to wit, hooligans gadding about on E-scooters.The British Government will shortly hold a consultation on allowing these satanic conveyances on roads used by normal people, despite warnings from abroad that the result will be ldquoanarchy.In France and Germany, E-scooter users have been accused, as with cyclists here, of ruining green or scenic footpaths. They also share with cyclists a predilection for pavements.George Orwell wrote about ldquoold maids bicycling to Holy Communion through the early morning mist. That was bad enough. Think how much worse it would bethe old louts were on E-scooters.++++AS someone who dislikes controversy, Irsquom not going to comment specically on the Mystery of the Alastair Stewart Tweet. The ITN newsreaderrsquos communication was allegedly racist, evenall indications suggest otherwise.Some perspective: As noted previously, the original equality campaigners were good, enlightened iniduals slowly, they gained the ascendancy and, for a while, all was well then the original ideals were twisted back on themselves and are now misused to damage innocent parties.However, this third stage has gone on a while now. In the s, I wrote in my local paper about a menace who drove about the town in the wee smarsquo hours waking people up with his street-cleaning machine.My description of himincluded, inter-alia, the observation that he was black-haired, which caused his union branch to raise the possibility that this was racist.A few years later, I confronted some clots about their incompetence, saying the job would have been better carried out by chimpanzees at the zoo. Whereupon, they pointed out that one of their number was of mixed-race. Cue jaw hitting floor. Why make such a connection Lesson: many people become so obsessed with racism that they become racist.++++OFFERED a choice of carrot or stick most Earthlings would opt for the former. The stick breeds resentment, the carrot happiness, and the happy learner scores higher than the resentful one.This has been proven in a study of , American children by Brigham Young University. Dr Paul Caldarella found that pupils in classes with the highest praise-to-reprimand ratio paid attention  to  per cent longer than those where scolding was prevalent.That said, my feeling is that humiliation and shame are better weapons in the battle to educate the nationrsquos nippers.True, it would breed resentment in many. However, it worked for me. A shy child, I blushed madly whenever I was the centre of attention, prompting the other inmates to point at me and shout: ldquoBeamer!Accordingly, I figured the way to avoid this persecution was to get things right. I was shamed, effectively, into becoming the knowledgable and wise figure you see before you today.Spare the rod and spoil the child was always poppycock. The correct formula is shame the child and watch it learn. The probability that, outside school, it will smash windows and pee on cars is beyond the scope of this discussion.Read more: Pullman calls for boycott of Brexit p over missing Oxford comma"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-matrix-britain-can-take-control-future","story":"On what was a historic Brexit Day, the comment focused on the end of a relationship with Europe as we know it.The Daily Its editorial says Britain is taking back control and once \"our lawmakers are fully in charge, there will be no one  to blame for error or inaction. The future will be in our hands.\"It goes on to say \"leavers have every right to rejoice - some of them have been working for this for decades - but the mood is magnanimous, even quiet. That is partly because Brexit was delayed for so long that the public is exhausted by it, but it is also because Euroscepticism, though passionate, has always been driven by reason.\"At pm tonight [Friday], we enter a transition period in which the UK has to hammer out a new relationship with the EU, settling as much as possible before December . It is a Herculean task, especially when combined with the start of formal trade talks with other nations, chief among them the United States. The pressure from Eurosceptics to deliver a proper Brexit cannot relent the pressure from some Remainers to keep Britain as closely aligned to Brussels as possible will have to be resisted. Mr Johnson will also try to weave this process into his grander narrative of shaping a more One Nation Britain, which must rest on the conservative foundations of opportunity, a small state and strong institutions that allow the inidual to thrive in an environment of ordered liberty. \"It goes on to say \"what we are going to discover in the coming years is that a lot of the crippling legislation holding Britain back is home-grown, not from the EU - yet the fight for Brexit is an existing catalyst for going back to the drawing board to rethink who we are, what we stand for and what we want to be.\"Gaby Hinslf says Remainers are often not that comfortable talking about their identities as Europeans, but that doesnt mean we dont have them or feel them intensely at a time like this.She says: \"And when I think about what it means to me to be European, as well as as profoundly English, I inevitably end up not with the EU flag or the day-to-day business of the Brussels institutions , but a gut sense acquired in childhood that foreign isnt frightening, and lives opened up to the world will be more exciting than ones shut away from it. People who backed remain made and lost their case on more practical, hard-boiled economic arguments, steering clear of the muddier emotional territory. But as Britain reaches tonights point of nofrom Brexit, its the deeper gut feelings that are bubbling up. The battle to stay in the EU was finally lost in December, but the debate about how we can stay European - how to keep the door open, preserve the social and cultural ties that bind, prevent Britain becoming a crabby and shrivelled country alienated from its own continent - needs blowing wide open.\"The TimesIts editorial says \"control willto Britain and it is now up to the government to decide what to do with it. Hard choices lie ahead.

Britain has received a brutal reminder in recent weeks of the high price that President Trump is likely to seek for a trade deal. China is no longer regarded as a benign trade partner, as the row over Huawei has demonstrated. The World Trade Organisation is increasingly paralysed by Mr Trumps refusal to appoint new judges.\"Britain has a chance to do things dferently, adapting its economic model in ways that work better for the whole country. Plans for a new immigration system that ends free movement for EU citizens could deliver long-term benefitsit leads to higher wages and forces employers to invest in equipment and skills. Britain will have the freedom to deviate from EU rules that hold it back, for example by making it easier for pharmacists to train as doctors. Britain can also develop a trade policy that prioritises its own interests.

In each case, however, this is above all a time for pragmatism.The UK may now be set upon a dferent path from the EU, but the degree to which it will erge will not become clear for months, indeed years, to come. It may take decades before it is clear whether we are heading in an entirely new direction or, like other European nations currently outwith the EU, on a parallel, perhaps fairly closely aligned, path.Setting aside previous dferences is essentialthis journey is to proceed as smoothly as possible. It was welcome that the former Brexit minister Steve Baker should say this was no time for ardent Leavers to gloat, and should recognise that many are saddened by the outcome. By the same token, the most fervent Remainers should accept that the new circumstances will not be improved by constant carping and doom-mongering.Scotland, where a sizeable majority voted against Brexit, has dferent needs and concerns from much of the rest of the UK. The priority must now be to focus not on previous preferences, but on protecting those interests.That will entail the government at Holyrood working with Westminster in order to make the new settlement work. Those whose ultimate goal is independence need, for the moment, to focus on the immediate challenges facing Scotland. Ensuring a stable future for agriculture, healthcare, immigration needs, fisheries and a host of other areas will mean making responsible choices, rather than obstruction in order to further ision, or foolish gestural politics about EU flags and the like.Similarly, Westminster must demonstrate genuine respect for the way in which those sectors may require special attention, accommodation and support, rather than attempting to strongarm Holyrood. Boris Johnsonrsquos government must also adjust to the fact that,those who ndash like most Scots ndash voted Remain should accept Brexit and move forward, there can be no justication for stirring up English nativist feeling.The national interest of Scotland, England and the UK as a whole will be served only by a willingness to accept, with equal vigour and honesty, the opportunities and dficulties we all now face, not by amplying or denying them.It may be that those challenges will increase the pressure for independencethe Prime Minister intends to maintain a United Kingdom, let alone forge the new spirit of unity and optimism his rhetoric suggests, he will have to acknowledge them ndash as he has done for those in the north of England. From today, it is irrelevant that they were largely Leave voters, and Scots largely Remain voters: vital decisions need to be made ndash especially in areas where EU funding or regulation was most signicant ndash to safeguard communities, livelihoods and economic stability.This is a time for humility, cooperation and practical action from those who, like Mr Johnson, successfully advocated this new direction in our politics, and one for acceptance from those who opposed it. The day-to-day priorities of voters all across the UK have been obscured by years of wrangling on this issue its resolution, for good or ill, makes it the more urgent that politicians across the boardtheir focus to them. And whether it proves to be for good or ill will depend on a clear-eyed view of the real priorities of most voters.There is no longer any point in painting le outside the EU as a triumph or a disaster: it is where we are. What matters now is to picture the ways in which we can make a success of the new landscape, and to draw up plans for overcoming the problems, and seizing the opportunities, that it presents."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-let-us-hang-eu-values-respect-compassion","story":"July .

The real impact of Brexit will not be felt for over a year and will almost certainly result in the withdrawal of foreign car plants and the collapse of our native car industry. Food will certainly rise in price, along with all imports. Our farming and fishing industries will suffer, but since they all voted Leave, they only have themselves to blameThe main problem for the rest of us is high unemployment, combined with low paid and insecure jobs. The Government consists of mainly multi-millionaires who have prudently transferred their main assets offshore. They plan on making a killing out of a low-wage, low-security workforce and will keep benefits low so that many will live at the poverty level.The future is less bright than the Brexiters would have you believe and this, combined with the ongoing slow but sure dismantling of our NHS, will ensure a poor and fairly short-lived workforce who have no rights and little say in events, but who have taken back control and now have their own sovereignty.James Evans, Dumbarton.ldquoWHO do you think you are kidding, Mr Johnson,If you think old Englandrsquos won Kenneth Fraser, St Andrews.LET me get this right, John Edgarclearly wants an independent Scotland to join the European Union.

We transformed the landscape of our country.\"There are some that say we shouldnt celebrate tonight, but we are going to celebrate tonight.\"He added: \"The people have beaten the establishment.

A request for a transfer of power, through a section  order was made by Ms Sturgeon last monthin the aftermath of the SNPs landslide election victory north of the border. But it was swtly rejected by Boris Johnson a few weeks later. The Scottish constitutional convention of the s was the driving force behind the creation of the Scottish Parliament and Ms Sturgeon set out plans for a similar body to help build the case for independence.\"We will invite Scotland elected representatives - MSPs, MPs, the MEPs elected last year and council leaders – to come together to endorse a modern Claim of Right for Scotland through a new Constitutional Convention,\" Ms Sturgeon revealed.\"To declare that it is for the Scottish Parliament to decide whether and when there should be an independence choice and build support for that principle amongst civic Scotland.\"The Scottish Government has already begun work on a new new case for independence, in the same vein as the Scotlands Future document publish ahead of the  vote.This will ensure Scots have the information they need to \"make informed choices about the future of the country\", Ms Sturgeon added.\"In the coming months, the Scottish Government will publish the outcome of that work,\" she said.The “New Scotland” series of papers” will seek to provide the information and answers people want.\"They will provide detail on how Scotland can make the transition from a Yes vote to becoming an independent country.\"But Tory leader Jackson Carlaw said Ms Sturgeon was seeking to keep the \"isive debate going\" in Scotland.\"Nicola Sturgeon’s determination to plough on with preparations for another vote on independence is predictable, depressing and entirely wrong-headed,\" Mr Carlaw said.“People across Scotland are sick and tired of her relentless pursuit of a referendum they simply don’t want.“What people do want is action now to improve education, health, policing and all the other services they rely upon.“On the day we leave the EU they want a government which focuses on Scotlands economy and jobs.“And they want Nicola Sturgeon to put her referendum plans where they belong – firmly on the backburner.\"Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: teh speech was designed to distract from the SNP’s \"catastrophic failings\" in government.“It is sickening that Nicola Sturgeon is willing to neglect struggling schools and hospitals, and waste even more public money on her never-ending campaign to ide the people of Scotland. She even failed to rule out a Catalan-style ‘consultative’ referendum that would result in an expensive legal battle,\" she said.The decision to allow the Electoral Commission test the question comes after concerns that it may be advantageous to the pro-independence campaign. Although the watchdog tested the question ahead of the last referendum, subsequent research saw it reject a Yes No approach for the  Brexit referendum on the basis that this could sway the outcome in favour of the positive \"yes\" response. Instead voters had a \"Remain or Leave\" option in the EU vote.Ms Sturgeon said the current question is \"simple, intelligible and well recognised across the country.\"But she added: \"Parliament made clear it wanted it re-tested and it is the next practical step we need to take within our powers to prepare for a referendum.\"Ms Sturgeon said the UK Governments rejection of another independence referendum is \"a sign of weakness, not of strength\".She said: \"If they had any confidence in the argument for the Westminster union, they would have no problem with the people of Scotland having the right to choose.\"It is the fear of defeat that is making them so desperate to deny us the choice. We should draw encouragement from that.\"The SNP will double their campaign budget to push for a second vote, according to the First Minister - but she urged activists to listen to people who are against independence.She said: \"Our party campaign is therefore ready to ramp up. We aim to double the SNP campaign budget this year to support new independence materials, local newspaper adverts and a new campaign film focused on undecided voters.\"It is vital that as we campaign we listen and engage respectfully.\"There are many people out there who voted No in  now thinking about independence dferently in light of Brexit.\"We must show that we understand the complexity of the issues they grapple with and that, for many, emotions will be mixed.

Matthew Taggart, , who is in the first year of a foundation degree apprenticeship in Civil and Environmental Engineering at Translink in Belfast, said he believes the opportunity to gain qualications with no fees while getting paid to work is something that all young people should consider.Workplus, which helps employers develop talent through apprenticeships, estimates that almost poundm will be earned by the successful candidates over the period of their apprenticeships, some of which will last up to six years, with the possibility of permanent jobs.Those successful will take up positions at companies including Farrans, Translink, Atkins, Liberty IT, Jacobs and McAdam Design in the autumn to gain on the job training in career areas including engineering, construction, IT, administration and accountancy.Matthew said: “After my AS Levels at Ballymena Academy I went straight into a Workplus apprenticeship with Translink and spent two years doing a Level  BTEC. “Now I’m in the first year of a foundation degree, working on projects at Translink which are both interesting and challenging four days a week and attending classes at South West College in Omagh one day a week.“The greatest benefit of being an apprentice is that I’m able to work and learn on the job, while also working towards the qualications I need to apply for jobs within the industry.“Some of my friends who are at university wish they’d taken the same path as me because I’m earning a wage and as my fees are being paid I’ll have no debt at the end. I’d recommend that all young people considering higher education take a look at the apprenticeship opportunities available with Workplus.”Gavin McFarland, Programme Manager at Translink, said: “Workplus gives us access to a large pool of talented young people. Our Civil Engineering apprentices are valued members of our Infrastructure and Projects team. They take full advantage of opportunities to develop their academic learning and professional qualications, while earning an attractive salary. We are pleased to support Workplus and would recommend it to other employers seeking to attract talented young people. “Richard Kirk, Director of Workplus, explained: “Many of the young people who are applying for Workplus Apprenticeships are telling us that full time study along with the debt and career uncertainty at the end is not the right route for them.“Our apprentices get real jobs, good pay with a starting salary between pound, to pound, depending on entry level, as well as access to training and professional networks that will transform their lives.”Applications for this year’s Workplus scheme are open until February  at www.workplus.app "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2719899.jpg--.jpg?1580378297000\n","title":"my top 10 artie mcauley s musical memories","story":"THE next rambler on our new musical meander down memory lane is the inimitable Mr. Artie McAuley.

I’ll try where I can to find outanybody nearby owns the property. These places are almost always in a bad state of repair – broken windows, roofs and doors missing. “If it’s somewhere that’s been left open you’re not breaking and entering and you’re not going in to commit a crime so you can’t be prosecuted for that either. Michael likes to tell a story through the items that have been left behind“You’re going in at your own risk. If you can’t get in you write it off and move on. Like I say it’s a grey area so I prefer to keep a low profile and let my pictures speak for themselves.”Michael shares the photographs he takes via his Facebook and Instagram pages entitled Forgotten Places NI: “I respect people’s privacy andI’m ever asked to take any photos down I do it straight away.“I do it for the love of old buildings and their contents, it’s as simple as that. It’s a hobby and I don’t try to make any money from it. “I had been taking photos for my own pleasure to start with but when I showed them to other people they said I needed to share them online because they were so good. That’s why I started up Forgotten Places NI.”An old ambulance found at a derelict propertyMichael’s photographs are posted with a short description of the property but little detail about the location unless it’s somewhere that’s easily recognisable. He said he likes to keep his best finds to himself: “I know a couple of other guys who do this. There’s ones who take photographs and sell them. Mine is purely a hobby.“I’ll get messages from other people asking where I’ve been. I don’t always tell them. It’s dog eat dog. It sounds stupid because there’s nothing to gain from it. It’s one-upmanship to find somewhere that no one  has posted about.Masonic supports Charity work Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“I don’t get why people would exchange locations. I don’t see the point. It’s finding the places and not knowing what’s going to be inside that does it for me. If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. A well lived in room“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”Some of the items left behindThe scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening Prayer"},{"url":null,"title":"new ulster hockey kirk cup sponsorship deal to help raise funds for ni children s hospice","story":"Ahead of the final, NI Law Firm of the Year, Millar McCall Wylie, has announced a sponsorship deal with Ulster Hockey to back the competition through to the end of .Chief Operating Officer, Christopher McCandless said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be sponsoring the Kirk Cup, both this season and next.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit six former northern ireland meps on work and life at the european parliament","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In , as Pope John Paul II began his address in Strasbourg, Paisley rose to his feet and roared that \"the Antichrist\" wasnt welcome. He waved a poster denouncing the pontf as he shouted a quotation from a th century Protestant martyr.Other MEPs wrenched the banner from him, and he was hauled out of the chamber while the Pope looked on with amusement.But, despite the occasional fireworks, Paisley formed an unrivalled partnership in Brussels with Northern Irelands next most famous MEP John Hume.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetJim NicholsonFormer Ulster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson completed an influential trio. \"As we huddled together in Brussels to discuss things, other MEPs would look on expecting a fight to break out. It never did,\" he recalls.\"John would sometimes exclaim My God! or Oh Jesus! and Ian would jokingly reprimand him for taking the Lords name in vain, but that was the height of it.\"They always put \"Northern Ireland PLC\" first, Nicholson says. \"The constitutional issue didnt arise.\"This was mostly during direct rule. There was no Stormont executive. The three of us were the voice of Northern Ireland abroad.\"We worked together through awful times - the Shankill bomb, Greysteel and other atrocities. We had to learn a dferent style of politics in Europe.\"Our system at home was so combative. Over there, it was all about compromise. You realised you didnt always get your own way and you learned to make friends.\"Nicholson says his proudest moment came when the trio met the then European Commission president Jacques Delors in  after the IRA ceasefire.\"Delors said, What can I do for you gentlemen  We said Its what you can do for the people of Northern Ireland. They need help from the bottom up. Out of that meeting came the EUs Peace and Reconciliation Fund which has delivered over bn for Northern Ireland.\"Naomi LongAlliance leader Naomi Long wore suffragette colours - purple and green - as she delivered her final speech in Brussels on Wednesday.\"I wanted to mark how far Northern Ireland has travelled,\" she says. \"I grew up watching three male MEPs representing us. We left the EU represented by three women.\"Elected eight months ago, Long was just starting to find her way around the parliament. \"I got lost loads of times,\" she laughs. \"Its a vast and confusing place at first. I got locked in the Visitors Centre one night. I had to take photos on my mobile phone and send them to my assistant to come and rescue me.\"Long previously sat at Westminster as East Belfast MP. \"The Brussels parliament had the feel of an airport terminal,\" she says.\"The House of Commons is very dferent. Its steeped in history. Its beautul and atmospheric but the chamber is small and it can be very crowded.\"The European parliament was built for purpose. Its much more civilised and comfortable. You had your own seat and desk.\"I liked the u-shaped chamber compared to the oppositional Commons. Everything in Brussels was about being inclusive and securing a consensus, not just a majority. I will take that away with me and I hope we can do it at Stormont.\"Long describes the parliaments Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt as \"a real character\".\"If people think I talk a lot, they need to hear him. He wasnt always helpful in what he said but he did do battle for Northern Ireland\".The \"most intriguing\" MEP Long met was the Brexit Partys Claire Fox. She was \"a left-winger in a right-wing party. I felt she was a person of genuine principle when so many of her colleagues were just there for the publicity and the ride.\"She genuinely engaged with the Remain argument. She was intellectually stimulating but politically frustrating for me.\"Long describes the journey to Strasbourg - where the European parliament sat one week a month - as \"a camel trek\". It involved \"numerous planes, trains and automobiles\" and could take up to  hours.Michel Barnier and Diane DoddsDUP MEP Diane Dodds agrees and says the parliament should \"be like every other one and sit in one place\".She accuses the EU of double standards: \"It aims to become a zero carbon economy by  but it adds signicantly to its own carbon footprint by the travelling circus of moving from Brussels to Strasbourg once a month.\"Being an MEP meant \"a very transient lestyle\", Dodds says. She was first elected when her daughter Robyn was . \"It was dficult for both of us. Sometimes I tried to come home mid-week but that wasnt always possible.\"Like other MEPs, she lived for years in hotels - not apartments - in Brussels and Strasbourg. \"I didnt mind. Im a relaxed person. I dont fuss,\" she adds.Having grown up on a farm, the highs of her MEP role was whenever the focus was on agriculture. The lows were the  Brussels airport and metro station bombs which killed  people, and the  Strasbourg Christmas market attack.Dodds says: \"After the airport bomb, Arlene Foster and Peter Robinson rang me to seeI was okay. I was in my office on the phone when I heard a thud.\"Another bomb had gone off at the metro nearby. I dont think Brussels has ever recovered its equilibrium.\"Two years later, I was sitting in a restaurant in Strasbourg with staff after visiting the Christmas market when suddenly police burst in, turned off the lights and ordered us away from the windows. A gunman had shot dead five people in the next street.\"Martina AndersonLike Dodds, Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson found the journey to Strasbourg taxing. \"During Storm Brendan, it took me  hours and four flights to get there - from Belfast to Cardf to Paris to Amsterdam to Strasbourg. It was a demanding job, and you had to be up for it,\" she says.There were other challenges. \"My mother Betty had Alzheimers and we cared for her at home. Near the end, it was very dficult,\" Anderson says.\"Three times, she was at deaths door. I got phone calls to come home and I thought I wouldnt make it. I was terried she would die before I got to hold her one last time.\"My husband put the phone to her ear so I could talk to her. She pulled through twice. The third time, she didnt but I did make it home to be with her before she passed away.\"Another \"awful time\" was in  when Anderson was told Martin McGuinness had died. \"I headed to the airport immediately. I was distraught. It was the worst journey of my le. I just wanted to be with him as he was brought home,\" she says.\"I was too upset to drive. A friend came to Dublin Airport to pick me up. Im sure the speed limit was broken many times. As we came down the flyover we could see Martins coffin coming to Free Derry Corner. I just got out of the car and ran to the cortege.\"Anderson is most proud of \"working so hard with the EU to get them to understand that the Good Friday Agreement had to be protected in all its part and of securing a protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement ensuring there will be no hardening of the border\".In her Brussels office, she had a photo of a Derry GAA team, Ballymenas coat of arms - a gt from a cross-community delegation - and portraits of  leader Countess Markievicz and trade unionist Jim Larkin.\"Ive taken them home with me but Ive left my clothes and other bits and pieces with charities in Brussels for those in need,\" she says.Jim AllisterTUV leader and former barrister Jim Allister was a DUP MEP for five years. He found the travelling made the job \"surprisingly more exhausting than being at the Bar even though it was much less intellectually demanding\".Living in a hotel four nights a week was a \"big adjustment\", he says, \"although Im not sureit was a burden or a relief to my we Ruth\".He adored Strasbourg. \"It had a stunning historic centre on the River Ill, a beautul cathedral and some nice parks. It was lovely in summer but very cold in winter,\" he says.\"Outside of Grand Place, there wasnt much to like in Brussels.\"Allister says while he went to Brussels \"a Eurosceptic and left an even stronger one as a result of what I saw\", it was still \"a great privilege to stand up and speak on behalf of my country and I took it seriously\".He felt the multiplicity of languages killed the parliament as a debating chamber.\"It was a stilted place. The interpreters are very skilled but theres still a natural lag between the spoken word and when you hear it in your ear,\" he says. \"It ruled out the cut and thrust of debate.\"The other thing I struggled with was the restricted speaking time. Your mic was turned ofyou went over two minutes. Saying what you wanted became an art.\"Allister sat near Nigel Farage whom he came to know well. \"Hes a fantastic orator - he has it down to a tee. He was utterly fearless, I had a lot of time for him.\"Fond farewell: Nigel Farage in celebratory mood at the EU Parliament this week but Diane Dodds is more reservedSo did the teetotal TUV leader socialise with Farage who is known for his love of a pint  \"We had the occasional meal together. But no, I didnt go out on the tear with him as you put it.\"He was also impressed with Tanaiste Simon Coveney when he was an MEP and Fine Gaels Mairead McGuinness. They were \"very knowledgeable\" on agriculture and \"made their mark\".He didnt rate Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald. \"She sat on the far side of the chamber with the communist brigade. She was in the early stages of her career. I never thought she was someone who would go far,\" he says.\"Her contributions were mediocre. She would now appear more capable than she came across then so maybe the European Parliament just wasnt her thing.\"The TUV leader didnt warm to then EU Commissioner Lord Mandelson who was his \"usual aloof self\".Allisters time as an MEP was dominated by the Lisbon Treaty which he had strenuously opposed.\"I stood up for British sovereignty but I was swimming against the tide.\"I saw Denmark, Holland and the Republic reject the Treaty but the EU wouldnt take no for an answer. Brussels bared its teeth and bludgeoned them into changing their minds.\"I was a dissident voice on the constitutional affairs committee against the encroaching bureaucracy. Its a role with which Im entirely comfortable,\" he adds.Lord KilclooneyLord John Kilclooney was a UUP MEP from -. He would often invite high-profile MEPs to Northern Ireland. Danish parliamentarian Kent Kirk, who invaded British fishing waters in his boat in , came to meet the fishermen in Annalong, Kilkeel and Portavogie.Kilclooneys most famous guest was Austrian MEP Otto von Habsburg, a devout Catholic who had helped eject Paisley from the parliament after he challenged the pope. \"I took Otto to meet Cardinal O Fiach in Armagh,\" Lord Kilclooney recalls.\"We arrived in an RUC car. OFiach came down the marble staircase totally overdressed in his full regalia.\"It was am and he said to Otto Will have you a wee one  I said Well just have coffee and OFiach replied What kind of an Irishman are you \"As the UK bids au revoir to the EU, Northern Irelands -year relationship with Brussels comes to a close. When politics at home was bitter, it was usually dferent over there. We will all surely miss the colour, the controversy and, most of all, the characters."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast telegraph transfer test guide reveals scores accepted by every northern ireland school","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As a group, however, we do know that chameleons are one of Africa’s most threatened reptiles.“These tiny hatchlings will grow to be just three inches in . At the moment, they’re being cared for in our special, behind-the-scenes rearing facilities.“The new clutch will play a vital role in establishing a new breeding programme… This will allow us to create a sustainable population and help gather new information about the species that has previously been unavailable to us, helping us play a key role in preventing the extinction of chameleons and other reptiles in the future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"wigan schedule pride day for fixture against folaus catalans dragons","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Football clubs, Brooke Park Bowling Club, users of the fitness suite, youth groups and dog walkers from the local community aired their views at a public meeting yesterday evening. It was chaired by People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin and council officials were on hand to provide a response to any queries. Independent councillors Gary Donnelly and Sean Carr were in attendance as well as SDLP Councillor Mary Durkan. Mr Harkin began by saying that Derry City  Strabane District Council must be more “transparent” about its plans for the site as there had been rumours circulating that the old leisure centre may be demolished to make way for parking facilities. googletag.cmd.push Dalton Kehoe, of Rosemount Resource Centre, said speculation had emerged that a new centre may be built at the old Foyleville Day centre. Issues verbalised at the meeting centred around the top section of Brooke Park which includes the leisure centre, G and grass pitches and parking facilities. They included the need for additional changing facilities for the outdoor pitches, proper maintenance of those pitches, the need for new equipment in the gym and the possibility of reduced prices for community groups. The prospect of increased opening hours to bring the park in line with tier one facilities such as Templemore Sports Complex and Foyle Arena was also to council officials. googletag.cmd.push Rosemount residents also highlighted concerns around excessive dog fouling in the park and the need to fine those responsible. A recent letter from football coach, Paul Roddy, fast-tracked the meeting which had originally been scheduled last October but was pushed back due to Westminster elections. Speaking at the meeting, Head of Community Development at Derry City  Strabane District Council Barry O’Hagan recognised that errors have been made in the past and that Brooke Park Leisure Centre should have been consolidated on one site. He added that to increase opening hours, to purchase extra equipment and offer concessions for youth groups would have to be paid for somehow, and would likely lead to increased rates. Mr O’Hagan went on to say that he and other council officials are happy to speak to community groups to take on board their grievances. He made it clear that no decision has been made to close the old leisure centre but recognised that upgrades are required. Mr Roddy said that groups which have used the facilities for years have been left out in the cold. He said the standard of facilities in Derry wouldn’t be accepted in Belfast or Magherafelt where his team recently played. “They would laugh at us, it’s ridiculous.” He believes that the grass pitch should be at intermediate standard with dug outs and a standing area for supporters and suggested that council needs to be more pro-active in terms of development. One service user said that people have left Brooke Park to train where because of the reduced weekend opening hours. He had asked about the possibility of Brooke Park opening earlier and was ignored, but he said when Templemore temporarily closed, its users were accommodated at Brooke Park and it opened earlier. Cllr Donnelly said that was unacceptable and suggested a proposal could be brought before the council to bring opening times at tier two facilities in line with tier one centres. It was agreed that a motion could be brought before the council about Brooke Park facilities but that the community must be fully consulted beforehand with another public meeting organised shortly to allow more people to have their say.

Carpooling is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car and prevents the need for others to have to drive to a location themselves. Advantages are plentul, the reduced number of cars on the road is more environmentally friendly, it eases traffic congestion, travel costs are shared with other riders and it reduces stress by allowing you to read, listen to music, or relax when youre not driving. In addition, it saves time, prolongs the le of your vehicle and allows you to meet new people. googletag.cmd.push Millions of people car share across Europe but there is a reluctance to do so in Ireland and Britain. Well-travelled Spaniard, Venancio Calero moved to Derry two years ago from Alicante in Spain. He gained a PhD in Physics from a French university and now works as an engineer at Seagate Technology. His passion in le is travelling and he has moved around the world, residing in several European countries. In his view, there is a missed opportunity in Derry for carpooling, Venancio explained: “I am trying to promote a non-profit initiative for carpooling around the city. “Carpooling is something that I really miss from the countries I have lived before Spain, France, Germany and Poland, and I think in Derry it could be really convenient especially when connecting to the centre and west of Ireland. googletag.cmd.push “However, the available pages here are really mis-used, and it would be greatDerry would focus on one and find the travel offers there and the people start to try carpooling. The name of the page is ‘Northwest Carpooling’. “Ive published on some pages and groups across Derry, it has got some audience, but still not enough to really connect to people and get their trust.” He added: “I think that Derry misses big opportunities since the standard carpooling sites are not being used and the travel offers on those sites are negligible. “For me, it is a pity since without car it is sometimes dficult to reach most of the cities or towns around Ireland on a short travel time. It sometimes becomes even double the time with the current offers. “A centralised carpooling site for Derry would make mobility much easier across Northern Ireland, but also will ease the travelling to the centre and the west south-west of Ireland. “I find that carpooling is also the best way to travel for those who like to socialise and have to make long trips with their own cars, in addition to save travel costs and makes mobility more efficient for the environment. “I’m hoping that people from Derry will give attention to carpooling, start to share their trips and it will start to become a popular way to travel around. I think Derry could also become a good hub for carpooling and reaching the city from dferent locations will be much easier than it is now.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Evidence provided by a senior departmental official to Stormonts Economy Committee revealed the full extent of “dficulties” facing Ulster University in the development of its Belfast campus. Heather Cousins from the Department for the Economywas questioned about problems with the Belfast campus by MLAs on the committee. Ulster Universityhas requested a loan of poundm from DfE to complete its Belfast campus. The NI Audit Office had previously said the final cost was expected to be poundm over budget. googletag.cmd.push It emerged that overspend at the Belfast campus would now impact on commitments made in the New Decade New Approach document to expand UU’s Magee campus to , students. Latest figures available show the campus has , students, , of which are full-time. Speaking at the meeting, SDLP MLA for Foyle, Sinead McLaughlin, said a business case for overall Magee expansion aimed at attracting , full-time students has been submitted but Ms Cousins informed her that it has expired and a new one is required. The meeting was told that UU was asked for it last year but its council was not in a position to provide it and Ms Cousins said the major capital project in Belfast will have to be delivered before anything  happens. googletag.cmd.push In response, Mrs McLaughlin commented: “You’re saying quite categorically that a new business case is required for the expansion of Magee because the business case is not fit for purpose nor do you have confidence in their ability to deliver it at this time.” When told that summary was correct in the “short-term”, Mrs McLaughlin added: “What is short-term to you  Because in Derry we’ve been waiting sixty years for this.” Ms Cousins again stated that an updated business case must be submitted as the current one “doesn’t stack up”. The “very out-of-date” case amounted to poundm in capital funding and poundm resource “that we just do not have and unless there’s new money it’s hard to see how that will happen because when there is new money it goes to health and schools.” There is no “skills balance” in the country, the SDLP representative argued, as it is all centred around the East. “We need all of NI to work, therefore our skills strategy and funding and resources need to be put to good use throughout NI.”  ‘Stringent conditions’ Mrs McLaughlin also asked about the review of further and higher education and MaSN places. At present, NI’s higher education system’s capacity is managed through the maximum student numbercontrol mechanism, under which the number of full-time undergraduate students at each institution is restricted. The DfE official indicated thatthere were full fees then a cap on student numbers would not be needed. Universities are given a total number of places and it is up to them how they are distributed. There are “stringent conditions” in place for Ulster University to pay back the public funds. The amount is so high because the university got into “dficulties” and assurances are needed that that it will manage its finances in future, Ms Cousins explained. As part of the business case put forward there was a report that showed the vulnerability of UU’s finances in general. Ulster University Belfast is now running to a revised schedule of  when it will be complete with a projected overspend of poundm – that will be drawn down over two years. UU must then repay that loan. It will be under “closer scrutiny” but because universities are autonomous bodies they are responsible for the management of their projects. “The measures that we’re putting in place now are because of the dficulties that they’ve got in to which also impacts on their financial stability and as a department we are more concerned with their financial stability than anything  which is why we are recommending the additional loan and conditions attached to it,” Ms Cousins said. She went on to say that UU has to demonstrate its financial sustainability and capability of its council and senior management. Oversight The meeting was told that the department was aware that things were going wrong in the past year. It was not receiving regular reports and the university council was not getting information. UU did not ask for assistance until recently when business cases were produced. DfE has confidence that an appropriate project director is in place but caveated that by saying it is “not without risk” because “fit out and IT” costs are still needed. Independent MLA Claire Sugden said there should have been better oversight to ensure the project didn’t run so badly over-budget. Revealing it is unprecedented, Ms Cousins said there have been major capital projects at both universities and the department has never taken these steps before. In answer to another question from Ms Sugden, she said UU provided medical school business case but were required to provide an additional case on the medical workforce which is not yet completed. Until that’s done the department of health can’t make recommendations about the medical school. Sinn Feacutein MLA John O’Dowd also pointed out that it would now cost poundm rather than poundm which was the projected overall cost stated in committee members’ documents and questioned why the university had been given additional leeway.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Here is a player by player look at Magherafelts performance. Peter McKinney – It was a third clean sheet in five competitive games and this one was well earned. His save from Tiernan Kierans was one of the main reasons why they won. His handling was top notch, he saved two earlier efforts and kicked intelligently. Finn Diamond – Missed the win over Cavan but was a welcome ee to the St Marys defence. Was given the job of picking up Niall McKenna. While the Monaghan man notched three points from play, Diamond added to the Magherafelt attack with his runs forward. He played the pass for McElhennons point. googletag.cmd.push Matthew McNeill – Went up against Lochlainn Power. He did have help from Eoin McEvoy but he held the Macartans man scoreless. Got forward, used the ball well and was imposing in the air. Made a brilliant block to deny Power and really stepped up in extra-time. Shea McSorley – Picked up Michael Hamill initially who mainly played deep and it left McSorley to sweep back in front of the defenceanyone  attacked. Was perfectly positioned to pick up a breaking ball from the last Monaghan high ball pumped in, hoping to engineer a late goal. Eoin McEvoy – Played as the sweeper against the wind in the first-half to close down the space but still got forward when he could. Was positioned more in the wing back area in the second-half and had a huge role in Magherafelts comeback including an inspirational effort when they trailed by three points. googletag.cmd.push Conleth Mallon – Gave away height to Conor McCooey before he eventually dropped off to play deeper. He had to find the balance between getting forward. Playing at wing-forward in the second-half. Saw plenty of possession, rarely wasted it and kicked an important score. Johnny McErlain – Started at centre-back and with McEvoy behind, it allowed him to hold the middle and push forward to midfield. In extra-time, he played as the sweeper and his presence never gave Monaghan a snf of the goal they needed to save the game. His long ball led to Kevin McNicholls point. POLL Who was tour man of the match  Click here... Aidan McCluskey – Began at wing-back on Darragh Treanor but morphed into a more central role as the game wore on. Was off-target from frees but always had the courage to have a go. Never shirked the responsibility. His point levelled matters mid-way through the second-half. Eunan Quinn – Started at midfield on Dylan Ballantine. Had a strong first-half where he won kick-outs and presented himself for the pass coming from defence. Struggled to impose himself in the second-half and was replaced with  minutes remaining. Dan Higgins – He took his goal with the composure of a veteran. Only for a last ditch tackle, he couldve added a second in the next play. Put himself about well at midfield and was able to get forward to add a point. He won McErlains high ball in lead-up to McNicholls point and set-up Callum Ormsby for the clinching second goal. Eunan McElhennon – Sliced over a classy score, into the breeze, to get the Convent off the mark. He was a brilliant link man in the counter-attacking side of their game. He was always looking to get involved in the play and made an inch-perfect interception when the result hung in the balance. Ryan McKenna – It was his kick that handed Magherafelt the passport to Clones and he once again delivered when the pressure was on. Missed a few chances and did a lot on unselfish running to get on the ball. With his teams hopes resting on this shoulders, he slotted over the th minute equaliser to force extra-time. Sean Duffin – Played much of the game at wing-forward where he won a dficult possession that led to Conleth Mallons first-half point. Found it more dficult to get on the ball in the second-half and was replaced by Callum Ormsby. Conhuir Johnston – He may only be in Year  but he certainly didnt show it. Played up front with Kevin McNicholl and led the line. St Marys began extra-time on the front foot and his confident strike put them ahead on their way to victory. Kevin McNicholl – Lost the first two balls to Ronan Boyle but continued to show and proved to be an effective ball winner. Always took the right option, was comfortable on the ball and was rewarded with a point during Magherafelts purple match in the final quarter. SUBS Callum Ormsby – Came in for Sean Duffin and emphatically hammered home the second Magherafelt goal. Ryan McEldowney – Brought on for Eunan Quinn and was unlucky to miss a chance to level the game before McKennas last gasp heroics in normal time. Caolan Crozier – Replaced Kevin McNicholl at half-time in extra-time and gave fresh legs. Joe McVey – Played the last  minutes after coming in for Ronan McKenna. Conor Fowley – A stoppage time replacement for Shea McSorley. MATCH REPORT - St Marys - St Macartans -. Click here...

It’s not an easy thing to do but the plan is on February  and  from pm to pm in the Nerve Centre there will be a photography exhibition, short film showcases and, obviously, a gig. The event will be a creative arts festival following the completion of the Education Authority’s CADi scheme that provides young people with qualications and key skills in the creative arts such as film, live sound, photography, graphic design and events management. Live sound is underlined because, obviously, it’s the most important thing in the world.The festival will contain an exhibition of photography, showcase of short films and two days of music including  bands highlighting the musical talent throughout Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Megan Watton and Oisin Clenaghan. This celebration of youth culture has been completely organised by the young people involved with the CADi project to showcase youth within the arts. This should be just about enough to keep the adults interested.Featured acts include Villa in FranceGrace Mullan,Vanilla Days, Meeks, Wasted Wild,Juno Hasson and Aimee Tourish, a bit of trad from Jordan Lively and songstress Maya Patterson, all who have been paving their way through the music scene across the north coast and Derry and in recent months.I spoke to one of the organisers, Megan Watton, and first asked what does CADi mean and what made you all want to do it in the first place  “Well, I joined three years ago it stands for Creative And Digital Innovation.“The course is one year and you get an OCN level one, two or three, depending on what age you are which is the equivalent to an A level or GCSE. “I, personally, wanted to do it because it would give me new skills and quality’s I could use in the future. It has been a programme run by the education Authority for three years and the numbers grow each year The Nerve Centre has been a fantastic help as they provide the tutors of each discipline events management, film, photography, graphic design and sound.They also have connections in the music scene which helps when booking bands,” she added. “Just that this programme has aided so many young people with their mental health and self-confidence and the out of school conditions helps. Without CADiI wouldn’t have gotten into my tech course.” Ethan Martin, who also helped organise it, said: “CADi means working with others in a small group to achieve the same goal. It’s been hard as we had to learn how to run an event, the Nerve Centre has been a huge help.”Events manager team member Clodagh McKenna, said: “The CADi Youth Takeover is an event for young people by young people. “It’s a chance to show how talented the youth of Northern Ireland is particularly in its music scene which has so many hidden gems. It also contains amazing work from the photographers, and film makers from the CADi programme.“CADi is a cross community programme aimed to give young people aged - the opportunity to gain skills in areas they wouldn’t usually get an opportunity to within school. “These include photography, graphic design, live sound , film and events management. The bulk of the programme consists of three residential weekends which lead up to the final event.“We’ve worked hard over the past couple of months to produce an event we hope the public will love. CADi really is like a second family to lots of us and you can see that when we come together. “We’ve created friends and memories that will last a letime.” AdultMarty Coyle said: “The CADi courses are a fantastic opportunity for young people to get some real-le experience in arts related subjects whilst gaining a qualication at the same time. “The upcoming two-day event at Nerve Centre will showcase the hard work they have put in throughout the course, showcase their own work as well as presenting a broad demographic of their peers within the arts throughout Northern Ireland”.

I got this cold off all the little two and three year olds in nursery, not that I actually wanted it you understand. Of course I understand we can’t keep our children off nursery because of a snfle, butthey’ve a proper cold with coughs, sneezes and that yucky green stuff it means they are not well - not well enough to be in nursery. For just as I didn’t want this cold neither did they, but because a few decided to come in with their nasty cold germs, with the yucky green stuff, we’ve now all had it - thanks. googletag.cmd.push Of course, I understand this is not the children’s fault but, and sorry to say, it is down to those few parents who think ‘go to nursery however snotty and yucky you may be’. So I’m writing this article, for a few reasons, the first to say please do keep your child off nursery they aren’t well, it’s no fun for them and no fun for anyone  when they get the bug too. I know le can be hard with a sickly child, I know how much we need that break sometimes but please, please keep your bugs at home. googletag.cmd.push My next reason is to share with you some tips, ideas and thoughts that I’ve heard and used over the years to help with coughs, cold’s and sneezes, please do remember though I am not a doctor soyou decide to use one of these ideas that I’m passing along to you then do check with a pharmacist or doctor that is is okay to do this with your baby, toddler and  or child. . DO make your child wear a vest or t-shirt under their jumper. Believe me I have met a few children this winter who just wear t-shirts, and always look and feel cold, winter clothes are for winter and summer clothes for summe.!  . TEACH your toddler how to blow through their nose, yes literally show them how to blow, this makes runny noses so much easier to manage. Yes of course you have to hold the tissue for them, butthey can blow then that means less of the runny stuff.  . DO put a little vaseline around their noses when your little one has a cold - this stops their nose getting sore, but also makes it sooo much easier to wipe. . Do keep this little pot of vaseline just for their nose though. . TREAT, some people do use medicines, paracetamol, baby Sudafed etc and this is a personal choice, it’s up to you as parents. But as my mum said, ‘with medicine the cold will be there a week, without medicine it’ll be there for a week’. The medicines are designed to make your little one feel better, they won’t necessarily cure the cold. Remember you know your child best, whether this be they need a little something, or an appointment at the doctor.  . WHEN your little one goes to nursery do pack a spare outfit including socks, shoes or wellies and trousers - not for toilet accidents but because it is till nice to play outside but it can be wet or muddy and it is not nice to sit about later in damp clothes.  . HELP your two and three year olds learn how to blow their nose AND put the tissue in the bin not back in the box- it is a skill and does need practise but the sooner they learn the more comfortable they feel. . TEMPERATURE, a normal temperature in babies and children is about .C but this can y slightly. A fever is usually considered to be a temperatureof C or above’ . It is handy to have a thermometer at home for these worrying times - do ask for advice from a pharmacist about which is best to buy and easiest to use. But always be mindful of your little one’s temperaturethey are poorly - and especially mindful with babies.  . PLEASE don’t wipe their nose with kitchen roll - this can make it sore, use tissues with balm in them - yes I know they can be more expensive but bargain shops do great deals.Be careful wiping noses with wet wipes as some can sting - soft tissues and vaseline don’t! . EXTRA, sometimes people use a vapour, like Vicks, to rub onto their baby, toddler or child’s chest, or feet, these can be soothing when applied to the body but you can also get them as a humidier, or as an oil to pop in the bath - it’s up to you to choose what is right for your little one. Please do be aware that there are age restrictions on them and not all are suitable for all ages.  . DO make your child wear a coat and a hat for very cold weather and maybea scarf and glovesit’s very chilly.  . DON’T force your child to eat too muchthey are poorly, little and often is best, snotty noses can often lead to sickly tummy’s, but do make sure they are getting plenty of fluids so they do not become dehydrated, water, water and more water or failing that juice. . . EVEN though it’s cold outside and your little may be full of cold sometimes a walk in the fresh air for a short time can help - fresh air can make you feel better and help your little one sleep better too - just remember to wrap up warm.  . DO encourage your little one to eat lots of vegetables and fruit, all the time not just when they have a cold, these are full of vitamins that will help them to develop a good immune system. Fingers crossed these few little things help, good luck fighting the cold bug. Atishooooo!

From its small beginnings with a staggered intake of children in  the school has now grown to over  pupils,  teachers and  classroom assistants. Everyone has a part to play.

Despite the many additional pressures being placed upon them in recent years, the children in their care are still their number one concern and they do all in their power to ensure that their experiences are happy, secure and educationally fruitful. googletag.cmd.push And whilst it is not all about academic results the number of children that go on to post primary grammar schools is amazing.

Police stopped the vehicle and Farrell said I put my hands up. The court also heard that Farrell had ben detected driving at mph,  miles over the limit, on June . Defence solicitor Paddy MacDermott said that police had told the defendant thatit were not for the fact the road was quiet he would have been charged with dangerous driving. googletag.cmd.push He said Farrells child was sick and he was going to get Calpol. Describing it as a very stupid piece of driving, Mr MacDermott said that Farrells licence was essential to him. Deputy District Judge Alan White said: mph is just beyond the pale. I am always willing to give a chance to people who break the law but anyone who drives at this outrageous speed has to be disqualied.

He is a former member of the cathedral choir and was also a member of the choir at St Annersquos Cathedral in Belfast.He says his love of cathedrals began when he attended a service in St Maryrsquos Episcopal Cathedral in Glasgow while training to become a social worker.ldquoI just loved everything about it mdash the service, the music, the atmosphere. It all made sense, he explains.Cliversquos cathedral tour coincided with another long standing ambition mdash to play every golf course in Ireland. Travelling by camper van, hersquos played  courses to date and also written a book about it.Clive is at pains to point out that he didnrsquot just visit the cathedrals mdash he also attended a service in every one of them. Asked which was hisfavourite, he is undecided, though some stand out more than others.ldquoThe cathedrals are so dferent, so itrsquos dficult to say which was the nicest or the most impressive. I really liked some of the small ones, such as in Trim, Co Meath, Ferns in Co Waterford and Raphoe in Donegal, he says.ldquoThe bigger ones, such as in Kilkenny and Kildare, were very impressive and I really liked the visit to Rosscarbery Cathedral in Co Cork.ldquoKilmore Cathedral outside Cavan town is also lovely. Itrsquos the only building in sight and is tucked away in the trees. There was a large congregation, including around  children.At Killala Cathedral in Mayo, Clive met up with Archdeacon Stephen McWhirter, an old friend from his Scouting days.Clive says his visit to Cashel in October was memorable for another reason. ldquoI had emailed in advance explaining that I had visited all the Church of Ireland cathedrals in Ireland and asked them for the time of the service. When we got there we were treated like royalty.Cliversquos fascination with cathedrals isnrsquot limited to Ireland.

victory at Bear Park.In a surprisingly entertaining game, both teams had half chances in the first few minutes with Olympicrsquos Damian Travers and Dylan McCartan unable to get shots on target.Forest should have taken the lead in the ninth minute when a Paul Kane corner kick was only cleared as far as Philly Flood, and his cross just evaded Ray Kendall who was sliding in at the back post.This was to be Floodrsquos last meaningful contribution to the game as he went over on his ankle and had to be replaced by McKibbin, with Jennings ping into left back.Tollymore started with almost the same team that was beaten last week with the exception of Paul Devlin, who was making his debut, and Mooney, Flood, and Paul Kane who were all unavailable last week.However, it was Devlin that made the dference in the first  minutes.The midfielder almost opened the scoring after  minutes when his sizzling free kick from the edge of the penalty area warmed the hands of lsquokeeper Dean Blackwood with Paul Kane heading the loose ball wide.Moments later a huge clearance from Tollymore lsquokeeper Imrie bounced over the Olympic defence, and Rory Walsh jumped with Blackwood only to see his header go wide of the target.Just as it seemed neither team was going to score, Devlin hit a wonder goal from  yards, with the power and swerve of the shot leaving Blackwood flat-footed.With the wind at their backs Tollymore stepped things up and in the th minute an astute pass from Kane picked out Rory Walsh who hit the Olympic crossbar.Devlin was replaced at half-time by Marty McCourt for his first game since early September, and while the big man looked rusty, he soon picked up the pace of the game.Both sides had half chances before Forest doubled their advantage in the th minute when a through ball from Kane saw Walsh nipping in behind the Olympic defence.The unlucky Stephen McConnell barged Walsh in the back with the striker tumbling into the advancing lsquokeeper and referee Mullan had no hesitation in awarding a sport kick.Paul Kane stepped up to take the penalty and lsquoThe Generalrsquo made no mistake to score his second goal in two games.Forest now started to take control and a terric run from James Jennings saw Maxwell and McConnell combining well to scramble the ball clear.In the st minute Walsh made the score - when he ran onto a pass from Marty McCourt to shoot past Blackwood.Forest replaced Kane with Matt McCormick and the young striker almost scored immediately, but was denied by an excellent save from Blackwood whose out-stretched leg prevented a certain goal.In the th minute McCormick did find the net after some excellent approach play from Burkowski.Moments later a superb run from Olympicrsquos Thomas Rogers almost ended with a deserved goal, but his shot flashed over the Forest crossbar.A good performance from Tollymore that resulted in a deserved win, but can they repeat the performance this weekend as consistency is whatrsquos important Best for Tollymore were James Jennings and a remarkable first half performance from Paul Devlin, but in truth it was a good team performance.Match sponsor: Diamond Patrsquos, Newcastle.Tollymore Forest Ballynahinch Olympic III NEWCASTLE LEAGUE DIVISION .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 Flagship.jpg","title":"Flagship Festival of Flight set to return  ","story":"IT has been confirmed that the Festival of Flight will be ing to Newcastle in June.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos flagship tourist event will take place on Saturday, June .This festival, which comprises exciting displays both on and off the ground is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors to the resort.It has not yet been confirmedthe RAF Red Arrows display team will be taking part.The Festival of Flight is part of the councilrsquos lsquoGiant Adventuresrsquo programme of events which was announced this week.They include Wake the Giant in Warrenpoint in August, and Footsteps in the Forest in Slieve Gullion Forest Park.The Councilrsquos tourism programme will also include the DownTime Festival in Downpatrick from June -, the Strangford Lough Skfie Festival from July -August , and the Strangford Lough and the Narnia Festival in Kilbroney Park, Rostrevor, from November -.Council chairman Charlie Casey said: ldquoThese flagship festivals are key events in our programme of tourism events.ldquoWe are very pleased that the Festival of Flight, Wake the Giant and Footsteps in the Forest are all scheduled toto our district in .ldquoThese festivals act as a catalyst to inspire visitors to visit our area.

It has been downgraded to a Type II emergency unit which we believe is not sufficient. The Downe was only one of two hospitals in the past  years which had had its needs fully assessed before it was built.ldquoThere is a clearly established case for a -hour emergency service in Downpatrick operating seven days a week and nothing has happened at the Department of Health or anywhere  to suggest otherwise. Service changes were made in the past due to staffing issues, nothing .Mr McGrady also revealed that changes are planned at the Downe with surveyors visiting the hospital recently to examine where the proposed new MRI scanner will be located.He said the provision of the scanner will result in an extension being built and also open the door to allow the hospital to do so much more in terms of diagnostics and other opportunities,Campaigners also insisted at last weekrsquos meeting that space is needed to reopen  beds closed in the same week of the new Downersquos official opening in , highlighting the need for everyone mdash including politicians and Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash to work together on this particular issue and that it was time for the ldquoinjustices of the past in terms of local health care provision to be addressed.Mrs Anne Trainor highlighted the lack of investment in local hospital services in the past and said it was time that the Downe Hospital was firmly on the ldquolips of the decision makers and that the local area got its fair share of funding.Looking to the future, she saidthe Downe does become a centre of excellence for the elderly, this will pave the way for other new services to add to those already in place.She also backed calls for more beds to be provided in the Downpatrick hospital and is keen to see the local council taking an active role on health and working alongside campaigners.ldquoHealth is the single most important issue and we have been hammering home this message for years, she declared.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council needs to play a serious role in the delivery of healthcare. The former Down Council put its hands in its pocket to help the hospital campaign but its successor has been lacking in this regard.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoWe want a fully ing hospital that provides this community with the services it needs.

In addition to her work with children, Laura is also keen to show her support for the work carried out by the charity.Explaining the nature of her work, Laura said that it centres around helping children deal with emotional behavioural problems through play.She has a dedicated toolkit to help which includes sand trays, miniature toys, stuffed toys, hand puppets and books containing therapeutic stories to help deliver the so-called Play  Grow project.A qualied play therapist who is registered with Play Therapy UK, Laura has been working with children since  and previously spent time working in Downpatrick where she did her voluntary placement with Action for Children based at the Ballymote Centre.She explained that the opportunity to set up her new service came about as a result of her volunteering work with Le Change Changes Lives, with her work focusing on children aged between four and .ldquoI work with children who have emotional behavioural problems, those dealing with bereavement and loss or who have separated or orced parents, Laura continued.ldquoI also work with those who have anger of anxiety issues, those who may have become withdrawn, have communication problems or have suffered forms of abuse or nightmares. I also work with those who are being bullied or who are bullies themselves.Laura, who offers a free consultation with parents, said children can release their inner feelings through play.She explained that play is a childrsquos natural medium of self expression, highlighting the number of times children ask their parents to play with them and have a chat. Laura said children feel most comfortable in this environment.ldquoAs play is what children are comfortable with, it makes sense that you would use this method to help them through a dficult time. This is particularly effective for children who cannot or who do not want to talk about their problems.ldquoThey can play out their feelings and problems anda child wants to talk to me here of course they can do that. Some children say that they do not want to talk about whatever trauma is in their lives and I say to them that is great because they do not have to.ldquoHowever, they will still express those feelings through play and may in fact not be aware that this is what they are doing. The metaphor is very powerful in the play therapy room and children can hide behind a mask to demonstrate their feelings and using a puppet is a very good example of that.Laura said her work is a method of helping children with behavioural and emotional problems to help themselves, explaining that is the children do all the work.ldquoI am just here as a facilitator, she said. ldquoPlay therapy is not always fun and sometimes the children will encounter dficult feelings. I adopt a child-centred approach where the child leads the way and the therapist follows which is non directive.ldquoOne of the most important aspects of play therapy is the element of control. For some children when something has happened in their le or environment it is a thing which they cannot control which causes trauma. When they come here, this is the one place they can come in and say lsquoright we are doing this my wayrsquo and it can take back control.Laura described play therapy is ldquonon judgemental and said children know they are in a safe environment and can express themselves in any way in which they will be accepted or who they are.She added: ldquoThe children will learn that while here they can be themselves and they will feel comfortable to be themselves.Laura can be contacted on   or via her social media page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 New.jpg","title":"New minister at Lissara church  ","story":"A NEW chapter in the history of Lissara Presbyterian Church opened last weekend with the installation of the Rev Alan Burke.A large congregation attended last Friday eveningrsquos service in Crossgar with the new minister looking forward to his time working in the area.For the past two and a half years, Mr Burke was assistant minister at the Loanends and Killead churches near Aldergrove.

Rickety-looking lorries double as taxis with crowds of people clinging precariously atop a snappably-thin man transports a sofa on the back of his pushbike another has two live goats riding pillion. Images that could have been lted straight from the pages of National Geographic.Passing ramshackle towns and villages on pot-holed red-dirt roads, which turn to mud baths when it rains, we arrive at Ngora to meet Agnes, who is part of the Aingang Eidunyet Women’s group - the name translates as ‘Support your Neighbour’ and this is exactly what this collection of women are doing with the upmost wholeheartedness.The -strong group of female farmers, dressed beautully in resplendent blue dresses , welcome us effusively with singing, dancing hugs and infectious smiles. It is clear they are indebted to Self Help Africa for giving them the skills to flourish. In Uganda, women shoulder the primary responsibilities for childcare and play a central role in the agricultural sector, engaging in a myriad of ways as producers, labourers, marketers, and entrepreneurs. The Aingang Eidunyet Women’s group is just one of  collectives which Self Help Africa supports through training, education and financial assistance, for this is a region with a dark past and plenty of present challenges, not least climate change.The area is still recovering from the ravages inflicted by a brutal rebel movement, the Lord’s Resistance Army, led by Joseph Kony.In  the group sowed terror in northern Uganda, killing civilians and abducting and enslaving children to be rebel soldiers. Orangemen aim toscale Kilimanjaro Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"People fled their homes, taking refuge in squalid ‘protection camps’. Eithne McNulty, Self Help Africa NI’s overseas officer said: ‘‘People were in the camps for so many years, they were unskilled, disempowered and used to hand outs. They didn’t know how to work the land, didn’t know the boundaries of their land, didn’t know where their farms were, so they were coming back to all of that lack of structure and lack of any kind of authority.’’They were also dirt poor, many living on just p a day. The hunger season in the region can be as long as four or five months in some less fortunate communities, with March, April, May and part of June as the critical months. ‘‘It’s dry, you can’t plant anything, nothing can grow and food supplies are running short,’’ said Eithne.‘‘Our ambition is that during the hunger months people will have at least two meals a day. People are telling us that they will struggle during May and early June, the food supplies will have diminished. It’s been a bad year because of water logging, so they lost a lot of crops.’’As its name suggests, Self Help Africa is about educating people to become self sufficient. It has instigated ElumCentres - literally training centres for the group. These are hosted by one farmer in the group and they have demonstrations from Self Help Africa on how to save water, how to irrigate crops, how to grow a kitchen garden.‘‘There is no point in giving people seeds for their kitchen gardensthey don’t know what to do with them,’’ said Eithne.‘‘We spend a lot of time training the farmers on good agri-economic practices and good marketing practice. It’s about education, it’s about going in there to help build their capacity.’’Agnes has learnt so much from the charity she jokes she’s like a ‘‘schoolgirl’’.‘‘Formerly, we had lost hope, but when we came into a group, we are now very active, now we are doing things, we are very happy. It is good to share ideas with people. Now, I have everything, I have all the vegetables. I pick and cook.’’Other women in the group are eager to share their experiences and their successes.Harriet said before the formation of the group in  they were ‘‘badly off’’ in their families.‘‘Le was very dficult. This group has eased our le.’’Self Help Africa taught the women how to save their money, so that collectively, as a group, they have bought eight sheep with their savings, some have even bought cows for themselves. In the future they hope each member will each have her own sheep. Their food stores are plentul too, with a good supply of sorghumand ground nuts. Another farmer, Agwang, said: ‘‘Some of us did not have houses, some did not have any businesses for survival and some did not have mattresses, but now all the members have at least mattresses and most of the members have small-scale businessesthat we can survive on. Most of us have built houses. ‘‘Some of us can hire gardens that we can cultivate, sell the produce and get a living. Some of the crops can be retained for home consumption. We can now afford to put our children in school and plant trees.’’ Thanks to the intervention most households now also have toilets and a tap. The women have also been taught how to cook nutritious food for their families. The main crops grown in the region include sorghum, cassava, ground nuts, cow peas, sweet potatoes, maize and finger millet. All are at the mercy of climate change and pests and diseases .Denny Elliott, head, Self Help Africa NI, said: ‘‘The area will be scorched now for a few months, then the rains are meant to come, butthey don’t come and you’re trying to get ready for ploughing, there is no point opening land with the oxen we’ve given the communities,it isn’t going to rain.’’Each farming group is based on a five-committee model, which includes marketing, procurement, advocacy, monitoring and evaluation, and a village saving and loans association- which becomes a huge part of how people manage and survive.Eithne said: ‘‘The idea is that long after we are gone that structure will remain in the community and they will able to self-manage it’s almost like a mini co-operative. They appoint their own officers, they keep their own records.’’Gender-based violence is a huge problem in the region it is thought to affect one in two women. Self Help Africa has introduced a novel programme called Gender Action Learning Systemwhich aims to tackle the scourge.‘‘Self Help Africa focuses on empowering women because they are the future,’’ said Eithne.‘‘It’s been statistically and research-proven thatyou give resources to a woman, those resources will find their way inside the family household. If you give them to the man, it is much less likely that the children and the family will benefit.‘‘The GALS methodology works at the household level, with the woman and the man and together, they’ll plan what they’ll save, what they’ll borrow, how they will spend the borrowing. One of the welcome offshoots is that domestic violence is reduced because there is a much better understanding by the man of what exactly is happening within the family. It is a really powerful tool.’’The farmers I met in the Aingang Eidunyet Women’s group contend with insanely tough conditions, yet they are joyous, strong and entrepreneurial.

The first phase of Brexit will finish at pm tonight but the battle to secure trading arrangements which provide businesses here with ambidextrous market access begins in earnest.

It was Powell who monumentally overestimated his influence with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button When on  November  the treaty was signed in Hillsborough Castle, giving the Republic’s government for the first time a say in the internal affairs of Northern Ireland, Powell was stunned and bitter, denouncing Mrs Thatcher in the Commons as a Jezebel.Almost three and a half decades later, unionism again finds itself betrayed on a constitutional issue by a British Prime Minister who once boasted about his unionism.But there the comparison stops. This time unionism’s response has been radically dferent from that of Ian Paisley and Jim Molyneaux.The s attempts to boycott government, refuse to pay TV and dog licences and try to make councils ungovernable descended into farce while the street protests and ‘third force’ paramilitary organisations did more harm to unionism than they did to the Agreement.This time the DUP, which is far more dominant within unionism than the UUP was in , appears to have few ideas about how to undo damage which stems not only from a decision – Brexit – which it backed, but which comes in a period where Arlene Foster has had more power over the government than any other unionist leader since Edward Carson. While Powell believed he had the ear of the Prime Minister because of his intellect, ideological affinity with Margaret Thatcher and his deep roots in the Conservative Party, Mrs Foster relied on sheer political power for her influence.The DUP leader and many of her senior colleagues weren’t afraid to flaunt that power, humiliating Theresa May by forcing her to fly back from Brussels in December  when she was about to sign up to a deal which would involve Northern Ireland maintaining regulatory alignment with the EU in order to avoid a hard Irish border.Ultimately, Mrs May secured the insertion of a new paragraph to that key document – but even at the time it appeared to simply introduce ambiguity over whether Northern Ireland would in fact leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK.But another aspect of that Joint Report was nodded through by the DUP even though its implications were remarkable.Paragraph  contained a commitment from the UK to the avoidance of a hard border and then crucially for the first time defined a ‘hard border’ as “any physical infrastructure or related checks and control”. It was a sweeping definition which went far beyond the images which the phrase ‘hard border’ would conjure up for most people – customs posts, passport control, barbed wire and soldiers.‘Dawn of a new era’ as Brexit gets doneBrexiteers at Stormont sing God Save the Queen as clock strikes  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"So sweeping was the definition that it went beyond the dictionary definition of ‘hard border’ – and also meant that the current arrangements at the border, where cameras are already in place at key locations, is a ‘hard border’, something most people would regard as absurd.That lack of attention to detail was reminiscent of Mrs Foster’s approach to RHI and on its own would have been deeply problematic.However, it was accompanied by behaviour from some of her colleagues which undermined the party’s interests.Several months earlier, in February , senior DUP figure Nelson McCausland was dismissive of the implications of his support for Brexit, saying of the post-Brexit border: “I wouldn’t care what sort of situation I face as long as I’m out of Europe”.Less than a year later,North Antrim MP Ian Paisley Jr boasted that the Joint Report – which was riddled with ambiguities and bear pits – meant that the DUP had “done over” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.In a statement, the arch-Brexiteer accepted that the document was “imperfect”, but went on to claim that as a result of what had been agreed Northern Ireland “has not been designated some purgatorial relationship of neither being in our outside the EU but will be treated completely the same as every other component part of the UK”.With what even at the time appeared unwise bragging, he said: “Frankly, whatever efforts are made to characterise this week Leo Varadkar was done over by the EU, the UK and the DUP.”Talking bullishly about the possibility of the UK quitting the EU without a deal, the North Antrim MP said that should “put the fear of the almighty into the Republic” which would see its economy “crippled”.The absence of any humility in what Mr Paisley mistakenly believed was his moment of triumph was typical of how many in the DUP have a tendency to swagger when they think they are on top. Not all in the party exhibit this characteristic and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was among those who overwhelmingly adopted a more measured tone, perhaps realising that the hubris of some of his colleagues had become – and remains – a strategic liability.A lack of sympathy at the DUP’s plight, extended to schadenfreude in some cases, meant that when the party had a valid concern it found few open ears. Ultimately Boris Johnson, who they enabled to become Prime Minister, came to support the UK leaving in a way which creates a trade border – the extent of which is still unclear – in the Irish Sea.He proposed that Stormont would approve that arrangement by a simple majority vote, rather than allowing both unionism and nationalism to each have a veto, as envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement. That gave the DUP the chance to argue that this was a profoundly problematic abandonment of the principle that Northern Ireland cannot operate as a majoritarian society. But, having thrown about its weight for more than two years, the party found few willing to listen to its concerns.There has been some evidence in recent weeks of the DUP softening its rhetoric and last night Arlene Foster attempted to make a conciliatory gesture by travelling to Dublin to be interviewed on The Late Late Show. But while tone can be changed to suit circumstances, the more alarming issue for some unionists will be the lack of attention to detail which has consistently marked Mrs Foster’s approach to Brexit.Having backed Brexit on a whim without even the pretence of having considered its practical implications, and in the face of warnings from other unionists that it could tear apart the Union, there is still no evidence of humility, still less contrition, from the DUP leader.But regardless of Mrs Foster’s future, the events of the last four years have wrought a legacy which will linger.The Union has been, perhaps irreversibly, undermined.And not only have soft nationalists and many centrist voters been enraged, pushing them towards Irish unity, but there has been a deep imprint left on many unionists. Overwhelmingly, they do not support Irish unity, something which shows how great the task of nationalism will be to persuade them in a future border poll.But, yet again, they have had their faithin a British government shattered. Even within the DUP, some were so stunned by Boris Johnson’s betrayal that it caused them to question the value of the Union itself.In myriad senses, Brexit has loosened the ties that bind Northern Ireland to Great Britain – and none of those responsible are yet prepared to accept their role in that.try catch  TrendingAlastair Stewart tweet: Julia Nightingale pays tribute to ITV news presenter forced to step down after social media error of judgementNI snow alert: Heavy snowfall expected overnight - temperature to feel a bitterly cold -degCNI snow  ice alert: Hour-by-hour NI weather forecast for duration of Met Office yellow status weather warningStephen Nolan challenges everyone to join him in weight loss challenge afterdisappointment of putting weight back on remains profoundMan stabbed in face - PSNI deny tongue cut from mouth after gruesome image appears on social media        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Politics\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and travel","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

There looks to be a change around mid-month to milder conditions, although the timing is very uncertain.\"This change looks likely to bring milder and wetter conditions across most parts of the UK, allowing temperatures to recover to around average, or perhaps slightly above.\"The wettest conditions are likely to be in the north and west, with an increased likelihood of drier spells in the south and southeast.\"Colder interludes are still possible.\"There have only been four occasion in the UK in the last  years where more than  per cent of stations in the UK reported snow on the ground at am.After -cm of snow fell in the Highlands and mph winds occurred on the Welsh Coast a few weeks ago, bookmakers started offering odds on snowfall in a number of cities across the UK.However, betting odds have now changed, suggesting snow is less likely to fall in the UK this Christmas.A spokesman for William Hill said: \"At this stage of the year, the odds always suggest that a White Christmas is a long shot.\"Its - against snow in Aberdeen on Christmas Day, - against snow in Glasgow, - against snow in Edinburgh, and - snow in Newcastle.London is -.According to long range weather forecaster Exacta Weather, there could be blizzards on Christmas Day followed by a freezing cold January. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

The UKrsquos withdrawal from the EU will begin later this month and we have a Conservative Government in Westminster until at least .Regardless of the numbers in the Commons, the Labour Party still has to stand up for those we represent. I am confident that my colleague, Stephen Doughty MP will continue to do that.The Labour Party will now move to elect a new Leader and Deputy Leader, a chance to reunite the Party and hold the Prime Minister to account for his actions.I am truly glad to see that several MPs from across the Party have put their names forward to stand for both positions. This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/JM.jpg","title":"were in for another busy year ahead","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Are we in, or out  By the time you’re reading this, the UK is likely to be – from a technical perspective at least – about to leave the EU, and go it alone.In the four weeks or so since the last edition of the magazine, we’ve had a strong Tory majority pushing Brexit over the line and the restoration of devolution after three years without elected officials on the Hill. As we enter a new year and decade, there’s a sense, or a hope, of ato some form of normalised business environment. Brexit isn’t what business wanted, speaking generally, but it appears it’s what we’ve got. The minutiae of trading arrangements are still not worked out. Some sectors are more content than others, but we shouldn’t forget that Northern Ireland had a previous withdrawal deal on the table – largely backed by business – little over a year ago which could have set us apart as a unique trading environment, maintaining strong links with the Republic and the wider EU marketplace. But some of those in the political sphere seemingly put their own self interest and ideology above the future of the economy, and those who live in it. Tonight, some will take to the streets in and around the heart of the UK Government to show to the world their joy – perhaps misplaced – over the exit from the EU. For some, purely from a nationalistic perspective, its a chance to satisfy all the cliches that have plagued us over the last three years or so and for others, a chance to revel in an perceived brave new world – forged and fuelled by thoughts of a rose-tinted Britain gone by, Crystal Palace, heaving smoke stacks, heavy industry and fish and chips served up in newspaper on a pebble beach. For Northern Ireland business, and many people here, much of that platonic ideal is dficult to comprehend – especially among a younger generation. You just have to look at the breakdown in demographic of voters in the last General Election to see that. For some, tonight will be a time to mourn. Leaving the largest trading bloc in the world and, for better or worse, going it alone. Regardless, tomorrow and after the transition period in less than a years time, the hard work begins in trying to re-establish trading relationships with our EU partners which would see as little friction or duty as possible. Well know in the coming months whether the new market opportunities we have been promised will materialise, how long the processes will take, and what the immediate impact of exiting the EU will be for business across the UK and Ireland.We can now welcome the fact that we now have a working government at Stormont. Our MLAs are now back in their seats, committees up-and-running, and ministers staring at burgeoning in-trays. There seems to be some form of contentment and agreement among our parties on a range of important issues, including mental health. We are, however, already seeing the odd ergence, including whether we should continue the move to devolve and reduce corporation tax here – Finance Minister Conor Murphy pushing it into the long grass, while Economy Minister Diane Dodds has suggested that it remains on the policy books as an option.It’s just one of the myriad of areas of the economy and business which need to be addressed in the coming weeks and months – including a close look at the draft rates revaluation, which has certainly got the dander up among some of our best-known hospitality businesses.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
