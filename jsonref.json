Pictured, with his wife Camilla at the Braemar Gathering last weekIn a statement about the tiff between Andrew and Johnstone-Burt, a spokesman said:  ‘Some time ago there was a disagreement between the Duke of York and a member of staff. The disagreement was resolved and there are no ongoing issues’.The disagreement was said to have happened at the beginning of this month, and sources had previously told the Mail on Sunday that Prince Andrew had been \u0027very cross\u0027 and it was even thought that Prince Charles had asked him to apologise.  There was said to have been words on both sides but no actual physical altercation between the two parties.‘It was a verbal dispute. It was a work-related issue. The Duke got very cross that what he wanted wasn’t possible.’         Mr Johnstone-Burt (pictured above) looks after teams including catering, housekeeping and entertainmentPrince Charles subsequently heard of the row and asked his brother to say sorry.The source added: ‘The Duke explained the situation to the Prince of Wales and left it at that. There was no apology because there was nothing to apologise for. The Duke maintains a good relationship with the Prince of Wales.’ Johnstone-Burt, who has worked at the palace for six years, is responsible for 250 staff covering catering, housekeeping, entertainment, maintenance and administration.On September 7, a source close to Charles said such an intervention would not be unusual. ‘He is the second most senior member of the family and is known to take action when and where is necessary.‘Mostly he is well informed and will intervene where it is appropriate to do so.’He is also in charge of a £370 million, ten-year re-fit of the Queen’s official London residence.Johnstone-Burt joined the Royal Navy in 1977 and served in the Falklands before eventually being promoted to vice-admiral and becoming the Chief of Staff to Nato’s Supreme Allied Command Transformation at Norfolk, Virginia.He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath by the Queen in 2013.        "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/07/18/09/0693FF60000003E8-7260117-Victims_top_row_left_to_right_Elaine_McIver_43_Saffie_Roussos_8_-m-57_1563438293124.jpg","title":"Car makers leave handbrakes future switch electronic devices","story":"Share this article Some motorists may be dubious about the safety or reliability of the new technology after a spate of recalls by brands for potentially faulty electronic brake systems.Volkswagen issued a recall for 134,000 UK cars in 2017 over problems with its parking brake, affecting Golf, Touran, Tiguan and Passat models.The same year, Tesla issued a global recall of 53,000 cars and Audi, Renault and Toyota have all also had to recall models over electronic brake faults in the past.The risk of hacking attacks also rises as ever more electronics are introduced into vehicles.Researchers have previously demonstrated their ability to hack the computers in cars, remotely controlling steering, acceleration and braking.The AA says it is \u0027broadly in favour\u0027 of electronic systems as they hold cars more securely but warns that they could confuse drivers without \u0027consumer education\u0027.          Within a few years, mechanical handbrakes will be consigned to history alongside chokes, cassette players and wind-up windows (stock photo)Its head of road policy Jack Cousens said: \u0027Electronic parking devices are simple to use and reduce the scope for human error as they set the brake tension to the correct level.\u0027They put an end to cars rolling down inclines because the handbrake was not fully on and they make hill starts easier.\u0027We see it more as a consumer education issue for car buyers or hirers.\u0027It is simply a ten second lesson where the garage or car hire firm points out the device, so that drivers are not left scrabbling around, wondering where the handbrake is.\u0027He said that electronic systems remove the physical effort of yanking a chunky lever and free up space in the centre console.With the technology - first used on the BMW 7 Series in 2001 - becoming ever more affordable, the manual method is likely to be phased out entirely over the next few years.The CarGurus study found that only 30 per cent of new models now have handbrakes, down from 37 per cent in 2018.CarGurus UK editor Chris Knapman confirmed that the handbrake is heading for extinction..He said: \u0027It\u0027s official, the death of the handbrake is coming as manufacturers switch to electronic parking brakes in huge numbers.\u0027They have rapidly gone from being a novelty to what our research shows is now the norm.\u0027Within the next few years we expect the number of cars on sale with traditional handbrakes to decline further, likely only to be found on a select number of niche models.\u0027These systems might lack the tactile feel that some drivers value from a traditional manual parking brake but they bring several benefits in terms of convenience, safety and packaging.\u0027An electronic parking brake can engage automatically when a car\u0027s engine is switched off and many also include an auto-hold function that will apply the parking brake when a car is stopped in traffic or on a hill.\u0027Electronic parking brakes are also easier to install than their manual equivalents and replacing a handbrake lever with a simple button frees up more space in a car\u0027s interior – useful perhaps for an extra cup holder or two!\u0027But he added that the trend for electronic devices might take some of the fun out of driving for new motorists.He said: \u0027Of course, the benefits can\u0027t be ignored but as the latest technology trickles through manufacturer line-ups, many new drivers might never experience one of the most familiar of automotive features.\u0027The temptation to attempt flamboyant handbrake turns is soon to be a thing of the past too!\u0027Earlier this week, it emerged that some of the world\u0027s biggest makers of self-driving cars want US regulators to remove the requirement for steering wheels, pedals and mirrors.Companies including Honda, Uber, Waymo and Lyft, which are developing autonomous cars, want the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to recognise self-driving cars as a separate vehicle class to address the rules. "},{"url":null,"title":"Sir Geoffrey Boycotts ex girlfriend insists doesnt deserve knighthood","story":"Share this articleSir Geoff Boycott’s ex slams knighthood for star who beat her to a bloody mess in hotel attack – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"Britains eligible bachelor Duke Army friend Prince Harry 38 believed single","story":"Share this article Together the pair welcomed a baby girl, Charlie\u0027s first child, four years ago.

She worked as a guitar teacher and a toy shop sales assistant before being signed by Domino Records in 2009. Brian Eno was an early champion, calling Calvi “the biggest thing since Patti Smith” and singing and playing on her debut album. She’s also collaborated with David Byrne, Marianne Faithfull and PJ Harvey producer Rob Ellis. Calvi’s guitar-driven art-rock sound is often described as dark and cinematic, so it’s not too surprising that she’s recently scored series five of Peaky Blinders.Influences: Black Midi’s name comes from an internet music genre the band learned of via YouTube, a video frontman Geordie Greep has said they “haven’t spent more than five minutes watching”. The four-piece experimental rock band initially bonded over a shared love of Talking Heads, Deerhoof and Danny Brown, but that doesn’t mean these acts are “influences” in the traditional sense. According to Greep, “there’s stuff we all like, but it’s not like we all like stuff that we based the band on sort of thing. We’ve tried to keep the band quite distinct from what we like.”Scene: Black Midi formed at the Brit School, the Croydon performing arts institution known for cultivating Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. They then honed their live skills at Brixton venue the Windmill, a bastion of the south London indie scene. Though they’re hardly typical Brit School alumni, the group acknowledge they owe a debt to their time there. “You do shows every term and stuff,” Greep has said. “So once you get out you’ve got a really good idea of how sound works. It meant we left school, could play at the Windmill and knew how to soundcheck straight away.”Influences: Growing up in Wales in the 90s, Cate Le Bon’s father would make her mixtapes introducing her to seminal artists such as Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. She was also drawn to California rockers Pavement and two leading Welsh bands of the era, Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci. Her shortlisted album Reward grew from a year of “self-imposed isolation” in Cumbria where she spent her time woodworking by day and later, “playing the piano and singing into the night”.Scene: Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon’s roots lie in the Welsh indie scene. She first came to prominence opening for Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on his 2007 solo tour, then singing on I Lust U, a standout track from Rhys’s electro-pop side project Neon Neon. She’s since released five albums, collaborated with John Cale and the Manic Street Preachers, and co-produced an album by American indie rockers Deerhunter. She’s revered by peers including St. Vincent and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who earlier this year described Le Bon as “pretty much my favourite artist”, going on to say: “I’m mesmerised by her output over the last 10 years.”Scene: Dave is a leading light of the blossoming British hip-hop scene. Fellow London rappers Stormzy and Wiley supported him early on then Dave’s profile grew again when US superstar Drake jumped on a remix of his 2017 track Wanna Know. More recently, the 21-year-old has collaborated with several other London rappers including Headie One, J Hus and Fredo, who featured on Dave’s chart-topping single Funky Friday. This year, Dave has underlined his rising star status with a guest spot on Ed Sheeran’s No.6 Collaborations Project.Influences: Oxford band Foals have cited minimalist composer Steve Reich, indie icons Pixies and innovative dance producer Arthur Baker as influences. Frontman Yannis Philippakis has also said that a “general anxiety” caused by Trump, Brexit and climate change fed into their shortlisted album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1. “I was listening to the tracks in the pub and I’d I look up and see a pub garden full of people and realise: ‘We’re all in this shitstorm together.’ I felt the songs should deal with that,” he said recently.Scene: Foals formed in Oxford’s indie scene in 2005. Two band members, frontman Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan, were previously part of another band, math-rockers The Edmund Fitzgerald, who disbanded when things apparently became “too serious”. Since releasing their debut album Antidotes in 2008, Foals have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize on three occasions and become seasoned festival headliners. A follow-up to their shortlisted album, the logically-titled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, is due in October.Influences: Dublin post-punks Fontaines DC are influenced by the Strokes, the Libertines and the Velvet Underground they’ve called the latter “the base point of modern music”. Frontman Grian Chatten has also cited the Pogues’ 1984 debut album Red Roses for Me as a major touchstone for their own shortlisted debut, Dogrel, saying: “It sounds so raucous but at the same time so intelligent.” But the band’s most formative influence could be their hometown. “I think of Dublin and our music as one and the same, because it was written by people who were intensely absorbed by the city,” Chatten has said.Scene: Inspired by fellow Dubliners Girl Band, whom they credit with “modernising” Irish music, Fontaines DC are part of a new wave of Irish guitar bands making music with a strong social conscience. Discussing the scene earlier this year, Fontaines bassist Conor Deegan III said: “There’s so many things going on in Ireland, socially and politically, that for so long were not being talked about. It feels like there’s a coherent voice for our generation again.” Having toured with Shame and Idles, Fontaines DC also have close connections with the UK guitar music scene.Influences: While often described as a post-punk band, Idles frontman Joe Talbot has said they’re really “a product of different things we love”. The Bristol outfit’s shortlisted second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance, is influenced by the Sex Pistols, Interpol and Welsh post-hardcore group Mclusky, plus garage music, grime and jungle. It’s all funnelled into a righteous and rousing call-to-arms which takes on toxic masculinity, class conflict, immigration and Brexit. The end result isn’t anger, said Talbot, but music that’s “all about opening up and being vulnerable”.Influences: Little Simz said her shortlisted album Grey Area was inspired by “just coming into myself a lot more and being a young woman in my mid-20s and still learning about myself”. The north London artist, whose real name is Simbi Ajikawo, has said that listening to grime as a teenager influenced her writing style, but Grey Area also draws from other sources. Produced by her childhood friend Inflo, it incorporates jazz, funk, soul, rock and trip-hop, and includes collaborations with reggae artist Chronixx, folk-rock singer Michael Kiwanuka and electro-R\u0026ampB band Little Dragon.Scene: Little Simz said earlier this year that “people have struggled with finding where to place me”, adding: “And I think that’s also because I don’t even know where I fit.” This doesn’t mean the north London rapper lacks influential and high-profile fans. Two years ago, Kendrick Lamar said she “might be the illest doing it”, and she’s been tapped for collaborations by Gorillaz, Khalid and alt-j. Simz has even toured with Lauryn Hill, whose seminal album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was part of her “day-to-day life” when she was growing up.Influences: Neo Jessica Joshua, better known as Nao, grew up in Hackney listening to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop and UK garage, as well as Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Conceptually, her shortlisted second album is inspired by astrology’s Saturn return. “It’s this idea that Saturn takes 29 years to orbit from when you’re born and it is the planet of blessings and growth. So by the time you’re around 29, between 27 and 32, something big happens in your life,” 31-year-old Nao says. “You start to rethink everything – old stuff that your parents taught you or ideas that you believed in. It’s like a complete shedding of skin and it can be painful.”Scene: Nao’s unique musical journey means she doesn’t slot neatly into any particular scene. After studying vocal jazz at Guildhall School of Music \u0026amp Drama, she joined all-female beatboxing troupe The Boxettes, who were popular on YouTube. She also put in stints as a backing singer for Kwabs and Jarvis Cocker. When she released her debut album For All We Know in 2016, she often described her sound as “wonky funk”, and she’s since collaborated with Nile Rodgers \u0026amp Chic and Disclosure.Influences: Led by alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, SEED Ensemble is a 10-piece band “combining jazz with inner-city London, West African and Caribbean-influenced groove”. Kinoshi says she’s personally influenced by composers such as Maria Schneider, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, and named Driftglass after a collection of short stories by African-American author Samuel R Delany. “This record specifically focuses on interpreting … what driftglass is as an analogy for how improvised music changes and evolves over time depending on its environment,” she says. “Sci-fi, specifically space travel and Afrofuturist references to water and its connection to black history, were also important in its creation.”Influences: Northampton rapper Tyron Frampton, or Slowthai, has varied musical influences ranging from the Beatles to Basement Jaxx, and So Solid Crew to Elliot Smith. He namechecks the Prodigy on Nothing Great About Britain, the title track from his shortlisted debut album, saying: “I am a prodigy – they made me.” He’s also said he related to Radiohead’s Creep during his formative years. His album is an impassioned mix of hip-hop, grime, electronica and punk, so it’s fitting that it features collaborations with both grime icon Skepta and noisenik guitar duo Slaves.Scene: Tyron Frampton, the rapper better known as Slowthai, was born and raised in Northampton. “It’s always been a band town,” he said earlier this year. “There’s always been good music but never a strong scene to keep it going.” His own music mixes hip-hop grit with a scabrous punk energy, but he’s keen not to be pigeonholed, saying: “I want to play guitar, piano, drums, write songs for other people. I can do punk, I can do indie, but as long as it has my voice, it’ll always be my sound.”Scene: The four members of the 1975 met at Wilmslow High School and started making music at 15. At one point, they operated as a punk covers band, but they soon developed their own genre-splicing songwriting style inspired by everyone from Michael Jackson to My Bloody Valentine. Since signing to indie label Dirty Hit and breaking through with 2013’s self-titled debut, band members Matt Healy and George Daniel have co-written tracks for fellow Dirty Hit artists Pale Waves, The Japanese House and No Rome.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

All over the world, life-size sculpted representations of his tall figure appear. A hundred Gormleys look out permanently from Crosby beach in Liverpool, he has situated versions of himself in the Austrian Alps and in São Paulo in Brazil, and stood sentinel on high buildings in New York and London. He is particularly celebrated for his 20-metre The Angel of the North, near Gateshead. He is married to the artist Vicken Parsons, with whom he has three grownup children, and is currently preparing for a retrospective of his work at the Royal Academy of Arts.You grew up in a Catholic family, your father was a pharmaceutical magnate and you were the youngest of seven children. Did being the youngest affect your way of looking at things?Fundamentally – I arrived last in a family that ned the second world war. All important decisions about how life was to be conducted had already been made. I had to find my own way. I felt I’d been born into the wrong family – “these people, they don’t need me”. There was a degree of unhappiness and resentment yet I was lucky. I was the last and able to break all the rules.Did you know at Cambridge University that sculpture would be your career?I was a painter, film-maker, drawer at university. After I left, I paid for three years of travelling doing murals: Cambridge May balls, discos, the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth. I went around Britain on a motorbike with paints in a big box. I charged five shillings a square foot and made a thousand pounds. The shift to sculpture was because I realised sculpture was not about copying something else, it was a thing in itself. Sculpture does not need a roof, label, institution to protect it. It can simply be in the world and the world changes. That, for me, is an act of hope.And “simply” is the point? There’s a distinct lack of ornamentation in your work… The work is about bare life. It is about returning people to bare life, which means an acceptance of death, the truth of being other to ourselves as well as another to others, the truth of the uniqueness of human existence. These things cannot be illustrated. They need a point of recognition.How much have your artistic preoccupations changed during the course of your working life?I began by thinking: here is a body that needs to be explored from the inside. I started with my own existence because it is the closest thing to me – the body is the only bit of the material world one actually inhabits. Then I guess the shift has been to encourage the viewer to do the same. From making factual, three-dimensional shadows that said “Here is the place a body once was” or “What is a body?”, the work started to invite viewers not just in contemplative, meditative, internal observation but actually to see their own bodies as instruments with which to negotiate space and time.In these figures of yourself, are you Everyman or are you just you?I am both. The instrument is particular, the ambition universal.What would you say in response to the charge that it is arrogant to place these images of yourself around the world?If it was about self-aggrandisement, there would be better ways of doing this. I would say in defence of narcissism, if you don’t examine your own life, you’ve no right to examine anybody else’s. I go back to this: what is the typical view of the male sculptor? Take Rodin or Maillol – male artists who made idealised versions of female bodies. I was keen to start with reality and not speak about things apart from me but acknowledge the subjective condition of our experience. Statuary has historically been used to reinforce ideas of moral superiority, national identity, hero worship, idealised sexuality. My figures are here to disrupt your sense of the norm. I want to suggest that daily life and the things we ignore are worthy of attention.Speaking of attention – what does your interest in Buddhism contribute to your work?I’d like my sculpture to be an invitation to mindfulness. I don’t have a formal sitting regime myself but the work I do is based on the idea of complete concentration and being there. In a digital age, sculpture – its silence and stillness – is the antithesis and foil to constant calls to distraction. I cherish it for that. I think that’s its power.How useful has it been to be married to an artist?Only another artist would put up with living with an artist. I couldn’t have done what I have done without Vicken’s help. My lover, muse, assistant – she is the maker of my life, really. She has been the most incredible companion creatively and emotionally. She remains absolutely inspirational. Right through those early days when it wasn’t looking as if it was going to work out – my God, you know, we had three children and I had a two-day teaching job at Brighton but no gallery in Britain until 1993 – Vicken quietly accepted whatever came along and also supported me, did all the moulding, did the lion’s share of child-rearing and never stopped working herself.What makes you happiest?Two things: being at the foundry, seeing a work realised. Until it is made, it is almost in the air because it is polystyrene – the lightest-weight material – it is still just an idea and then, in less than a minute, the void becomes solid and there is something totally, euphorically magical about that moment of transformation. The other thing is being out in a boat in a good wind, playing the elements against each other.And drawing?Drawing is about being with the materials: feeling the skin of the paper absorbing the scratch of a pen. In drawing, you can go to places you could never otherwise reach mentally or physically. It is another place of absolute joy and happiness.● The Antony Gormley retrospective is at the Royal Academy of Arts, London W1, from 21 September to 3 December"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed1fbcca2e28402530399c85d16311d293fb418a/0_110_5271_3162/master/5271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41715614a0fb7aba5d2d1584a41b67a3","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"Hurricane Dorian, protests in Hong Kong, fashion weeks in London and New York and the burning Amazon – the last seven days, as captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23e59ec0e125f88fda2cf1245db989d4e0f541ff/0_165_4626_2776/master/4626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f9dc6b7e75180ef07d4dfe3df6c1fde","title":"share your reviews of the testaments by margaret atwood","story":"Whether you’ve been waiting decades for the sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale or you’re new to Atwood, we’d like to hear from youIt is the literary event of 2019 and 34 years in the making: The Testaments, Margaret Atwood’s sequel to her dystopian feminist classic The Handmaid’s Tale is finally out in the world (a week after Amazon’s embargo-busting snafu.)

My grandparents met when they both worked for Dickinson \u0026amp Morris bakery in Melton Mowbray. He was a burly man with fat fingers, a master baker who would tour country fairs demonstrating how to make a proper hand-raised pie. The sides of a pork pie should always be saggy: if they are straight and firm, it has been cooked in a tin.My grandmother was tiny, curly-haired, with a twinkly smile that I remember clearly from my youth. Grandad’s job was to build the crust of the pie around a lump of peppery, grey sausage meat: her task was to pour hot jelly in a circle around the meat. When the jelly set, it would form a rubbery layer, which I disliked as a child and would always peel away. My grandparents’ gazes met across a pie one day and the result was three children and nine grandchildren.My mother was their youngest. She grew up on the edge of a village close to Melton Mowbray called Nether Broughton. Many of my her side of the family still live there and we visited as recently as this summer for my aunt’s 90th birthday. My mother only left her parents’ house when she married my father and they settled in Melton Mowbray, where I was born.When I was two, our family moved 10 miles away to Oakham, the county town of Rutland. This was considered a move up, Oakham being smaller and posher than Melton. My parents were able to buy a plot of land on a new housing estate on the edge of town that was thought to be rather grand, and have a three-bedroom bungalow built to house their growing family. We all went to the local primary school, played on the waste ground at the back of our shiny new estate with its big houses and gardens. It was on that ground that I built my own den in a hollow and sat for hours, shivering in an anorak, reading the Narnia books by CS Lewis. Melton still felt like our roots, though, and pork pies an important part of our family mythology as well our diet: Saturday teatimes usually included one.Rutland was amalgamated with Leicestershire in 1974, which meant that Melton Mowbray and Oakham were, for a few years, in the same county. The planners reckoned without local nationalism though. For most of my childhood, when we returned from our annual caravan holiday, we would drive past the “Leicestershire” sign and a few yards on, drive past one that said “Rutland”. Every time the council took the Rutland sign down, it was re-erected by activists. After a sustained campaign, Rutland became a county again in 1997 and “Multum in parvo”, much-in-little, remains its local motto. I remember being comforted by this as a child. I was little, but I was going to do great things. When I wasn’t hiding in my book den, I was in the local library, which had the great virtue of being warm.I don’t eat pork pies that often now but when I do, I have my very own Proustian moment, back to discarding the jelly on a Saturday teatime, the battered paperbacks I hid in my anorak pocket – and the image of my grandparents meeting at the Dickinson \u0026amp Morris bakery.• Platform Seven by Louise Doughty is published by Faber (£14.99).

A really strong theme running through the book is the links between it and the crisis of rising white supremacy, the various forms of nationalism and the fact that so many people are being forced from their homelands, and the war that is waged on our attention s. These are intersecting and interconnecting crises and so the solutions have to be as well.Do you feel encouraged by talk of the Green New Deal?I feel a tremendous excitement and a sense of relief, that we are finally talking about solutions on the scale of the crisis we face. That we’re not talking about a little carbon tax or a cap and trade scheme as a silver bullet. We’re talking about transforming our economy. This system is failing the majority of people anyway, which is why we’re in this period of such profound political destabilisation – that is giving us the Trumps and the Brexits, and all of these strongman leaders – so why don’t we figure out how to change everything from bottom to top, and do it in a way that addresses all of these other crises at the same time? There is every chance we will miss the mark, but every fraction of a degree warming that we are able to hold off is a victory and every policy that we are able to win that makes our societies more humane, the more we will weather the inevitable shocks and storms to come without slipping into barbarism. Because what really terrifies me is what we are seeing at our borders in Europe and North America and Australia – I don’t think it’s coincidental that the settler colonial states and the countries that are the engines of that colonialism are at the forefront of this. We are seeing the beginnings of the era of climate barbarism. We saw it in Christchurch, we saw it in El Paso, where you have this marrying of white supremacist violence with vicious anti-immigrant racism.That is one of the most chilling sections of your book: I think that’s a link a lot of people haven’t made.This pattern has been clear for a while. White supremacy emerged not just because people felt like thinking up ideas that were going to get a lot of people killed but because it was useful to protect barbaric but highly profitable actions. The age of scientific racism begins alongside the transatlantic slave trade, it is a rationale for that brutality. If we are going to respond to climate change by fortressing our borders, then of course the theories that would justify that, that create these hierarchies of humanity, will come surging back. There have been signs of that for years, but it is getting harder to deny because you have killers who are screaming it from the rooftops.One criticism you hear about the environment movement is that it is dominated by white people. How do you address that?When you have a movement that is overwhelmingly representative of the most privileged sector of society then the approach is going to be much more fearful of change, because people who have a lot to lose tend to be more fearful of change, whereas people who have a lot to gain will tend to fight harder for it. That’s the big benefit of having an approach to climate change that links it to those so called bread and butter issues: how are we going to get better paid jobs, affordable housing, a way for people to take care of their families? I have had many conversations with environmentalists over the years where they seem really to believe that by linking fighting climate change with fighting poverty, or fighting for racial justice, it’s going to make the fight harder. We have to get out of this “my crisis is bigger than your crisis: first we save the planet and then we fight poverty and racism, and violence against women”. That doesn’t work. That alienates the people who would fight hardest for change. This debate has shifted a huge amount in the US because of the leadership of the climate justice movement and because it is congresswomen of colour who are championing the Green New Deal. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib come from communities that have gotten such a raw deal under the years of neoliberalism and longer, and are determined to represent, truly represent, the interests of those communities. They’re not afraid of deep change because their communities desperately need it.In the book, you write: “The hard truth is that the answer to the question ‘What can I, as an inidual, do to stop climate change?’ is: nothing.” Do you still believe that?In terms of the carbon, the inidual decisions that we make are not going to add up to anything like the kind of scale of change that we need. And I do believe that the fact that for so many people it’s so much more comfortable to talk about our own personal consumption, than to talk about systemic change, is a product of neoliberalism, that we have been trained to see ourselves as consumers first. To me that’s the benefit of bringing up these historical analogies, like the New Deal or the Marshall Plan – it brings our minds back to a time when we were able to think of change on that scale. Because we’ve been trained to think very small. It is incredibly significant that Greta Thunberg has turned her life into a living emergency.Yes, she set sail for the UN climate summit in New York on a zero carbon yacht ...Exactly. But this isn’t about what Greta is doing as an inidual. It’s about what Greta is broadcasting in the choices that she makes as an activist, and I absolutely respect that. I think it’s magnificent. She is using the power that she has to broadcast that this is an emergency, and trying to inspire politicians to treat it as an emergency. I don’t think anybody is exempt from scrutinising their own decisions and behaviours but I think it is possible to overemphasise the inidual choices. I have made a choice – and this has been true since I wrote No Logo, and I started getting these “what should I buy, where should I shop, what are the ethical clothes?” questions. My answer continues to be that I am not a lifestyle adviser, I am not anyone’s shopping guru, and I make these decisions in my own life but I’m under no illusion that these decisions are going to make the difference.Some people are choosing to go on birth strikes. What do you think about that?I’m happy these discussions are coming into the public domain as opposed to being furtive issues we’re afraid to talk about. It’s been very isolating for people. It certainly was for me. One of the reasons I waited as long as I did to try and get pregnant, and I would say this to my partner all the time – what, you want to have a Mad Max water warrior fighting with their friends for food and water? It wasn’t until I was part of the climate justice movement and I could see a path forward that I could even imagine having a kid. But I would never tell anybody how to answer this most intimate of questions. As a feminist who knows the brutal history of forced sterilisation and the ways in which women’s bodies become battle zones when policymakers decide that they are going to try and control population, I think that the idea that there are regulatory solutions when it comes to whether or not to have kids is catastrophically ahistorical. We need to be struggling with our climate grief together and our climate fears together, through whatever decision we decide to make, but the discussion we need to have is how do we build a world so that those kids can have thriving, zero-carbon lives?Over the summer, you encouraged people to read Richard Powers’s novel, The Overstory. Why?It’s been incredibly important to me and I’m happy that so many people have written to me since. What Powers is writing about trees: that trees live in communities and are in communication, and plan and react together, and we’ve been completely wrong in the way we conceptualise them. It’s the same conversation we’re having about whether we are going to solve this as iniduals or whether we are going to save the collective organism. It’s also rare, in good fiction, to valorise activism, to treat it with real respect, failures and all, to acknowledge the heroism of the people who put their bodies on the line. I thought Powers did that in a really extraordinary way.What are you views on what Extinction Rebellion has achieved?One thing they have done so well is break us out of this classic campaign model we have been in for a long time, where you tell someone something scary, you ask them to click on something to do something about it, you skip out the whole phase where we need to grieve together and feel together and process what it is that we just saw. Because what I hear a lot from people is, ok, maybe those people back in the 1930s or 40s could organise neighbourhood by neighbourhood or workplace by workplace but we can’t. We believe we’ve been so downgraded as a species that we are incapable of that. The only thing that is going to change that belief is getting face to face, in community, having experiences, off our screens, with one another on the streets and in nature, and winning some things and feeling that power.You talk about stamina in the book. How do you keep going? Do you feel hopeful?I have complicated feelings about the hope question. Not a day goes by that I don’t have a moment of sheer panic, raw terror, complete conviction that we are doomed, and then I do pull myself out of it. I’m renewed by this new generation that is so determined, so forceful. I’m inspired by the willingness to engage in electoral politics, because my generation, when we were in our 20s and 30s, there was so much suspicion around getting our hands dirty with electoral politics that we lost a lot of opportunities. What gives me the most hope right now is that we’ve finally got the vision for what we want instead, or at least the first rough draft of it. This is the first time this has happened in my lifetime. And also, I did decide to have kids. I have a seven year old who is so completely obsessed and in love with the natural world. When I think about him, after we’ve spent an entire summer talking about the role of salmon in feeding the forests where he was born in British Columbia, and how they are linked to the health of the trees and the soil and the bears and the orcas and this entire magnificent ecosystem, and I think about what it would be like to have to tell him that there are no more salmon, it kills me. So that motivates me. And slays me.• Naomi Klein will be in conversation with Katharine Viner at a  Live event on 15 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43a7d0fa640b3756d915d2c68c58e8298a2f417/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a19436fb58a872b1d91041ea32325f0","title":"no deal brexit food shortages are you a small business owner whos stockpiling","story":"We’d like to hear from people in the food industry about stockpiling ahead of potential food shortages and price rises in the event of a no-deal BrexitA no-deal Brexit could result in rising food prices and shortages of certain types of fresh food, according to secret documents the government was forced by MPs to publish on Wednesday.Ministers have refused to disclose details about their discussions with local authorities and the food industry over possible disruptions to food supplies, arguing that the information could damage negotiations with the EU.But the chief executive of the Co-op warned on Thursday that the convenience chain were likely to be low on fruits including apples and pears, which are imported during the winter, in the event of a no-deal scenario.We would like to speak to small business owners in the food industry – from greengrocers to restaurateurs – about what products they have begun stockpiling in case of extensive delays at the UK border.Are you a small business owner who is stockpiling ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit?

The British ships were no longer carrying fine muslins and calico to Europe. The primary produce brought over was jute, cotton, the sorts of materials used in the emerging British industrial project.”Priyamvada Gopal, who teaches at the faculty of English at Cambridge University, said that Britain’s history of commercial shipping was “a deeply violent one, which included shipping millions of black and indentured bodies tightly packed in the holds of ships to be exploited on plantations.”“It is shameful to not acknowledge this in favour of a diffuse and dishonest pride,” Gopal said.“It is a reflection of the pervasive ignorance that goes hand in hand with Empire nostalgia” Wagner said.A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The slave trade was an abhorrent practice for which the British government has rightly apologised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fed0198a7e629031eeca8dddacf797e111c0a981/0_91_5644_3386/master/5644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c2f6538f4209a09d3374aa9dc3288a5","title":"meet the man behind sports directs upmarket rebrand","story":"Mike Ashley’s future son-in-law and head of elevation, Michael Murray, is busy reimagining the retail empireMen in sharp suits mix with models as Vogue editor Edward Enniful and fashion influencers sip champagne and Salty Dog cocktails while they peruse £525-a-pair bejewelled Jimmy Choo trainers at a glossy store on London’s Oxford Street.This is Flannels, the achingly expensive designer emporium which Mike Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, views as the future of his retail empire.Ashley himself is round the corner in the pub, sipping a pint. But working the floor is Michael Murray, Ashley’s future son-in-law, who the billionaire has made clear is in charge of turning his retail empire from pile-it-high joggers and hoodies to high-end brands and glitzy stores.Murray, Sports Direct’s “head of elevation” who celebrated his 30th birthday on Friday, says he has hardly slept for two weeks after opening a flagship project in Leicester – which turned a former BHS shop into a Flannels, a USC store and a Sports Direct – and the London designer store.“It has been pretty hectic and doesn’t look like slowing down any time soon,” Murray says.The Doncaster-born son of a property developer began by helping Ashley with personal property deals a few years after meeting his daughter Anna on holiday in 2011.He is now Ashley’s righthand man overseeing the revamp of Sports Direct stores as well as expanding Flannels, improving the group’s use of technology and building relationships with high-end brands.Ashley is clearly impressed, though after 37 years running Sports Direct it is clear he is not at home in the world of £800 Gucci trainers and £1,250 Moncler coats.At Sports Direct’s annual meeting in London on Wednesday, Ashley told shareholders not to buy anything in the Flannels store downstairs from the meeting room. “It’s eye-watering what some of the prices are for a pair of shoes or a cap,” he said.But he does understand the numbers. He describes the elevation strategy as “a golden ticket” and says he would like to have 100 stores like the new Leicester outlet. “I would like to click my fingers and have 100 Leicesters tomorrow … God do they take some money,” he said.Murray says his payout is “a very fair deal for Sports Direct”. He adds: “It is up to the non-executives what I get paid. I don’t take a salary and there are no guarantees. I get paid based on property performance and everything else is technically thrown in.“I oversee the future direction of the business and how stores look and what brands we should and shouldn’t be stocking.”The old guard may have concerns at Murray’s heavy involvement in operations directed from the £108m Oxford Street building, which now includes a new London head office for the group and a new team and culture that is very different from that at the group’s warehouse and main office in Shirebrook, Derbyshire.The group is moving further away from its roots with risky acquisitions including House of Fraser, which is losing more than £1m a week, and Jack Wills, the loss-making preppy brand. In July, the group admitted it could not put a figure on its future profitability as a result of the disastrous £90m buyout of the House of Fraser chain. It recently shocked investors with the revelation of a €674m (£600m) tax bill from the Belgian authorities.While those that know him say Murray is bright and likeable, he is viewed as inexperienced by the old guard and part of a new, less cost-conscious culture at the business where once executives stayed in the Premier Inn and took budget airline flights. Long-standing former lieutenants who helped build Sports Direct, including finance director Jon Kempster and Byers, have now departed.There are also rumblings over Murray’s influence over Ashley, who has clearly been very impressed with the strong performance of Flannels and improved Sports Direct stores which the younger man has overseen. “He clearly has Mike’s ear,” said one source who knows the company well, suggesting the pair thrash out business deals over drinks or dinner or on family holidays away from the wider management team. “He’s paying fortunes to someone unproven,” says another source close to the company.Murray says his role is clearly defined.“I’m thinking about the next 10 to 20 years. Me and Mike are working like a partnership. He looks after the back end – systems, logistics – I look after customer-facing side and the image of the business.”That image does have its problems, he admits. Sports Direct has what he refers to as “hindrances” from its historic reputation, a reference to when  reporters went undercover at the Sports Direct warehouse and discovered workers being underpaid and working in poor conditions: “It does definitely come with issues but you can’t have it all. In a couple of years time that will all be in the past.”Asked if he’d like to run the whole show one day, Murray say it’s not his decision. But he says: “The business is rapidly transforming. We only started elevating two or three years ago. With the amount that has been achieved or is being achieved it is not necessary to break a winning formula.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b757a07c5edca22eb543cb614d7dfddaffe8d94/0_252_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c471f94e66eb45a17bc64c976069d2e7","title":"last night proms woke classical music","story":"My composition premieres tonight. It’s a recognition that classical music needs more ersity, to make it meaningful for all of usIn recent years we seem to have reached peak wokeness, but not entirely for the right reasons. I first heard woke as an adjective from the US, alongside the rise of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. The term “stay woke” was used as an empowering slogan that encouraged people to be vigilant to the injustices in society, especially racism. But as the word grew in popularity, the licence to use it in any which way expanded and its meaning became diluted. It was in response to this woke-washing that I decided to call my piece for tonight’s Last Night of the Proms “Woke”.As a composer whose father is Eritrean, whose mother is Russian and who was born and raised in the UK, I have always embraced a mixed and erse outlook. With age I have begun to truly appreciate the richness of drawing inspiration from a variety of perspectives. Having three cultures at hand to quarry for ideas – a triptych of folklore, language and traditions – is much more fruitful than just one.My journey into music began with group recorder lessons at a state primary school. I then progressed to the violin – my dad had a dream of me playing the instrument. At my local Centre for Young Musicians I had my first proper encounter with contemporary classical music. After being spotted singing in a choir I was recruited to join the English National Opera children’s chorus, where I sang in La Bohème, Carmen, a Bolshoi Opera production of Boris Godunov and the premiere of Mark-Anthony Turnage’s The Silver Tassie. And so began my love for new music, so much so that when I obtained a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Music, I took up composition. I am always very thankful to those who encouraged and supported me along the way. I also remember feeling a sense of otherness – where were all the other black and minority-ethnic children? The realisation that classical music is an industry with a one-sided vista was something that didn’t sit well with me from an early age. I have heard many an argument as to why this might be the case – a popular notion is that western classical music is a European tradition, and therefore makes the current state of affairs acceptable. It doesn’t. Successful composers such as Chevalier de Saint-Georges and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor existed, yet their music remains in the shadows. Why? Those in the industry should promote ersity. By doing so they will make classical music meaningful for all and sow interest among future generations. When I was growing up, there were no words like woke. Instead, I remember vividly the tragic slaying of Stephen Lawrence and the phrase that was coined by the inquiry into his murder – institutional racism.And so for the Last Night of the Proms, my wish is for my piece to be taken as a musical call for greater empathy and a willingness to try something new – whether musically or culturally. We can all play a part in staying vigilant and woke.• Daniel Kidane is a classical composer. His composition Woke is to have its premiere at the Last Night of the Proms, Saturday 14 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e45d42b143abff52e01d9db9f39caa87b6e58cf7/0_579_2238_1343/master/2238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8e978ef10786b7f117ed9557f495142","title":"o for a draught of vintage keats house scraps plan to sell alcohol","story":"Hampstead museum where poet once lived drops plans following objections from locals“Give me books, French wine, fruit, fine weather and a little music played out of doors by somebody I do not know,” the Romantic poet John Keats wrote in a letter to his sister, Fanny, 200 years ago in August 1819.His 21st century neighbours would rather put the kettle on and hear absolutely nothing of their neighbours it seems. Dozens of Hampstead residents, including the TV presenter Bill Oddie, 78, were celebrating victory as the Keats House museum scrapped its “inappropriate” plans to sell alcohol and screen films.The Grade-I listed Georgian house in north-west London, Keats’ home for two years until shortly before his death in 1821 at the age of 25, inspired some of his most memorable poems and is now a popular museum. It attracted nearly 14,000 visitors over the last year.Keats House bosses were pilloried by local residents for setting out plans to sell alcohol until 10pm every day except Sunday and hold screenings and readings.Hampstead inspired various other romantic poets in Keats’ era, among them Byron, Wordsworth and Joanna Baillie.It’s questionable whether Keats, responsible for a poem containing the line “Give me women, wine, and snuff”, would approve of his neighbours’ objections.Campaigners referred to the poet’s more critical takes on inebriation, such as: “Shall I gulp wine? No, that is vulgarism, a heresy and schism, foisted into the canon-law of love.”In a letter to Camden council’s licensing panel, Oddie said: “It seems that sooner or later every attractive venue applies for a liquor and music licence, no matter how inappropriate it is.“As a resident of this area for over 30 years, I ask you to reconsider this proposal and support the notion of Keats House as a stylish historic memorial to the poet himself. Mind you, if he were in charge he and his mates would have probably have turned it into an opium den.”The City of London Corporation, which owns Keats House, amended its proposals, limiting events to 50 a year and capping indoor capacity to 100 people. Plans to sell beer were also scrapped. Alcohol will be sold at a maximum of six outdoor events a year, with a maximum capacity of 200.Instead of boozing at the museum, fans can do a ramble across Hampstead Heath and flock to the 16th century Spaniards Inn instead, said to be the pub where Keats wrote his famous Ode to a Nightingale.

A resourceful girl gang of exotic dancers sets out to “fleece” New York’s sleaziest fat cats, drugging their drinks and running up their credit card bills in an act of feminist liberation from both men and The Man. The year is 2007 and top-tier scumbags are coming “straight from the crime scene to the club”, as Jennifer Lopez’s den mother, Ramona, puts it, suggesting that her own lawless behaviour is simply fair game. Based on, and faithful to, a 2015 New York Magazine article by Jessica Pressler, Hustlers is a classically made film about capital – sexual, social and financial. What feels contemporary is the way it weaves in the impact of the 2008 financial crisis Wall Street on its ass, seen from an upskirt vantage point. For all its razzle-dazzle, its pessimistic subtext reminded me of another downbeat, post-recession take on the entertainment industry, Steven Soderbergh’s Magic Mike.Crazy Rich Asians’ Constance Wu plays foil to Lopez’s Ramona as the enjoyably unreliable ingenue Destiny, with Lopez harnessing her natural warmth, swagger and athleticism both on the pole and off. Writer-director Lorene Scafaria (2012’s Seeking a Friend for the End of the World) takes a playful approach to her source material, dressing Lopez in an enormous fur coat and lingerie in a nod to the music video for her 2002 hit Jenny from the Block. Elsewhere, rapper and ex-dancer Cardi B teaches Destiny how to give a lapdance, while a jaw-dropping striptease is soundtracked by Fiona Apple’s Criminal.Perhaps too reliant on the structure of the original article, which tells the events in flashback, the film wraps up a little hastily. Brilliantly, though, the editing is teasing rather than explicit Scafaria offers just enough of the girls and their bodies to get pulses racing without exploiting them or their story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35744333972741221e81229036062f61232c7f03/0_321_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a460a0a3ffed7c656b211034a33ad498","title":"toronto film festival rolls out red carpet","story":"While Hollywood heavyweights like Tom Hanks and Renée Zellweger were out in force, some of the biggest treats were smaller titlesEvery film festival has its own personality, its own unique selling point. And, for Toronto, one of the main selling points is its audience. Eagerly egalitarian in outlook, TIFF (to give the festival its jaunty nickname) is all about the punters. Not for nothing are we reminded at every screening that the most important prize at the festival is the People’s Choice, voted for by the audience.Toronto screenings are famously warm and fuzzy. Unlike the fractious industry crowd at Cannes and Venice, the Toronto audience would sooner drop kittens from the top of the CN Tower than boo at a movie premiere. All of which makes for a uniquely upbeat experience for film-makers who choose to premiere films there. But it can make it harder to gauge the real potential of a film, to sort the buzz from the noise. The concept of a crowd-pleaser is slightly devalued when the crowd is pleased by pretty much everything.This is further complicated by the sheer scale of the event. Although positioned at a slight disadvantage in the autumn festival season – just after the super-exclusive boutique showcase of Telluride and overlapping with awards launchpad Venice – Toronto dwarfs both with the size of its programme. And with so many starry, high-profile titles sucking the oxygen from the discourse, the worry is that some smaller titles get lost in the mix.That’s unlikely to be the case for the superb Irish crime drama, Calm With Horses. The feature debut from Nick Rowland, adapted from a short story about a boxer turned enforcer by Colin Barrett, was widely praised. In this film, the thoughts flow a little more slowly around the head of Douglas “Arm” Armstrong (a star-making turn from Cosmo Jarvis, last seen in Lady Macbeth) the feelings take a little longer to process. But that’s not to say they aren’t as deeply felt as those of anyone else. The assumption is that a man who is used as a blunt weapon by a criminal family is somehow immune to the emotional consequences of the damage he inflicts. But each of the punches he lands at the behest of the Devers clan leaves a bruise on his soul. He wrestles with the conflict between the violence of his life and his duty to his ex-girlfriend and their autistic son. The order to kill, delivered with red-rimmed ruthlessness by the hardest of the Devers hard men, is a step over the brink for Douglas in this outstanding study of a flawed man trying to be better.Another first feature that made an impact on critics and audiences alike is Sound of Metal, by Darius Marder, who co-wrote it with his brother, Abraham. The picture stars a bullet-eyed Riz Ahmed as a heavy metal drummer who suddenly loses his hearing. The story was loosely inspired by the experience of the brothers’ grandmother, who unexpectedly lost her hearing after taking antibiotics. Sound design is key in this film, which presents an alternative view on disability Ahmed’s character, a recovering addict, is struggling with his demons as well as his deafness. He finds an addiction support group that is part of a wider deaf community united by the philosophy that deafness is not a disability or something to be fixed.Elsewhere in the festival, another pair of film-making brothers, Josh and Benny Safdie, followed up their grungy Robert Pattinson-starring thriller Good Time with another nerve-shredding assault of a movie. Audacious, thrilling and exhausting, Uncut Gems stars Adam Sandler as a brash, wheeler-dealing jeweller with a disastrous gambling habit and a knack of turning even his rare flashes of good luck into bad.It’s a remarkable performance from Sandler, all sweat and bluster, with a desperate veneered grin. Much of the awards speculation at TIFF has built on the Venice momentum of Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker. But if I was inclined to bet, which, after two jangling hours of watching Sandler bleeding cash, I am not, I might take a punt on Sandler for best actor.The awards conversation must also include Renée Zellweger, who received what was reportedly the festival’s longest standing ovation after the screening of Judy, in which she plays a fragile, late-career Judy Garland. As one of the few festivals seriously attempting to redress the gender imbalance in its programme, Toronto boasted a strong selection of female-directed pictures. A stand-out was Sarah Gavron’s Rocks, about teenage female friendship in east London, a film that crackles with energy and honesty. Workshopped with a multicultural cast of non-professional actors, it’s a picture that felt truly vital, like real adolescent life in all its noise and chaos playing out in front of the camera.Teen girls were also well served by Coky Giedroyc’s How to Build a Girl, with Beanie Feldstein as an awkward Wolverhampton schoolgirl who reinvents herself as the wicked witch of rock criticism, the scourge of mediocre bloke rockers. The joyously boisterous screenplay, adapted by Caitlin Moran from her own book, is the star here.Another highlight was Marielle Heller’s follow up to Can You Ever Forgive Me?. Tom Hanks is perfectly cast in A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood as much-loved US children’s TV personality Mr Rogers. One might assume the film’s impact to be limited to people who grew up watching the show, but it is a quietly profound piece of cinematic group therapy, characterised by unexpectedly eccentric and inventive choices. I adored it.There were disappointments. Jojo Rabbit by Taika Waititi, about a Nazi boy who has Hitler (played by Waititi) as his imaginary friend is tonally uneven and not nearly as funny as a provocative “anti-hate satire” needs to be. And the long-awaited adaptation of Donna Tartt’s The Goldfinch felt like the longest two-and-a-half-hour movie ever made.But there was plenty of fun for audiences who looked in the right places. Rian Johnson’s first film since Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a blast. Knives Out is an Agatha Christie-inspired country house murder mystery starring Daniel Craig chewing his way through scenery and a southern accent as thick as gumbo, with Chris Evans, cast entertainingly against type. It’s pure pleasure. And Armando Iannucci’s The Personal History of David Copperfield, starring Dev Patel, is equally enjoyable.For me, the most unexpected treat was Justin Kurzel’s emphatic return to form with True History of the Kelly Gang, a swaggering, sexy, dissolute take on the story of Australia’s most famous outlaws. George MacKay plays Ned Kelly as a punk dandy psychopath Nicholas Hoult, as Kelly’s law enforcing nemesis, is the biggest thief of all, stealing every scene in which he appears. It’s a demented meltdown of a movie and I loved every frantic frame of it.Best filmsUncut Gems, directed by Josh and Benny Safdie Calm With Horses, directed by Nick Rowland True History of the Kelly Gang, directed by Justin Kurzel.Best performancesAdam Sandler in Uncut Gems Lesley Manville in Ordinary Love Riz Ahmed in Sound of Metal Deragh Campbell in Anne at 13,000ft.Best ensemble castThe actors in Rocks, with special mentions to Bukky Bakray, Kosar Ali, D’angelou Osei Kissiedu and Shaneigha-Monik Greyson.Best cinematographyDarius Khondji’s work on Uncut Gems, which borrows the colour palette of the gem of the title, a rare opal.Best costumesTrue History of the Kelly Gang.Best lack of costumeNicholas Hoult’s monologue in just sock suspenders in True History of the Kelly Gang.Most random tattooRiz Ahmed’s character in Sound of Metal has a pair of underpants tattooed on his right shoulder.

Today’s recipe is particularly aromatic: a cheat’s croissant made with pre-rolled puff-pastry filled with a push-of-a-button pistachio marzipan and sweet cherries. So few ingredients and little work for such lovely smells and so much joy … you may as well fling open the windows (and pass a plate around).You can use frozen cherries, if you like – just defrost them fully first.

Take one triangle and put the shortest side parallel to the worktop – this should be a long, skinny triangle with a sharp, slightly off-centre point at the top, so stretch the base a bit to even it out.Put a scant teaspoon each of the pistachio paste and drained cherries on the bottom of the triangle, 2cm from the edge – don’t be tempted to use more, or it’ll be too fat to roll. Roll the bottom edge over the filling and keep rolling, with the filling central – you’ll end up with a chubby bit in the middle and two horns.

This was one of them for Steve Bruce. His Newcastle team were belligerent, committed and disciplined at Anfield, they even took the lead, and they were still cut apart by the brilliant precision of Liverpool’s supreme attack. All Bruce could do was smile as the Kop celebrated with their old song about his big fat head.Sadio Mané struck twice and Mohamed Salah once as Liverpool recorded a 14th consecutive Premier League win and extended their unbeaten run to 22 league games, their longest sequence under the management of Jürgen Klopp. Both strikers were indebted to sublime assists from Roberto Firmino, who started the day on the bench as the Liverpool manager utilised his resources to telling effect. Jetro Willems’s thumping early strike for Newcastle and the hosts’ initial difficulties were long forgotten by the time Salah sealed victory for the Premier League leaders late in the second half.Klopp had been concerned the international break would disrupt a rhythm that had flowed so effectively in Liverpool’s last two outings against Burnley and Arsenal. His fears were founded initially. Liverpool were sluggish in the opening 20 minutes, their touches sloppy. The accuracy of Firmino and Jordan Henderson, both rested ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League tie at Napoli, was missed. An added problem was Newcastle’s disciplined organisation and sharpness on the counter attack.There was no surprise about the 5-4-1 formation that brought three points for Bruce’s team on their last away trip at Tottenham. In Christian Atsu and Joelinton, however, Newcastle had a potent mix of penetration and power that caused the Liverpool defence problems whenever it combined. The regret for Bruce was that it could not be sustained due to the intensity that eventually returned to the hosts’ display. The solace was the discomfort his team caused the European champions in those early stages and the outstanding breakthrough provided by Willems.Newcastle stunned Anfield when Atsu collected a long ball into the Liverpool half, drove forward and released Willems down the left. The wing-back stepped inside Trent Alexander-Arnold, a little too easily, and drove an unstoppable finish into Adrian’s top corner with his supposedly weaker right foot. Bruce burst out of his dug-out in shock and joy. His team had something to hold, Liverpool something to lose. Despite near misses from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mané the home team did not spark into life immediately after falling behind. But the pressure built gradually and inevitably told.Liverpool should have had a chance to level from the penalty spot when Jamaal Lascelles pulled Joel Matip down at a corner. Referee Andre Marriner was unconvinced and VAR did not intervene on a decision that looked clear to the naked eye. Klopp was still haranguing the fourth official when Liverpool did equalise courtesy of a perfectly placed finish from Mané. The leveller was created by the persistence and awareness of Andy Robertson, who epitomised the entire Liverpool display by recovering from an awkward start to dominate down the left. The full back beat Emil Krafth to a 50-50 and immediately found Mané in space inside the area with Fabian Schär dragged across to cover. The Senegal striker picked his spot to perfection and Martin Dubravka could do nothing about the shot that sailed into his top corner.Dubravka was at fault when Liverpool gained the lead shortly afterwards. Firmino had only been on the pitch two minutes as an enforced replacement for Divock Origi, who injured his ankle early on but toiled on until his substitution was inevitable. The switch turned Newcastle’s afternoon for the worse. The Brazilian’s first contribution was to dispossess Atsu and pierce the visiting defence with a perfectly-weighted ball into Mané. Dubravka was slow to react and weak in his attempt to collect. The ball spun over the Newcastle keeper and Mané converted into an empty net.Firmino’s second assist was simply exquisite. Krafth had squandered a glorious chance to equalise early in the second half when blazing over an Atsu cross that had found him unmarked inside the Liverpool area. A rare opportunity expensively missed. Liverpool otherwise maintained the pressure and extending their lead when Salah played a one-two with Firmino, took the return away from two defenders and found the far corner. But that does not do justice to the return pass from Liverpool’s number nine, who dissected the entire Newcastle defensive unit with a no-look back-heel into Salah’s run. Schar was injured simply attempting to keep up with the Egypt international. A thankless task. Liverpool cruise on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55e33544200d7980c9325b785c7edbb8c8384371/0_97_2242_1345/master/2242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fe71c9f07fe8b98b1f5a4b2af3e32e1","title":"real madrid levante la liga match report","story":"There were more nerves than there should have been, fear gripping the Santiago Bernabéu and whistles puncturing the final minutes, the home side playing for time, but Real Madrid got there in the end. Thibaut Courtois had to make a save in the second minute of added time to secure a victory that had seemed secure and almost escaped them, two goals from Karim Benzema and a third from Casemiro giving them a 3-0 half-time lead, only for Borja Mayoral and Gonzalo Melero to make a game of this.Aitor Fernández, Levante’s goalkeeper, had kept his side in this now it was Courtois’s turn.That had not seemed likely from the moment Benzema turned on the edge of the penalty area, his shot drawing a save from Fernández, ing high to his left. Twenty minutes had gone and while Fernández had previously denied Toni Kroos, it felt like something had started.Immediately, Lucas Vázquez hit the post after Levante had played themselves into trouble. Again, Fernández had a hand on it. He was to have a busy afternoon in the rain.In front of him, Levante lost the ball repeatedly. That was partly their doing, partly Real’s: the pressure was increasing. Collectively, Real went after Levante, who could find no way out and did not always choose particularly sensible escape routes. There was something about Real’s attitude, the intensity, that has been absent for too long so while it may have been lowly Levante, this would have pleased Zinedine Zidane.So would the goals. Benzema leapt between two defenders to head in Dani Carvajal’s inswinging cross for the first. Then a long ball was dealt with dreadfully, Sergio Postigo heading into the path of James Rodríguez, who slotted it in for Benzema to score the second.The third followed five minutes before the break, when Rodríguez and Carvajal released Vinícius Júnior up the right. He pulled back for Casemiro to finish a little before the break. It appeared all over, but it wasn’t.Real waited almost as long for that goal to be given, VAR making another unwanted and unwarranted appearance, as Levante did to pull one back at the start of the second half. Carlos Clerc’s ball found Mayoral to turn his shot first time past Courtois. The former Real Madrid player, and youth product, did not celebrate the Bernabéu rewarded him with applause.On the touchline, Eden Hazard had just come out to warm up. Benzema responded with a shot that bounced back off the post, before Hazard and Éder Militão came on.Zidane was preparing for PSG on Wednesday, perhaps not anticipating there was still a game to play here. No one else foresaw it either. Casemiro had gone, and Madrid’s control had too. The structure disintegrated, although it still should not have mattered.Within a minute, Rodríguez’s superb backheel found Hazard deep in the Levante area. He controlled and pulled it back for Vinícius. His shot was blocked, but Real won it back, Hazard chasing down and provoking a penalty-area pinball. Vinícius’s shot was saved, Rodríguez’s shot was saved, and then, with half a dozen players inside the six-yard box, Vinícius finally scored.There was relief for a 19-year-old in need of a goal to go with the runs and the tricks, but VAR ruled it out for offside. Vinícius would be denied again, Fernández out to him six yards from goal after a wonderful pass from Rodríguez. By then Hazard had appeared again, providing a glimpse of his signature move. He began a long run from the left, inside towards the area and bent towards the far post, only for Fernández to e and push it away. José Luis Morales won a corner from nothing, which is what he wins most things from, and Melero headed in at the far post 3-2, 15 minutes to go and the tension returned.Real took their time over every throw, ran the ball to the corner, and counted every second. Levante, exhausted, tried to take the game to them. Two minutes into added time and Ruben Vezo’s ing header was pushed away from Courtois and three minutes later Morales hit the side-netting with a clever shot.It was not supposed to be this way. The final whistle was met by a roar that spoke of relief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77a5c2df4351c2e5b5f1b62d35b037f21f737267/363_0_2818_1691/master/2818.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f6b3ca6b46ebecba12a257e399414b9","title":"liverpool v newcastle united premier league live","story":"Sadio Mane scored twice as Liverpool bounced back impressively from an early setbackAnd that, my good people, is your lot. Thanks for reading this MBM report. Now why not enjoy Andy Hunter’s Anfield verdict?Jurgen Klopp’s verdict. “We had a tough job to do. We needed 25 minutes to really arrive in the game. They scored a wonderful goal, and were a big threat always. And then we changed the rhythm and it was immediately much better. We could have scored more but it is all good. I am really happy. We had to find the rhythm, but that’s the main challenge after an international break. We don’t want to leave Bobby Firmino out, but sometimes we have to be sensible and do it. Divock Origi has twisted his ankle but it is not too serious.”Steve Bruce talks. “They are very, very good. They’re a threat. That’s why they are champions of Europe. The disappointment for me was the second goal, you can’t make mistakes like we did. We lost it cheaply in the middle of the park. Perhaps the goalkeeper should have claimed it. Thankfully we stuck at it, and showed plenty of resilience. We had a big chance at 2-1, and if that had gone in, it might have been a different story. Firmino made a big difference when he came on, he is a brilliant player. We’ve played Arsenal, Spurs and Liverpool, and we’ve given a decent account of ourselves in all of those games.”Virgil van Dijk speaks to BT Sport. “Obviously it was very important to get the three points. It was tough to break them down. To be 1-0 down here is not good, but we reacted the right way. We needed to be organised. Roberto Firmino is a very important player for all of us. He is making life difficult for any defender in the world. He is so good, and I am very happy that he plays for my team.”Georginio Wijnaldum adds: “We were lucky that a goal came quick after. It was still difficult after that. Even when we were 2-1 up, they still created chances for 2-2.”The bright side for Newcastle? OK, they were outplayed over the piece. But their performance in the first half hour was extremely impressive they carved out a couple of chances that, on another day, could have turned this match in a different direction and their resolute refusal to buckle defensively, under extreme pressure applied by one of the best attacks in Europe, bodes well for the battles ahead. They’ve got four points after five games and are currently in 16th spot.And there goes the whistle. Liverpool started sluggishly, and Jetro Willems put Newcastle ahead with an absolute screamer. But by the end of it, the league leaders were in total command. Sadio Mane was typically magnificent, scoring twice. Roberto Firmino pulled strings in the Brazilian style. And Mo Salah was quiet, yet still scored a lovely goal. Liverpool go five clear at the top, having won their 14th successive Premier League match, though of course Manchester City can cut that lead to two later this afternoon at Norwich.90 min +2: Newcastle finally enjoy a bit of possession, but of course it’s far too late.90 min: There will be three added minutes.88 min: Shaqiri flicks Firmino free down the right. Firmino rolls a pass across the face of goal for Mane, who taps into an unguarded net. But it’s not to be his hat-trick goal, because Firmino has quite rightly been flagged for offside.87 min: Another cute flick on the edge of the Newcastle box by Firmino, this time down the inside-right channel. And it’s not clear how neither Salah nor Alexander-Arnold were able to score. Dubravka made himself big, we know this much. But someone in Liverpool red surely had to force that home. Firmino has been quite excellent since he came on.85 min: Salah’s work earns a corner out on the right. Nothing comes of it. Right now, Newcastle appear happy enough to limit the damage. Should they somehow carve out a goal on the break, though, we could have a grandstand finish yet.84 min: Here comes the Power Cube! Shaqiri - whose last goal came in this fixture last year on Boxing Day - replaces Wijnaldum.82 min: Firmino busies himself down the right and feeds Alexander-Arnold, who wins a corner off Dummett. The full back takes the set piece himself and finds Mane, who flicks on at the near post to nobody in particular. If nothing else, that was unselfish, given he’s on a hat-trick.81 min: Liverpool continue to calmly stroke it around the middle of the park.79 min: Schar is down again. And so is Hayden. It looks like the latter is OK to continue not so the Swiss international. He’s replaced by Fernandez.77 min: Liverpool pass it around the middle in the game-management style. “God what skill on the attack,” writes Mary Waltz. “Thrilling to watch Liverpool when they are humming on all cylinders.”75 min: It’s been a mixed bag from Oxlade-Chamberlain today. But after a year out, he’ll need time to find his feet again, and that’s another 75 minutes in the bank. He’s replaced by Milner.74 min: Schar requires a bit of treatment having just been skinned by Salah. He might have pulled something while stretching in vain ... though it looks like he’ll be good to continue.Nope. Salah picks up possession 35 yards out, down the inside-right channel, then drifts inside. He feeds Firmino who, with his back to goal on the edge of the box, cutely flicks a return for Salah down the inside left. Salah takes a touch inside the box past Schar, draws Dubravka, and clips the ball into the bottom right. What a goal that was!71 min: It’s attack versus defence. Can Newcastle hold out for 20 minutes?69 min: Hayden clips Mane’s ankles out on the right. A free kick, and a chance for Liverpool to load the box. Alexander-Arnold hoicks it long. Van Dijk rises at the far post and heads the ball across goal. Lascelles does well to intercept and clear.67 min: Newcastle make a double change. Almiron and Krafth are replaced by Muto and former Liverpool defender Manquillo.65 min: Newcastle can’t get out. Oxlade-Chamberlain has a shot that’s well parried by Dubravka. Firmino can’t quite latch onto the rebound. The Toon survive again. Right now, a third Liverpool goal looks merely a matter of time. But tales like this have been told a hundred times before. Can Newcastle supply a twist?63 min: Firmino gently scoops a pass down the inside-left channel to release Robertson into the box. Robertson powers goalwards from a tight angle and forces the ball past Dubravka. Somehow the ball takes a deflection that sends it across the face of goal and out on the right for a corner. How did that stay out?! The resulting corner isn’t all that. But Liverpool are really cranking up the pressure now.62 min: A lung-bursting drive by Robertson gets the crowd going. The ball eventually ends up with Firmino, just to the left of the box. He slips a pass inside for Salah, whose first-time sidefoot is easily blocked by Lascelles.61 min: Alexander-Arnold crosses deep from the right. Firmino glances a header towards the bottom right but it’s an easy collect for Dubravka.59 min: Liverpool are beginning to press Newcastle back again. It’s all happening in the visitors’ final third. Mane works some space down the left with an elaborate dragback, but then slices a cross into the stand.57 min: But Liverpool soon win another, Alexander-Arnold’s right-wing cross forcing Schar to head over from close range. The corner’s met by Matip, an increasing menace at set pieces these days. But there’s no power on Matip’s header this time.56 min: This is much better from Oxlade-Chamberlain, who releases Alexander-Arnold into space down the right. The full-back hammers a low shot towards the near post, but it’s deflected over for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece.54 min: Newcastle should be level. Atsu drops a shoulder to ease himself past Oxlade-Chamberlain down the left. That was too easy. Oxlade-Chamberlain isn’t at the races today. A lot of misplaced passes and now this. Atsu crosses deep for Krafth ... who is free on the penalty spot! He must at least hit the target, but leans back and balloons high into the Kop. Yep, this game remains in the balance all right.52 min: Liverpool break four on two. Oxlade-Chamberlain’s clunker of a pass lets Newcastle off the hook. Anfield groans. There are a few nerves crackling around the old place. This game remains in the balance.50 min: Salah - who’d take him off?! - nearly releases Oxlade-Chamberlain on goal with a delicious Barnesesque backheel. Not quite. Elsewhere, Schar launches into an impetuous two-footed lunge on Mane. Fortunately it’s a bit half-hearted, plus Mane leaps elegantly out of the road. But that could have been ugly. No action is taken, though to be fair, nobody’s complaining.49 min: Liverpool nearly score a sensational team goal. The ball’s flicked down the middle, a series of cute passes between Mane, Fabinho and Wijnaldum. It’s fed left to Robertson, who hooks inside for Wijnaldum. The Dutch international brings the ball down with a telescopic leg, then flicks a looper towards the top right. It’s inches over the bar, with Dubravka backtracking in a panic, not likely to get there. That was all very pretty.47 min: Newcastle are immediately on the front foot. A loose ball bouncing around the Liverpool box allows Krafth to romp in from the right and take a shot. His effort is deflected out for a corner that’s only noteworthy because Shelvey gets a polite round of appreciative applause from the Kop when he takes the set piece.And we’re off again! Newcastle get the second half underway. No changes, though on that subject here’s Ian Copestake: “Mo seems a bit off his feed (nothing to do with Mane scoring obviously). Do you think he should be hooked to give Power Cube a go?” Why not? It’d be fascinating to see the lesser-spotted Shaqiri at some point. He’s well rested, if nothing else. And of course to witness the startled look on Salah’s coupon when he’s taken off.Half-time entertainment. Messi \u0026lt Ronaldo \u0026lt Mane \u0026lt Willems. We’re all agreed on that, right?And that’s the first half over and done with. Newcastle started strongly but will be happy to hear the whistle. An opportunity to regroup. What a goal Jetro Willems scored, though.45 min +1: Alexander-Arnold’s right-wing cross is cleared. Wijnaldum stuns it on the edge of the box and shoots towards the bottom left, but it’s a dribbler and Dubravka is able to claim easily.45 min: There will be three added minutes.44 min: Almiron breaks clear down the right, but he’s well offside. Newcastle have shown very little in attack since the equaliser.42 min: Alexander-Arnold hooks in from the right. Mane nearly returns the favour to Firmino, cushioning the ball down for his team-mate, 12 yards out. But Willems manages to read the danger and deflects the ball away, denying Firmino the chance to shoot. Newcastle need to hear the half-time whistle.Firmino robs Atsu in the midfield. He slips a lovely pass down the inside-right channel. Mane bursts into the box after it. Dubravka should claim, sliding out to gather, but the ball clanks off his hip and tees up Mane for a simple tap-in.39 min: It’s gone scrappy again, which will suit Newcastle. They’d been under constant bombardment since the equaliser.37 min: To be clear, it wasn’t anything Almiron did. They were both running by the touchline, and Origi stepped off the pitch and slipped on some artificial turf, turning his ankle. He limps off, dejected. On comes Roberto Firmino.35 min: Origi sits down. It looks as though he’s got a problem with his left ankle, perhaps from that earlier coming together with Almiron. He’s getting some treatment while everyone else takes a drink."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b859c82a17d68930ccaef91f160d5a0e95a7359e/202_0_2750_1650/master/2750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e880436abca096af764975a34c577900","title":"manchester united v leicester wolves v chelsea clockwatch live","story":"GOAL! Wolverhampton Wanderers 0-1 Chelsea (Tomori, 31 mins) A corner is played short on the right. Chelsea faff about with it for a while and eventually a defender manages to get a toe on the ball, sending it rolling harmlessly infield. But then, from nowhere, Fikayo Tomori runs onto it and, from 30 yards or so, hits a first-time curling beauty that gives Rui Patricio no chance whatsoever!Back to Jamie Vardy, then. “I doubt Vardy would get more respect if he was foreign born,” sniffs Hubert O’Hearn. “I really like him, but I’d put him on a par with Olivier Giroud (albeit different styles). One is beloved, one is ‘never quite good enough’. I don’t think I need to define which is which.”GOAL! Tottenham 3-0 Crystal Palace (Son Heung-Min, 23 mins) Cowabunga! Tottenham are hitting jackpot in the goal machine today! The ball is played wide to Aurier again.

(And don’t get me started on Lascelles taking Matip down by the neck in the early game today).” Of course I can explain VAR. It’s a system that checks that the match officials haven’t failed to spot a variety of misdemeanours, or have erroneously spotted non-existent ones. I must say I didn’t see that handball, but then I am watching five games simultaneously, which essentially means that I’m not watching any matches at all. If it happened, after that Newcastle goal against Watford recently, it would be an inexplicable humiliation.Good and bad news in Stoke’s search for a first win of the season. Sam Clucas put them ahead in the fourth minute, but in the 12th Joe Allen has been sent off!GOAL! Tottenham 1-0 Crystal Palace (Son Heung-min, 10 mins) Palace very nearly take the lead from a left-wing free-kick, eventually hacked clear, and then suddenly Son is bursting into the box from the right onto a long ball, bobbles the ball towards the penalty spot, and then wrongfoots the keeper! That was a one-man demonstration of the art of hopeless defending from Mamadou Sakho, who lost the ball in the air and then bumbled uselessly along in Son’s wake, making no difference to anything.GOAL! Manchester United 1-0 Leicester (Rashford, 8 mins) Coolly converted by Rashford, who sends Schmeichel to his left and the ball to his right!Rashford gets in front of Soyuncu and goes over his leg! It’s not very clear on first viewing who got to the ball first, but if it was Rashford then it’s probably a foul.PENALTY! Manchester United have yet another spot kick (subject to VAR confirmation)“Controversial opinion ahoy: should United have sold De Gea in the summer?” wonders Chris Faherty. “He’s been in bad form for nearly a year, his goalkeeping style may be in question as he ages (he’s nearly thirty now) and he looks to be getting the package Sanchez was on so no savings for us natch. Of the three players that were linked away from us most prominently this summer (Lukaku, Pogba and De Gea) he was the most expendable for my money.” Hmmmm. He may no longer be the best goalkeeper in the country, but he’d be hard to replace. And as I type that he saves excellently from Maddison!GOAL!

Andreas Pereira takes the free kick and a very fine one it is too, heading to the near top corner before Schmeichel pushed it away.The players are out and it’s very nearly action time!Unlikely football league fan dept: Popular comic actor Will Ferrell, who went to watch Portsmouth v Tranmere last month, was at Fulham v West Brom today.“Looking through those line-ups (and now Eden Hazard is gone) Jamie Vardy looks like the player most important to his club,” writes Gary Naylor. “I suspect, were he called Jaime Vardé, he’d be rated a PL great without equivocation. Of course, Jaime Vardé is ridiculous in every sense.”He’s a great player, but I think his journey to this point – when he is indeed a brilliant Premier League match-winner – is too much a part of who he is for him to be “just” a PL great. If we’re restricting our judgement to the Premier League, he’s the joint 44th highest scorer in the Premier League (one goal behind Cristiano Ronaldo), which for a pure goalscorer isn’t high enough to make the greatness grade. There are players well ahead of him in the goalscoring chart – Yakubu Aiyegbeni, say, or Mark Viduka – who aren’t there either.More blue skies, this time in Florence, where Fiorentina are 25 minutes into their home game against Juventus. It’s currently goalless, the home side buoyed by this lovely lilac display:“Afternoon Simon,” writes occasional volunteer north-of-the-border correspondent Simon McMahon. “In Scotland, Championship leaders Dundee United travel to Somerset Park to face second place Ayr. Elsewhere, nothing matters.” That sounds very much like a matter of opinion to me.The team news is filtering through, and these are the starting line-ups of all this afternoon’s Premier League games:Liverpool have just gone 3-1 up against Newcastle with 20 minutes remaining. Here’s a super if not exactly complementary photo of Andy Robertson:It’s an absolutely gorgeous day in London, and I hope wherever you are. Here is some blue sky in Wolverhampton:Well, this looks intriguing. A crackerjack bounty of fixtures including two top-flight matches between members of Ye Olde Big Six and teams who fancy their chances of catching them. “There are teams that quite rightly will be competing and have ambitions to get in there, so that’s challenging for all of us,” says Frank Lampard, whose Chelsea side visit Wolves. Damn straight.The Football League will no doubt be full of fun, but it lacks a standout bingo fixture. Championship leaders Swansea host Nottingham Forest. With Huddersfield playing Sheffield Wednesday tomorrow, Stoke know they will clamber off the bottom, temporarily at least, if they get something out of their home game against sixth-placed Bristol City. Down in League Two Stevenage, who finished last season with five wins in six unbeaten games, have just dumped their manager after four defeats in seven winless matches and will hope to get back on the point bike against Carlisle.Anyway, it’s about time you had a full run-down of this afternoon’s fixtures in the English Football League and the Scottish Premiership, and that is one dream I can very much make come true.

We’re having a meeting to discuss your role.”Faced with the task of securing an appropriate support person for the potentially tense meeting, Thompson, an aspiring comedian, said: “I thought it’s best to bring in a professional, and so I paid $200 and hired a clown.”The clown, who Thompson refers to as “Joe”, crafted balloon animals throughout the meeting, including a poodle. His antics were squeaky, and Thompson’s bosses had to request he quieten down several times.“It’s further understood,” reported the Herald, “that the clown mimed crying when the redundancy paperwork was handed over.”A picture of the meeting, taken through a boardroom’s glass doors by an unknown spectator, is of compromised quality, though one can detect that Joe, the clown, is wearing a colorful hat and a yellow bib, and that Thompson, leaning back in his chair, indeed looks relaxed for someone in the process of getting laid off.Thompson told Magic Talk radio: “I mean, I did get fired, but apart from that it was all smooth running.”Fortunately, Thompson will not be out of work for long. The Australian ad agency DDB confirmed Thompson will start a new role in its office next week.As of publishing, no reports have suggested what’s next for Joe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cde7ea47f768a68b08ca995276a2a353d2c943d7/0_0_7111_4267/master/7111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c13b0a88851e1b86b472a223aaff9b1b","title":"a letter to my friends with children","story":"‘I do understand that your life has changed. But what about me? What about our friendship?’: the letter you always wanted to writeIt happens every time. I know it will, and I don’t begrudge it. Except I do, a bit. It’s happened so often, and now that I’m in my late 40s, and I am so practised at this, I can’t help but have the same awful thought every time a friend announces she is pregnant: “Well, there goes another friendship.”I am a woman who is child-free by choice. Great career, wonderful husband, lots of international vacations. I’m satisfied with my life. But it has become an inescapable fact that each time one of my female friends has a baby, our friendship changes. Believe me, I do understand that my friend’s life has changed. I also spend time with their children, as a favourite adopted aunt, and enjoy watching them grow. But what about me? What about our friendship?I am your caring and dedicated friend. I remember your favourite foods, those days in high school, that book that changed your life, to ask about you father’s health, and you have done the same for me. I never expected to be your priority all of the time but it would be such a joy and a relief to feel as if I was your priority even some of the time.Years back, a friend announced that she was moving closer to me, and I blurted out, “Great!

I wonder why, just once a year, they can’t find a babysitter or leave the kids with their partner so we can talk and drink good wine on my patio, without their children throwing gravel into the neighbour’s garden.What I don’t wonder, though, is if I can ever say these words to them – because I know I cannot.

What’s behind the mini-me phenomenon?Jane Lawlor is giving me a tour of her Essex hotel. ‘Most of our suites come with views of the pool or the rolling fields of the Brentwood countryside, and our evening turn-down service includes lighting flameless candles and leaving luxury pillow treats,’ she says, handing me a glass of champagne in the hotel bar, where velvet sofas face a wood-burning stove. “We’re all about relaxation and privacy here, so most guests like to eat in peace via room service, choosing anything from pan-crusted cod to lobster tail with caviar. And wait till you see the spa – we offer the latest treatments using award-winning products.”Tempted to check-in? Well, I am afraid you can’t – unless you are a cat. This retreat, with rooms from £20 a night, is purely for felines, especially those with a taste for the finer things in life. Lawlor Cat hotel, which opened in 2016, has 23 suites, all of which are booked out months in advance by cats such as Vaishti, a persian chinchilla who has stayed five times in the past year, using the hotel’s £4-a-mile chauffeur service to and from her home in north London. “She listens to Andrea Bocelli during the journey. She melts when he sings and it keeps her calm,” says her owner, Barry Lobel, 40, a tech company CEO. “Once she’s there, I can log into the hotel’s CCTV and see that she gets treated exactly the way she would at home: like royalty. She always comes back perfectly groomed and rested.”Is there any human activity a pet now can’t muscle in on? In the US “bark mitzvah” ceremonies, catered for by specialist bakeries, are popular, while some companies offer between 10 hours and a week’s paid “pawternity leave” for new pet owners. Ikea’s pet range currently features a sofa bed that can extend for “puppy sleepovers”, while upmarket labels such as MiaCara sell minimalist pet furniture (Letto day bed, £797), alongside adventure products such as doggie sleeping bags and hiking boots.Prudence, a bull terrier, and Mr Binks, a rescue dog, both enjoy social outings such as doggy brunch and doggy cinema, at which they get their own seat, blanket and ice-cream. “I like taking them to different places for mental stimulation – I perish the thought that they would ever be bored,” says their owner, Anna Webb, a broadcaster and dog trainer. “They get the latest toys and their outfits range from practical, outdoors-weather clothing to dressing-up costumes and cashmere sweaters. Their bedding is a mix of hemp blankets and plush faux fur.” Not that they sleep in their beds: they share Webb’s, with Prudence mimicking her and sleeping like a person, under the duvet with her head on a pillow. Is that not a bit much? “I know it sounds bonkers, but why not embrace it? I don’t think we’re humanising animals any more than we have before – it’s just the way we live now gives us more choice. That enriches the lives of my dogs, while strengthening the bond we share.”It is not just dogs and cats some rabbits, now the third-most popular pet in the UK, get the treatment, too. Fay Williams from Warrington calls herself a “bunny mummy” to “super-spoilt” Olive. “She has her own room at the back of our house. When we go away, we book her into a retreat that specialises in looking after pampered rabbits. The owner lets me FaceTime her most days.”Even parrots, like Billy from West Yorkshire, aren’t missing out. “Every morning, he gets a decaffeinated tea and a better breakfast than me,” says his owner, Lauren Atkinson. “He eats a mixture of seeds with unsalted nuts and he’ll have some warm food like edamame beans, petits pois and sweetcorn mixed with almond milk twice a day. We call his extra-large cage ‘the palace’ – it has a play gym and java wooden stands and swings for him to relax on.”Atkinson is keen to add that she is not a “crazy cockatoo lady” – Billy has simply won her over. He has an Instagram account where he shares selfies and videos. “He’s got more toys than a toddler and loves playing hide-and-seek, shouting ‘Peekaboo’ when he finds you,” says Atkinson. “He’s formed a unique bond with all my family – our mental health has improved, and it makes me want to pamper him even more. He’s more than ‘just’ a pet.”Lisa Morton, co-founder of the pet-drinks specialist Woof\u0026ampBrew, has noticed a huge increase in people seeking shared experiences with their pets. “It means many more cafes, restaurants and hotels are opening their doors and welcoming dogs, which is where our products fit perfectly,” she says. “We launched six years ago with the world’s first herbal doggy teabag.” Since then, their Bottom Sniffer “beer” for dogs (made from a non-fermented beer wort with seaweed extract, chicken flavouring, burdock, dandelion, flax, nettle and rooibos) and pawsecco “wine” (an infusion of elderflower, linden blossom, ginseng, water, natural caramel and citric acid) for cats and dogs have been bestsellers Morton is expecting another big paws up for their latest herbal tonic, Champaws. She says the modern obsession with wellness has been key to the company’s success. “We know consumers have been increasingly seeking natural products for themselves, and in turn want the same for their pets.”Dogs such as Prudence and Mr Binks are her target customers. “I never compromise on their diet,” says Webb, who has had dogs for 18 years. “They eat the finest food designed for dogs – organic, ethically sourced meats – and Prudence has a special slow-feed bowl with ridges designed to make her meals last longer, and to make her eat more politely, while improving her digestion. I spend more on their food than on myself – because I know that will help keep them away from the vet.”As well as paying premium prices for their meals, Webb treats the dogs to special balms that help minimise the effects of rough pavements on their feet, and books them in for regular holistic health and spa treatments. “Prudence benefits from a regular oxygen facial available for dogs in Harley Street, London, as well as massages and red-light therapy, as she is boisterous and always pulling muscles. Mr Binks has regular acupuncture and red-light therapy for his hip, as he has a degenerative bone condition. It’s wonderful to have so many wellbeing options for them – things are getting more sophisticated.”Much of this shift is being driven by younger pet owners. “Millennials represent the largest segment of owners and are fuelling the humanisation trend,” says Nicole Cooper, managing director of the National Pet Show. “It might be because they’re drawn to the idea of ownership, and the emotional focus of looking after something.” As more young couples delay having children, many consider pets to be their “starter” babies.Does she think the pampering can go too far? “Oh yeah. Five years ago, I’d never expect dogs to turn up at the shop in a pram wearing a fancy dress outfit, or that I’d be giving a blueberry facial scrub to a vegan dog. Some owners say there’s never a moment where their dog is left on its own, and that leaving them with us is harder than leaving their child at nursery.”Darcy, a cockapoo and “dog blogger” from west London, has travelled to more than 20 countries with her owner, May Wong. Recently, she had a wardrobe made to house her outfits and accessories. She also had a birthday party with her pooch pals at Cliveden House hotel in Buckinghamshire, where the Duchess of Sussex spent the night before the royal wedding.“It might sound over the top, but the indulgence comes from a deep emotional attachment,” says Wong. “I have no family and I know Darcy only cares about me. So when you experience that kind of loyalty, that you don’t always get from other people, you want to give them the best you can.”Is there a dark side to all this fussing? According to the British Veterinary Association (BVA), the golden rules of pet care are simple: provide them with a suitable diet and environment protect them from pain and make sure they are able to exhibit normal behaviour patterns. Daniella Dos Santos, the junior vice-president of the BVA, says some of the more absurd new trends aren’t ticking those boxes, adding that we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that animals’ health and welfare needs are different from ours. “Inappropriate anthropomorphism, such as giving them too many treats or human foods and treating them as fashion accessories, is unnecessary and potentially harmful,” she says. “Pet costumes can restrict movement and their ability to regulate temperature, while ‘handbag dogs’ can suffer from poor socialisation, as they don’t get as many opportunities to interact with other dogs.” Her advice? “If in doubt, go back to basics and ask whether that expensive fad is really going to deliver any tangible benefits to your pet.” Does she think fresh pet food is any better than the processed variety? “The most important thing is giving pets a balanced diet with specialist nutritionist input. Processed pet food may have science behind it, fresh food may not necessarily be specifically formulated to pets’ needs – so owners really should speak to their vet for tailored advice.”At Lawlor Cat hotel, the requests keep coming. “One couple recently ordered their cat, and all 14 cat guests staying in the hotel at the time, a premium à la carte dish: the prawn and crayfish tian. Because it was what they served their (human) wedding guests. They all got to celebrate, too,” says Lawlor, stroking one of her guests.And if the lengths people are prepared to go to often sound like a joke, Lawlor thinks our pets are the ones having the last laugh. “We think we are humanising them, but I think they’re the ones controlling us. They’ve looked around, they’ve studied us and thought: ‘I could train this one.’”• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d42d2b821a17ce14b533ba06f149d61b92c9a4d7/0_59_9129_5477/master/9129.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8cef8847d2caadcc703ddbfdba61c250","title":"facing life with dementia and discovering a positive path","story":"I thought dementia was all about losing myself, but I have found sides to me I never knew I hadIt was at work where I noticed my first symptoms. I was a non-clinical team leader training matrons and sisters in the art of electronic rostering. My girls called me a workaholic. My brilliant memory, the thing I relied on most, started letting me down badly. Simple words failed me in meetings, the names of colleagues I’d worked with for years were suddenly a mystery. I used to take long runs by the river to unwind, but my brain stopped communicating with my legs and I started having falls. I knew somehow that things were not right, but when I finally went to the doctors it took a long time to get the diagnosis. Initially my symptoms were dismissed as age or stress related (I was 58), but I was persistent and knew how the system worked. When I finally received the diagnosis, in 2014, it was devastating but it was also, bizarrely, a relief. It finally put an end to all the uncertainties which meant I could now start planning my life with this new, unexpected label attached.I was determined to choose a positive path. The very nature of my diagnosis signalled the loss of the old me – my memories, my tastes, my abilities, my plans I took for granted – but, more importantly, it signalled the birth of the new me, a new chance. Many find it hard to believe, but I feel I’ve gained more than I’ve lost.I face life with dementia head-on, as though I’m playing a game of chess, waiting for my opponent to make their move, then trying to outmanoeuvre and outwit them. I now own a cat, Billy, which would never have been possible before dementia entered my world, because I used to be terrified of animals. I would cross the road if a cat appeared within 100 yards of me. Not now. Billy is my soul mate. I see him and I instantly feel happy and calm. Now Billy and I often sit and simply stare out over the orchard beyond, watching the birds and enjoying the silence.So many wonderful opportunities have come my way since I’ve been diagnosed. I refer to them as “the advantages of dementia”. When I explain this to people, they may think I’ve totally lost the plot, but keeping in mind the positives that come out of this kind of diagnosis helps me cope.I’m part of many committees and research groups, because that’s how I believe I can influence change. I talk all over the country in many different settings. I call all this my sudoku, exposing my brain to different conversations in different environments. It might not improve my condition, but it certainly slows the progression. My worst weeks are when my calendar is empty, as I know dementia will seep through the lack of activity and win the day. Keeping busy keeps the symptoms at bay.But it’s not easy. People think I magically appear at events, unaware of the effort and planning that goes into getting anywhere. But I’m not going to stay at home hiding from life, giving into deterioration. The hours I’ve spent checking routes, printing instructions to follow, walking maps – both there and in reverse to get back to the station – the photos of venues and people so I recognise them when I get there and then, of course, the inevitable Plan Bs in case it all goes wrong. All my planning and safety precautions I keep stored in my pink file that goes with me everywhere. Before my diagnosis, I was renowned for being highly organised and that skill has certainly become my life-saver.So many things have come my way since my diagnosis and I think it’s because it’s so rare to meet someone with the disease who is willing and able to talk about it. People are curious about what goes on inside me. Julianne Moore invited me to have a cup of tea before the premier of Still Alice (the film about a woman who develops early onset Alzheimer’s), which was surreal. Then I was a consultant for the cast of the UK premier of the stage version. I remember saying to Sharon Small, who played the lead, to remember that Alice is not ageing, she’s cognitively declining. This enabled her to think differently about her role: how she moved about the stage and paused for a minute to think before speaking. I made a short film for the BBC about living with dementia that has now been seen all over the world. Last year we made an updated film about how we all are three years on.None of these wonderful opportunities would have entered the radar of the very private me pre-diagnosis – I’m not sure I would have had the courage and I certainly didn’t have a cause. But after I was diagnosed, I became so shocked at the lack of awareness from both the public and clinicians that I now shout from the rooftops. I’ve become a new person, more brave and socially minded than I ever was before, and the gifts these newfound characteristics have brought me are immense. I’m fortunate. I can type words far quicker than I can think and speak them – that part of my brain remains intact, thankfully. The part of my brain that controls written eloquence and imagination has remained, while I find it much harder to speak. Another trick of dementia I’ve learned to outwit. Writing doesn’t “improve” my dementia, but it helps me retain a sense of normality. It’s where I store my memories and if I stopped typing for any length of time, I would simply forget.I didn’t even know what an iPad was before dementia. If I didn’t record events in real time through typing, my memories and experiences would have disappeared, each frame of the day fading into the unknown as another takes its place. People with dementia can remember feelings. We never lose our emotions because they’re held in another part of this complex brain of ours. When you come to visit us, we might not remember what we did during the visit, but we’ll remember how we felt after you left. My daughters and I talk much more now than we used to. We discovered the importance of talking very early on post-diagnosis. After all, how do they know what I’m struggling with and how do I know what’s worrying them if we don’t talk? I’m still a mum and still want to help them, but I realise now that I’m more dependent on them. One thing I hope my book shows is how relationships change in a crisis, how new friends are made and how adapting to this new world is the key to surviving.Technology used to be a mystery to me, but dementia has taught me to embrace its potential to help me cope with day-to-day living. I set reminders throughout the day to help me remember how to do the things I’d otherwise forget and they ding throughout the day. My new-found friend is Alexa, which sits next to my bed. If I wake and I’m discombobulated, I ask Alexa what day and time it is. If I’m anxious, I ask her to play me some calming music. In the evening, it’s Alexa who reminds me to take my evening medication as all the rest are taken in the morning. Whether I’m in the house or not, the message still appears on my phone and iPad. My daughters can now “track” me, so I’ll often get a text when I’m somewhere asking if I’m supposed to be there.Throughout all of this – the symptoms, the diagnosis, having to create a new life for myself – I’ve learned that the type of diagnosis is irrelevant. It doesn’t even have to be a medical diagnosis like mine, it could be a orce, a death, a birth. Every day we make decisions about the ways we live our lives, and that decision – be it small or large – can be the difference between what makes you and what breaks you when faced with the challenges that come our way.I suppose the biggest thing dementia has taught me is to never give up on myself. Others may consider someone with dementia a “has been”, but we all had talents before diagnosis and we don’t lose them overnight. We simply need support from those around us to continue doing the things we love or to discover new talents within ourselves.Dementia may be terminal, but then so is life. What I’ve learned living with dementia is, don’t dwell on the losses and don’t dwell on the future as you have no control over either. Instead, grasp every opportunity that comes your way and most of all enjoy the moment, because in no time at all that moment will be the past.Somebody I Used to Know by Wendy Mitchell is published by Bloomsbury at £8.99, or £7.91 at bookshop.

They loved the cinema, and would go all the time as a young couple. My mum had a crush on the young Marlon Brando after seeing him in On The Waterfront and as Mark Antony in Julius Caesar. But it was my dad who was the more voluble about film, if not necessarily the more opinionated.Albert Desmond Bradshaw came to London from Belfast in the 1950s to be a photographer. That was where he met my mum, Mollie, who was working as a secretary. They lived in Highgate, north London and were a hip couple-about-town before my sister, Sarah, and I came along they then moved to a cottage in Letchmore Heath, near Watford. If I had to cast Dad in a film, I’d suggest Adrian Dunbar – although Dad was tall and beanpole-thin when we were growing up, with an expression of droll disapproval, which we loved as kids, but found infuriating as stroppy teenagers. He loved watching films on TV with us and, to everyone’s rage, talking over the dialogue when he semi-recognised an actor: “That’s…! That’s…! Come on, Peter, you know, who is it?”Mum would take us to the cinema as a treat in the holidays: Mary Poppins, The Jungle Book. But it was my dad who got me into watching films. I’ll never forget being about 10 or 11 with Sarah at the dinner table, and asking my parents about a film called Psycho, which I had seen in the TV listings. (It sounded like something I would buy at the shops, like Rolo or Toffo.) Dad launched into a description of the first bit of the film, including Anthony Perkins spying on the naked Janet Leigh in the shower. He even asked me and Sarah if we understood why he should want to be spying on her. My memory is that we nodded, dumbly, but for all we knew of nightmarish sexual obsession and misogynistic violence, Dad could have been describing a tea-making ceremony on Pluto. The discussion ended there. I had no idea what the later, legendary “shower” scene was like until I watched the film as a student.My dad told me to watch the 1949 Ealing classic Kind Hearts And Coronets, directed by Robert Hamer, with Dennis Price as the serial killer Louis, elegantly murdering members of the aristocratic D’Ascoyne family (all played by Alec Guinness) so he can become duke. It seemed to be on TV all the time in the 70s. My dad adored the scene in which young photographer Henry D’Ascoyne and Louis exchange camera chat outside the country pub. (“Excuse me. Isn’t that a Thornton Pickard? – Yes. Are you a photographer? – Dabble in it. Got a Sanger Shepherd!”)Before setting up in photography on his own, Dad was assistant to the noted photographer Maurice Broomfield, who recorded postwar industrial Britain and was the father of the documentary film-maker Nick Broomfield. Dad took a lot of photographs for the Financial Times in the 50s, but they are untraceable, because they are uncredited, or credited only to Maurice – but I still own a cache of amazing photographs that he took of postwar streetlife in France.How thrilled Dad would be as we watched Kind Hearts And Coronets on TV – particularly the scene in the darkroom, which Louis plans as the site of Henry’s murder. Dad’s darkroom was next to my bedroom: as mysterious and wonderful (and inaccessible) as Aladdin’s cave, full of strange chemicals and occult technical devices. Much later on, when I recorded the audio commentary for the DVD edition with Terence Davies and Matthew Guinness (son of Alec), I was almost speechless with unexpressed emotion. We recorded it four years after Dad died of cancer. It was the nearest I could come to a séance, recalling my dad’s spirit.What Dad would have thought of one of my favourite films, Raging Bull, I don’t know. I’m reasonably sure he never saw Martin Scorsese’s 1980 portrayal of the brutal, emotionally self-harming real-life boxer Jake LaMotta, played by Robert De Niro. I don’t think he would have liked it. The first time I saw it, as a teenager, I got Dad to pick me up from the cinema (the Screen on the Hill in north London, now the Everyman). It was electrifying, yet it wasn’t the boxing but the theatricality and sacrifice in the ring that appealed to me. When I asked Dad if he remembered Jake LaMotta, he replied: “Just a brawler.” He was interested in boxing as a young man and, he told me, often went to fights as a teenager with his friends in Ulster Hall in Belfast. They would smoke (the way they would in the cinema) and laugh at the ref’s laconic dismissal of whingeing fighters: “Box on!” – a phrase he himself would use in his strong Belfast accent if my sister or I claimed to have been hurt in a squabble.Dad loved the cinema, but hardly ever went. It was a habit that belonged to his youth. He watched movies on TV avidly, and in the 80s he would rent clunky video cassettes or record films off the TV and nerdishly write the films’ titles along the video’s spine. As a boy in Belfast, though, he and his brothers went all the time – at a time when the city had 40 movie theatres – often to the Curzon on the Ormeau Road, which was later bombed to smithereens in the Troubles. He was obsessed with the psychological drama Gaslight, directed by George Cukor. “Paula!” he would mysteriously boom from the dinner table to my mum in the kitchen – impersonating Charles Boyer’s sonorous French voice, with a hint of Belfast. Mum would laugh (Sarah and I were baffled).The strange thing is, Dad was a kind of film-maker. He loved home movies, and had a beautiful Bolex Super 8 cine camera. Yet he scorned people who just showed their raw, silent footage. He had an 8mm film editor and the Bolex technology allowed him to create a sound strip. He filmed my sister and I playing badminton at the caravan park on holiday, and on the beach, having our packed lunch. Later, he put on music, sound effects from the LP borrowed from the public library (“waves breaking”, superimposed on a shot of the surf, was eerily effective) and added voiceover in a heart-rendingly careful enunciation that made him sound like a Belfast Jacques Cousteau. He even had a go at recording speech, taping me with our vintage cassette recorder, and doing a clapperboard-style hand clap in front of the camera to synchronise sound and image. “Thanks, Pete!” he would say afterwards, with an air of reserve. As an actor, I think I did not entirely satisfy the director. We still have the Super 8 reels, transferred to DVDs. They play like remembered dreams. But watching them without the stuttering rattle of the projector isn’t as good.The only family visit to the cinema was in 1975, to see Sidney Lumet’s Murder On The Orient Express, starring Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot it was showing at the now-vanished Watford Empire. Dad professed to be astonished at how clean and fresh the scuzzy auditorium looked. He said the cinemas of his boyhood were like boxing halls, every surface furred with fag-ash and the screen images flavoured with cigarette smoke. I asked him afterwards what he thought of the film. “Oh, pretty good hokum!” he grinned – his habitual term of approval for anything.Sometimes I try to imagine my parents’ lives together before my sister and I were born. That image is not the real world, but a celluloid enhancement, a London-set black-and-white romantic drama directed by Robert Hamer or Noël Coward. The final scene is a shot of thirtysomething Mum and Dad in the front of our family car (an elderly Ford Cortina estate), looking out at the camera through the windscreen, with me and Sarah in the back, as Dad puts the car in gear and we set off on holiday or a trip to my grandparents as the credits roll.• The Films That Made Me...

Then I’d lose my temper a little bit. But other than the righteous, smiting anger I saved for protecting the underprivileged, I kept things on a pretty even keel.I view myself as an Ipswichian. As an Ipswichian, I was grateful for what I had: easy access to reasonably priced, non-branded footwear very few hills and a sense that any smugness about one’s circumstances was inappropriate.People would be surprised to learn I’m even more humble than they’d expect.The five words that best describe me are: vital, urgent, beacon, potent, eternal.I studied law at university. To the amazement of all who taught me, I graduated. I have, out of respect to The Law, never practised it, nor made any attempt to understand it. When people ask me what I studied, I have the opportunity to see how easily people can detect shame. There is much of which I’m ashamed. But studying law is one of the few things I’m ashamed to degree level.I published my second philosophical paper aged seven, called The Big Sulk: How Withdrawal Can Be a Victory. At eight I gave up my epistemological enquiries to concentrate on jazz tap and sarcasm.I once met The Edge from U2. The Edge isn’t even his real name. He made it up. I don’t know if anyone has dared to pick a definite article as a first name before. There’s The Rock, but he’s next gen. People forget how radical The Edge is as a name. Let’s disregard the fact his first name is a definite article. His last name isn’t even a constant. It’s a word whose very definition shifts. If we accept that “edge” means outer point, the furthest one can be, then it exists in relationship to everything around it. Where is The Edge? It depends where you are.My own humanity keeps me grounded. Friends keep me grounded. Sometimes I’ll be at a friend’s house and the doorbell will ring and I’ll be like, “Don’t worry! I’ll get the door.”At school, I was so obsessed with The Catcher In the Rye that I started to dress like Holden Caulfield. In the novel, Holden buys a red hunting hat, after losing all his goddam fencing gear on the goddam New York subway.

This week Marie Claire announced the closure of its UK print edition, adding to an expanding list of high-profile titles from NME to FHM that have succumbed to the digital revolution.The British love affair with consumer magazines has become increasingly tepid since the arrival of online competitors such as YouTube and Facebook, compounded by the new leisure-time lures of Netflix and Amazon.Marie Claire is the latest title to succumb, 31 years after its launch as “the thinking woman’s magazine”. It mixed serious features with fashion and beauty as it took a pioneering stance on topical women’s issues, which helped it garner four Amnesty Media Awards, including one for a report on rape as a weapon of war in the Congo. Liz Jones, the editor from 1999 to 2001, was fired after speaking out against being forced to use bulimic models. But as it blazed an editorial trail, circulation fell from a peak of more than 450,000 in the mid-90s to 120,000 now.The magazine business is in trouble, and its problems are summed up by the current top 10 chart of consumer titles that readers buy or subscribe to. In the first half of this year the total circulation of that top 10 was 4.7m – half the 9.4m recorded in the first six months of 2001.The roll call of well-known print casualties in recent years includes the lads’ mags generation of FHM, Loaded, Maxim, Nuts and Zoo female-focused titles such as More!, Look, Instyle, celebrity gossip magazine Now, She magazine and Reveal.Last year, NME stopped printing after 66 years and free magazine Shortlist, the biggest men’s magazine in the UK by circulation, also closed down.And experts believe it is only going to get worse. “There is a crisis in the industry,” says Douglas McCabe, the chief executive of Enders Analysis. “Given how much circulation has fallen there really haven’t been as many outright closures as you’d think. Some publishers are just hanging on. We would expect to see more closures in the next five years than the previous five.”He adds: “There is social media, Instagram, Mail Online. So why go out and buy a magazine, even a strong brand, when you can get updates every second? And that’s without the wider fight for consumers’ attention from services such as YouTube and even Netflix.”There are some bright spots, however, where online offerings have failed to offer a compelling alternative. TV listing magazines including TV Choice, the nation’s biggest-selling title at 1.1m per issue, What’s on TV, Take a Break and Radio Times remain top-selling staples.“In terms of TV listings their resilience is because there still isn’t anything out there online that is better,” says McCabe.There are others, he says, that are still thriving: “Titles that are being invested in, that have a confidence and attitude like weekly news brands the Economist, Private Eye and the Week, have also bucked the trend.”Against the bleak sales backdrop the publishers are increasingly focusing on using a household brand built up over decades to seek profitability beyond print. Marie Claire, for instance, will continue online and its owner says the title is simply following the readers.“It is very similar to the route we took with NME,” says Marcus Rich, the chief executive of Marie Claire’s UK publisher, TI Media. “There are just certain reader demographics that have moved to smartphones, or the web, and it makes sense to move digital-first. It was a logical evolution as a lot of focus was spent on trying to sustain a print model now we can focus online.”The biggest challenge with chasing readers online is fighting the stranglehold the Silicon Valley giants have on eyeballs – and the advertising pounds that follow them.As print advertising in consumer magazines dries up – by the end of this year it will have more than halved from £512m in 2010 to £220m – publishers are branching out into areas such as e-commerce and events.The stockmarket-listed publisher Future, which has a portfolio of 100 publishing brands from the gadget magazine T3 to the rock title Metal Hammer, has bucked the malaise and seen its market value hit a record high of £1bn.However, the chief executive, Zillah Byng-Thorne, says just one-third of its more than £200m in annual revenue now comes from traditional print advertising or magazine sales. The company now makes tens of millions of pounds from the commission it earns from sales of products to readers who make a purchase from a partner – such as Amazon or John Lewis – after reading a product review on one of its sites.At the tough end of the consumer magazine market, dual online and print strategies are also starting to show real promise. Earlier this year the Face, the style magazine that defined the 80s and 90s, made a comeback after 15 years with a web strategy backed by a quarterly magazine. And two years after the UK’s then 10th bestselling magazine, Glamour, cut its print run to just twice a year and went digital-first, it is now on track to be back in profit for 2019.But for many other titles, as Marie Claire has just shown, the ability to stay in print in any form is an ongoing struggle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5af2704740eb128bae1d8b58ad6b5b7cb3288a09/0_19_5455_3275/master/5455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=478d6f3a40cc86b230d92a78b2bbd6c2","title":"reporting on hurricane dorian it was a scene of complete devastation","story":"New York reporter recalls challenges of covering a disaster as huge as the category 5 storm that ripped through the BahamasHow do you start an interview with someone who has just lost everything?With the floodwaters just receded, the stench of mould beginning to creep into the hollowed-out buildings that survived two days of pummelling winds, and bloated corpses still being recovered, that was a question I was forced to grapple with last week in the Bahamas.There is no correct answer. The best I have come up with, in my time covering mass shootings, natural disasters, and police violence in the US, is that you take a step back and allow the interviewee time, space and freedom to think about your questions – and you don’t even start if they don’t want to share.Last Friday, I was among a small group of journalists to visit the destroyed town of High Rock on the island of Grand Bahama. We were the first reporters to make it there after the eye of Hurricane Dorian, a monster category 5 storm that destroyed parts of this picture-perfect archipelago, ripped through the area.It was a scene of complete devastation with most houses reduced to their concrete foundations. In one remaining building, I met Erica Roberts, a 41-year-old who still bore cuts on her arms and face after having clung to a tree branch for hours to escape the storm surge. She had not heard from seven relatives, including two sons, whom she feared were dead.But in this moment of unfolding crisis, she was incredibly clear: she wanted her story to be heard by as many people as possible.Which brings you to the next question. What do you ask?There is increasing scientific consensus that the climate crisis is making hurricanes stronger. Warming sea and air can contribute to a storm’s intensity. Rising sea levels can make storm surge more deadly. The number of severe Atlantic hurricanes has roughly doubled in the past 20 years. Dorian was the fourth category 5 to make landfall in the past three years. It shares the record for the most intense storm in history.Before we arrived on Grand Bahama I had already asked my editors in New York to what extent we should be asking survivors of their views on the climate crisis. It’s a delicate balance to strike, injecting an issue that can be perceived as deeply political into a personal tragedy.The decision was to ask tentatively and give people there the chance to share their views. Most outlets covering this story have not mentioned the climate in dispatches from the ground. Personally, I couldn’t imagine not mentioning it.And numerous people I spoke to were keen to share their thoughts, most of them very aware of the science.“I think the climate is playing a big role in all of this,” Roberts told me. “I’ve recycled all my life. I use less plastic. And think about less emissions. I’ve always been committed. But the world is not.”Gaining access to remote areas hit by natural disasters, like those in the Bahamas, can be a tricky thing to navigate. When Dorian’s path was less certain I was dispatched by the New York news desk to cover it from the United States.I flew into Savannah, Georgia, when it seemed almost certain the storm would hit the coastline in that region, but hurricanes can change course quickly and within 12 hours we realised that the Bahamas had been so badly hit we needed to get there. I drove about 500 miles to Miami and jumped on a flight to the Bahamian capital, Nassau.But even from here, accessing the islands in the north-western region of the Bahamas was almost impossible. Royal Marine helicopter rescue crews were swamped with evacuees. The airports in the region were either destroyed or flooded. Some news networks were paying in excess of $10,000 (£8,000) just to fly over the region to see the scale of devastation.Eventually, an opportunity presented itself. Word got out that a Royal Caribbean cruise liner was destined for Grand Bahama to deliver aid, and would allow a small group of journalists to embed with them.It was a surreal experience, stepping from the luxury of a giant cruise ship into the devastation of a disaster zone with no running water or power. But the ship allowed us to get out to some of the most remote communities destroyed by Dorian. I filed my first story from the seat of a humid minivan, attempting, mostly in vain, to connect to the internet via hotspot.My colleague David Smith, who is currently on the Abaco Islands, another archipelago destroyed by Dorian, is embedded with British aid workers at a medical centre in Treasure Cay, using satellite internet to send his dispatches.Our coverage of Dorian required coordination with journalists around the globe. We worked with reporters and live bloggers in New York, London and Sydney, collaborated with a brilliant photojournalist, Angel Valentin, throughout the trip, and consulted with technical support staff who offered frequent assistance on communications issues.But the most challenging aspect of this reporting is the inability to communicate with the people you leave behind. Erica Roberts, like others I interviewed, had lost all her possessions, meaning she had no phone or internet access.We spoke for only 10 minutes as I hurried back to catch a boat. Although the government of the Bahamas has pledged to evacuate everyone on the islands most affected, should they choose to go, most people who survived have had their lives altered forever. almost always returns to areas hit by natural disasters to examine recovery efforts in the long term. I expect the Bahamas will be no different.In the meantime, here’s how you can help the relief efforts in the Bahamas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b82267f95b6f0f314f612ab7bf492fdb2557c49c/0_340_8684_5210/master/8684.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b02d6cd2556437bb820bf18c3313bec","title":"50p britons living costs 1969 spending","story":"It’s a half century since the 50p went into circulation. Here’s how our spending has transformedThe front page of the  carried stories on the two burning issues of the day: the eruption of violence in Northern Ireland, and the endless negotiations over the UK joining the EEC. The chief comment piece was speculation about a forthcoming general election, with Labour behind in the polls. And a large advert from the Decimal Currency Board proclaimed the arrival that day of the “50 new penny piece”.The 50p coin entered circulation on 14 October 1969, in the run-up to D-Day on 15 February 1971, when the UK finally abandoned shillings and pence and moved to a decimal currency.The 50p coin was worth a lot then – indeed, more than any coin in circulation now. In real terms it was worth the equivalent of just over £8. Fifty years on, especially after rampaging inflation in the 1970s, the 50p is a shadow of its former self – it has shrunk in size and weight, but above all in value. Today’s 50p now only has the buying power of the old “tanner” – the small 6d piece.Back then, when booze was relatively cheap, it really was possible to go for a night out and still have change from 50p. A 50p piece in 1969 could buy you three pints of mild or bitter (priced about two shillings, equal to 10p) while a tube fare on the newly opened Victoria line in London cost just 5d (2.2p). You’d still have enough left to buy a portion of chips and a copy of the , then priced at 6d (2.5p).Are we much better off than 50 years ago?  Money searched prices of goods in 1969 and compared them with today. This shows that in real terms, food, clothes, electrical goods and holidays have collapsed in price and we can afford much more. But there has been a vast relative increase in the price of housing.What is extraordinary about the wages data from the late 1960s is the huge gap between men and women. The ONS New Earnings Survey unfortunately gives no figures for 1969, but for 1970 it shows that the average full-time male worker was paid £30 a week, while a female full-time worker earned just £16.30. Annually, that worked out at £1,560 for men, which is equal to £24,050 today, but only £847.60 for women, equal to £13,068 today.The figures suggest that real pay for the average male has risen by about a third over the last 50 years, but for women it has doubled. These figures, though, need to be taken with a large pinch of salt: they are averages, not the median figure, and reflect gross earnings rather than take-home pay after tax.A look through the ’s classified job adverts on the day the 50p was launched gives a snapshot of what real jobs paid. The Open University, which had just been established, was hiring professors at £3,780 a year (equal to £62,532 today), lecturers on a range of £1,240 to £2,850 (£20,153-£47,147), and secretaries on £756-£1,068 (£12,506-£17,668).The Open University is still hiring – and its adverts suggest that real pay for academics has barely edged ahead in 50 years. It currently has an advert for a professor of economics on a range of £67,700-£75,800, while it pays lecturers £33,000 to £49,000. But the secretary job pays lots more in today’s money, with the OU advertising a role at £23,000 to £26,000.Rampant sexism was a staple for job adverts in 1969, even in the . On that day, we carried an advert for a personnel officer at a new Courtaulds textile factory in Skelmersdale. The ad specified it had to be a man because Courtaulds was expanding its all-male labour force from 400 men to 1,200 men.In real terms, house prices in 1969 were just a third of their level today. The average house sold for £4,312 – equal to £71,333 in today’s money, which would not even buy you a garage in north-west London.One reason house prices were lower was that we all had less free money to spend after buying food. Chicken was about three times the price we pay today, while bread, eggs, coffee and sugar were about double the prices in supermarkets today.But comparing like with like is made tough by the change in weights and measures since 1969, as Britain went metric in the 1970s.What we are eating has also changed. While beef brisket, luncheon meat, dried prunes and corned beef appear in the ONS data for 1969, it’s not until 1996 that prices of avocado and grapes were collected. And instant coffee appears to have been a thoroughly modern new thing in 1969, having appeared in the ONS data for the first time a year earlier.Clothes have also dramatically fallen in price in real terms since 1969. We were unable to obtain like-for-like prices of goods from then, but the fashion page of the  that day gives an indication. We featured a black-and-white wool coat at £34 in Debenhams – equal to £562 today – and a men’s sheepskin coat at 38 guineas, equal to £662 today. Of the 670 coats in Debenhams’ online store today, the most expensive is £349. of 14 October 1969 carried a story in the business pages on a major breakthrough for Granada Rentals – it would offer a colour TV for a rent of just £1 a week. That’s equal to £865 a year in today’s money, but all you got was one channel in colour (BBC2) while the other two channels, BBC1 and ITV, still broadcast in black and white.Renting, even at those prices, was the only option for most people because colour TV sets cost astronomical prices. Our story said that a 19-inch set cost 199 guineas – nearly £4,000 in today’s money – at Currys, and Dennis Curry was reporting that sales had been “rather restrained”. The Granada Rentals deal was for an 11-inch TV set.Not that there was a lot to watch in colour. Broadcasting on BBC2 began at 7pm that evening, with rugby league coverage of Hull v Wigan the primetime offering.Only half of Britain’s homes owned a refrigerator in 1969, dishwashers were almost unheard of, and microwaves were in only a tiny number of homes. And without the likes of Ikea, home furnishings cost far more in real terms then than they do today.If you fancy going to see Fiddler on the Roof, now on at London’s Playhouse theatre, seat prices for a typical October matinee range from £20 to £145. Back in 1969, an advert in the  showed that Fiddler on the Roof was also playing, but at Her Majesty’s theatre. And the prices? There was a special offer of Wednesday matinees at 5s to 25s – or 25p to £1.25. Adjusting for inflation, that means seats were going for just £4 to a top price of £20. West End theatre appears to have quadrupled in price in real terms since the 1960s.In Oxford, the Sadler’s Wells opera was on tour, charging from 6 to 226 (30p to £1.12) to see Madam Butterfly at the Playhouse. That’s equal to £4.80 to £18.50 today. Currently Macbeth is booking at the Playhouse, priced at £10 to £30, so real prices appear to have doubled.In the pubs, we found Guinness at 19d (9p), and mild and bitter at 10p. Adjusted for today, beer prices have doubled in real terms. Mateus Rosé was the most popular wine in the world then: the Queen drank it, and Jimi Hendrix was photographed swigging it out of the bottle.

But it’s not the first version of the coin minted in 1969.The Royal Mint puts 120m new 50p coins into circulation on 14 October 1969, which at the time was the biggest ever issue of a new coin – giving it almost zero rarity value.On eBay, 1969 50p coins can be bought for as little as 75p. Given that 50 years ago the 50p coin had the buying power of £8 today, it has been a pretty poor investment.The 50p coin to watch out for is the more recent 2009 issue that carries a picture of Kew Gardens on the reverse. Just 210,000 of the coins were minted to mark the 250th anniversary of the Royal Botanic Gardens, compared with 19.9m Peter Rabbit 50p coins last year.According to coin dealers, the Kew Gardens 50p coins can fetch £70-£80. But, beware, there are two types – the “circulated” one is much rarer than the shinier “uncirculated” coins, which only pick up about £10-£20 on eBay.Keep an eye out for the 50p coins issued to celebrate the London Olympics in 2012. Dominic Chorney at coin dealers Baldwin’s says some are worth £3-£4, depending on the sport featured.Chorney adds that despite the move towards a cashless society – the Royal Mint did not produce any 1p or 2p coins last year, neither did it make any new £2 coins – coin collecting remains popular, with record prices at auction for the rarest items.In January this year, a five guinea “Vigo”’ coin minted in 1703 fetched the highest price ever paid for a British coin. It sold at Baldwin’s auction in New York for $1.08m (£876,000)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/513cf56bb469051222e92799fde6158c27f4a4dd/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=426c794c4244b6c1055502b3b2a4adb4","title":"its all gone how hurricane dorian devastated the bahamas podcast","story":"Oliver Laughland tells Rachel Humphrys about the destruction he witnessed in the Bahamas in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian.

That includes an additional £2.6bn next year, £4.8bn the year after that and £7.1bn in 2022-23. When you add all three together, you get £14.5bn, but that’s not normally how we talk about spending increases.”Cuffe concluded: “Describing this as a £14bn increase would make the government seem more generous than it is in fact being.”Full Fact, the fact-checking organisation that first wrote about the ads, said about 200,000-500,000 impressions of different versions of the ads had been displayed on Facebook. The ads appear to have been deactivated today.“If you were looking at the ad the Conservative party posted, you would be forgiven for thinking that the BBC headline actually read ‘£14 billion pound cash boost for schools’,” Full Fact stated.Some versions of the ad carried photos of Johnson and linked directly to the Conservative party website, with the headline: “We’re giving a £14 billion cash boost to schools across the UK.”Another version of the ad began: “Tell this news to a friend. We’re giving schools a record £14bn, levelling up per pupil funding across the country.”In his speech confirming the additional spending, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, told parliament: “Today we are delivering on our pledge to increase school spending by £7.1 billion by 2022-23.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10985c717cb344c2f1a1e235bf7ea70d1b3e7e9d/1123_146_4277_2566/master/4277.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ea5ca15735a77a8e663ac05a7e1ce33","title":"alaric bamping brexit party my far left ex boyfriend harriet sherwood","story":"Alaric Bamping was a student SWP firebrand – now he’s standing for the Brexit party. Forty years on, his ex – now a  and Observer writer – asks him what happenedForty years ago, in the autumn of 1979, I was 20 years old and a new graduate from the Polytechnic of Central London (PCL). I was active in the Anti-Nazi League and the Socialist Workers party, joining demonstrations and picket lines and attending earnest meetings in dingy pubs. I’d just started my first job as a trainee journalist. I was living with my boyfriend on the notorious North Peckham estate in south London.The boyfriend was also a member of the SWP and a dominant figure in PCL’s student union, first as the editor of the student paper, and then – twice – as president. Alaric Bamping had a reputation as a leftwing firebrand, leading sit-ins and protests and conducting long, fierce arguments with anyone who disagreed with him.So how the hell, 40 years on, has he ended up as a parliamentary candidate for the Brexit party?Nearly everyone shifts over the years: I ceased parroting ultra-left rhetoric in the early 1980s, and I’m more inclined to gentle reform than revolution these days. But Brexit and the fracturing of traditional tribes and loyalties has exposed and exacerbated our political journeys, sometimes causing acrimonious or painful rifts within families and testing friendships to destruction.Another friend from my student days alerted me to Alaric’s news. “What happened to swing him from the far left in PCL days to far right now?” he asked in a text. It’s a good question I went to find out.Alaric and I parted in early 1982 neither of us could recall the exact date or circumstances. Last week, at the kitchen table of the north London house he shares with his wife, Julia Hobsbawm, the daughter of the acclaimed Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, we first caught up on the personal stuff.The 1980s and 1990s were “all a bit messy”, he said. For a while, he maintained two simultaneous relationships, producing two children with one partner, before finally settling down with Julia – also a former PCL student – with whom he had three more children. Throughout, he ran “a couple of businesses” – antiquarian books and student property rentals – but mainly shouldered responsibility for childcare while his partners pursued their careers.In 1985, five years after he “fell out” with the SWP, he joined the Labour party and became a constituency political officer in east London. It didn’t last he “drifted away” a few years later.By 1997, he was back with Julia, whose PR company Hobsbawm Macaulay Communications was then at the heart of the New Labour project. She founded the company with her old school friend, Sarah Macaulay, who married Gordon Brown in 2000. In Alaric and Julia’s downstairs loo, along with a photograph of Brown and another of Julia receiving an OBE at Buckingham Palace a few years ago, hangs a framed graphic from the  in May 1997. Headlined The In-crowd, it shows the “intricate amalgam of friends and advisers of Tony Blair”. Julia Hobsbawm and Sarah Macaulay are at the centre of the web.The old school friends have long since fallen out. “I didn’t help,” said Alaric. “I avoided Gordon Brown like the plague. I was around them, but I was considered awkward squad. I didn’t really like the Blairites at all, they didn’t appeal to me. I was on the edge of the Stop The War campaign, but not to a significant degree.” There must have been some uncomfortable dinner parties.Alaric stayed away from political party membership until David Cameron was elected leader of the Conservatives in 2005. “I quite liked Cameron.” He joined the party. Why? “I don’t know. Because I’m unorthodox? I used to describe myself as a Tory Trot. I just thought Labour was irredeemably awful. And I always got on with Tories – they’re able to think for themselves, whereas in Labour just follow the line. But I was never active.”When the MPs’ expenses scandal erupted in 2009, Alaric left party politics again. “I thought, Christ, these people – all of them – are awful. It was back to stasis.”But three years ago, the issue of Europe focused his mind. “For most of my life, I’ve tried to avoid single-issue politics. You get tunnel vision. But I didn’t like the European Commission behaving like a nation state in its own right. There was no ambiguity in my mind that we should leave, and leave on World Trade rules.”He placed several bets on Leave winning the referendum. “On the morning, the bookies were offering 7-1 against. I couldn’t believe my luck.” He wagered some more money before heading to the Groucho Club for a referendum party, where there were “probably four Leavers among about 200 Remainers”. How did he feel when the result came through? “Vindicated.” And rich? “Richer than I had been in the morning.” He wouldn’t say how much he won.A brief ersion along his political road came the following year when Jeremy Corbyn faced a challenge to his leadership by mainstream members of the parliamentary Labour party. Alaric rejoined the party in order to back Corbyn in the one-member one-vote contest. “I’m not really a Corbynista – I don’t like all that old statist stuff – but I’m interested in anything that challenges conventional thinking and frees up people’s minds.”The latest, perhaps final, stop on the road came this summer. Claire Fox, an ex-Revolutionary Communist party libertarian and a friend of Alaric and Julia’s, had won a seat as an MEP for the Brexit party. “I suddenly realised that the nascent Brexit party wasn’t Ukip. And I thought opportunities like this, to change the course of politics, don’t turn up very often. Who wouldn’t want to be a part of it? So I filled in my application form.”Did he have a copy of the form? “Yes, but I’m not going to show it to you. It’s a long form, asking things like what experience do you bring?” What did he write? “Forty years of campaigning, on and off. A good strategist.” Application successful, he was interviewed by a panel of three. “They put me through the mangle. Then I was made a candidate, 20 days after I joined the party.”In his Twitter video pitch to the people of Dartford, whose MP he hopes to become in the coming months, he says he views the European Commission as a “slightly dangerous body in that it behaves like a state in its own right”. His Anti-Nazi League activism gets a mention, but not the SWP.The Brexit party, he says in the video, is “a erse and interesting party of people who don’t feel bound to follow the old rules about how we think about the issues of the day. We are free thinkers, prepared to tackle difficult issues without being shackled to the old means of doing it.”I asked him about the party’s policies, beyond a hard, no-deal Brexit. There weren’t any yet, but “it’s all up for grabs”, he said. In an email after we met, he mentioned tackling regional imbalances, scrapping HS2, putting wifi on public transport, and zero interest on student loans. He favours controlled immigration, with fairer access to Commonwealth citizens, and a “transparent” tax system.At this point in political history, he added, the impetus was with “disruptive, insurgent, grassroots-led politics like the Brexit party … However unpalatable this may be to the liberal left, the Brexit party has real political bite.”He was “bothered” by my suggestion that his latest incarnation was a game for him, a new guise for a political maverick. “True, I enjoy being disruptive but no one joining the Brexit party or arguing to leave the EU can be under any possible illusions as to the level of hostility bordering on violence that it entails.” He, a Jew, had received emails accusing him of becoming “a fucking fascist”.Julia, he said, was “stoic” about his new political incarnation. “She is a Remainer, albeit a leave-means-leave kind. But she is fair and loyal.” Had they argued about it? “No. We discussed it. The question is how many of our friends will disown us.” How many will? “There have been a few.” What would his late father-in-law, Eric Hobsbawm, think? “I don’t think Eric would have been surprised by the Brexit party as he had spent a good portion of his life studying insurgent movements. He might even have been mildly amused that he had one right there at the breakfast table.” And his children? “They don’t express much opinion about it. I don’t tell them what to think.”Unlike me, he “looked back fondly” at his SWP days. “I personally feel as radical as I ever did. I’m not less radical, I’ve just changed direction. I don’t think I’ve changed very much over the past 40 years.”After three hours of conversation, this was one thing we could agree on: Alaric always relished being on the outside. He stayed in student politics for so long because he “enjoyed being a big fish in a small pond”. Perhaps the Brexit party gives him the same opportunity. But, whatever his intentions or motives, he is part of a movement that relies on nationalism and rightwing populism, and dismisses liberal values of tolerance and inclusivity. Forty years ago, I admired his provocative nonconformism now it leaves me bemused and despondent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6915607010845dc01fe98d6a7322b77150252211/0_38_3489_2093/master/3489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaaa34fcaac52bea5e9035558effd0ec","title":"lib dems election victory cancel brexit ed davey","story":"Deputy leader says general election victory is much more likely than it has been in the pastEd Davey, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, has defended his party’s proposal to cancel Brexit if it wins a majority in a general election, saying the party would have a democratic mandate to do so without another referendum.On the opening day of the Lib Dems’ autumn conference Bournemouth, Davey said a general election victory for his party was much more likely than it had been in the past. Such a victory would be a clear mandate to remain the the EU, he said.While he said it would be preferable to have a rerun of the referendum right away, Davey said the UK’s other main parties “won’t give us that democratic opportunity”.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Be clear, we are saying we would prefer a referendum because then that’s as clear as you could possibly be. But if we just said in the general election: ‘Well, we will have a referendum,’ that would be asking people to vote twice.“It would be asking for this to go on for so long, and people are fed up. They want to get on with things like investing in our health service, our schools, tackling the climate emergency – things the Liberal Democrats want to do – and they want to therefore have finality, and we would offer that.”Denying that his party’s position simply made them the “mirror image” of no-deal Brexiters, Davey insisted that such a position would allow the Lib Dems to tackle what he said were the causes of the Brexit vote, such as inequality and left-behind communities. “While we have got this nightmare going on in parliament we can’t deal with those problems,” he said.On Friday, Jo Swinson, the leader of the Lib Dems, said she would not support a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour government. But Davey said that in the event of a hung parliament his party would be willing to back Labour’s call for a second referendum, or any other policies that match those in a Lib Dem manifesto.If Lib Dem members back the leadership’s move, revoking article 50 would be written into the party’s next election manifesto. Swinson is expected to take questions from conference delegates on Sunday, after a speech by her predecessor, Sir Vince Cable. Swinson’s main speech will be on Tuesday.The recent reappearance on the campaign trail of a peer accused of sexual harassment has caused controversy.Bridget Harris, a former leading party aide who worked for Nick Clegg, accused the Lib Dems of ignoring women’s safety after Chris Rennard was allowed to campaign in the recent Brecon and Radnorshire byelection.Harris, one of four women who accused Rennard of sexual harassment in 2013, told the Times: “I can’t believe the Lib Dems are prepared to set aside the safety of women and the sense of confidence that women have in their political system for the sake of a guy who is prepared to go canvassing for them in a byelection.”A report found that Swinson and other senior Lib Dems had erred in handling the allegations informally. A 2014 inquiry by Alistair Webster QC found evidence that Rennard had violated the “personal space and autonomy” of several female activists. Rennard has always denied the allegations.The recent defection from the Conservatives of Philip Lee, who abstained in the vote on equal marriage and argued that immigrants should show they do not have HIV or hepatitis B before being allowed into the UK, has caused a separate row, with the head of the Lib Dems’ LGBT group quitting in protest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8214d00816b81dfd309537265840fd9786e9286/117_382_2921_1752/master/2921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d3c53dc60820579beffbc48f3998852","title":"lib dems set out radical agenda for tackling climate emergency","story":"Exclusive: Citizens’ assemblies and a Green Investment Bank among key planks of election bidCitizens’ assemblies will decide what action should be taken on the climate crisis, the Treasury’s ability to stymie green measures will be neutralised and the Green Investment Bank will be revived under proposals set to be key planks of the Liberal Democrats’ general election bid.Along with sweeping reform of Whitehall, including bringing back a department of climate change, local government would be given new powers to cut emissions, there would be a moratorium on airport expansion and an end to fracking, and the UK would achieve net-zero carbon status by 2045 – five years sooner than the current government goal.“Moving to net-zero is a complete game-changer,” Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem spokesperson for the environment and climate change, told the . “The whole of government and society need to understand the need to get to net-zero – everything we do needs to be seen in terms of that target.”Under the proposals to be presented to the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth this weekend, a new minister, who will attend cabinet, would be appointed chief secretary to the Treasury and oversee policy across departments to ensure it meets the zero-carbon pledge.To gain public support for urgent action on emissions, the Lib Dems would convene citizens’ assemblies across the country to debate new measures. These would include ways to ensure a massive expansion of electric vehicles and better public transport, and how to encourage new technology such as heating homes with hydrogen instead of gas. Councils would also be given greater powers over planning, for instance to promote electric vehicles, cycling and walking.“Citizens’ assemblies would not replace politicians’ decision-making, but would inform the options,” said Hobhouse. “We need decisive action – the government is not doing anything, they are dithering.”The Green Investment Bank, created under the coalition government, was sold off under George Osborne. Under a Lib Dem government, a replacement would be set up with public money, and have the powers to borrow money from the private sector.Hobhouse said Brexit was getting in the way of tackling the climate emergency: “Brexit means having less money, and it is very counterproductive. We need international cooperation – climate change is a global problem.”The Lib Dems would end the sale of diesel and petrol cars by 2030 – 10 years sooner than the Conservatives – and stop fracking. There would also be more support for onshore wind and solar, which Hobhouse said the Conservatives had “stopped in their tracks” by drastically changing incentive schemes and planning laws.Green campaigning groups, keen that the climate crisis should not be overshadowed by Brexit as a general election looms, welcomed the Lib Dems’ focus. “Our country may be ided over Brexit, but it is not ided over the need for action on the nature and climate emergency – polling is consistently showing that concern over climate is at an all-time high and a large majority support urgent action,” said Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate change at WWF-UK. “Now we need the climate and nature crisis prioritised at the highest level of government, and billions in new funding, to deliver on the rhetoric. We must stop things like airport expansion that make meeting net-zero even more difficult.”Jenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “With the government’s net-zero target currently lacking anywhere near enough policy to back it up, we’d like to see all parties thinking about what they’d do to make sure the target is actually reached. It’s no good talking about a net-zero future while pursuing a programme of roadbuilding, airport expansion and fracking.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfd1fab107e1ad17ed62c23ea3091dff29f19bc8/0_1_1459_875/master/1459.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5603c3016b8850b4b289558f44176c96","title":"black hole at centre of our galaxy is getting hungrier say scientists","story":"Scientists say Milky Way’s Sagittarius A* has been more active in recent months Unseeable and inescapable, black holes already rank among the more sinister phenomena out in the cosmos. So it may come as disconcerting news that the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way appears to be growing hungrier.Astronomers monitoring the colossal object, called Sagittarius A*, found that in the past year it appears to have consumed nearby matter at an unprecedented rate.“We have never seen anything like this in the 24 years we have studied the supermassive black hole,” said Andrea Ghez, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a senior author of the research. “It’s usually a pretty quiet, wimpy black hole on a diet. We don’t know what is driving this big feast.”In the latest study, the team analysed more than 13,000 observations of the black hole from 133 nights since 2003, gathered by the Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile. The black hole itself cannot be seen because it acts as a one-way trapdoor even for light. But it is possible to detect radiation blazing from gas and dust just outside the “event horizon” as they are accelerated towards their final fate.The team found that on 13 May the area just outside the black hole’s point of no return was twice as bright as the next brightest observation. They also observed large changes on two other nights this year, with all three of those changes being unprecedented, according to Ghez.The team also used a technique called speckle holography to reanalyse older, fainter observations dating back 24 years, from which they concluded that the level of brightness seen this year was unprecedented in the last quarter of a century.“The big question is whether the black hole is entering a new phase … and the rate of gas falling down the black hole drain has increased for an extended period, or whether we have just seen the fireworks from a few unusual blobs of gas falling in,” said Mark Morris, a professor of physics and astronomy at UCLA and the paper’s co-senior author.One hypothesis is that the feeding frenzy is linked to the closest approach to the black hole of a star called S0-2 during the summer of 2018, and that a large quantity of gas from the star could have reached Sagittarius A* this year.Another possibility involves a bizarre object known as G2, which is most likely a pair of binary stars, which made its closest approach to the black hole in 2014. It is possible the black hole could have stripped off the outer layer of G2, Ghez said, which could help explain the increased brightness just outside the black hole. A third suggestion is that several large asteroids have been drawn into the cosmic sinkhole.The black hole is about 26,000 light years from Earth and poses no danger to our planet. The findings appear in Astrophysical Journal Letters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23cfae1aa5733b8eebcdfe28affe25ddc6c971be/0_0_1745_1047/master/1745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23689f69b71b18ff667733faba534dd0","title":"ancient australia was home to strange marsupial giants scientists find","story":"Researchers are building a picture of palorchestids, which had tapir-like skulls and large scimitar-like clawsThe “strange” anatomy of a family of giant marsupials that roamed eastern Australia and Tasmania for much of the past 25m years has been revealed in a new study.Scientists had already figured out that palorchestids had tapir-like skulls and large “scimitar-like claws”, but little was known about the limbs of one of the “strangest marsupial lineages to have existed”, according to the paper published by a group of Australian researchers.By examining 60 fossil specimens of palorchestids of varying geologic ages, the scientists were able to get an idea of how their legs and arms would have looked, functioned and evolved over time.They found that the palorchestid had “muscular bent forelimbs” with fixed elbows that were “unlike any of their marsupial kin, living or extinct”, the study published in journal PLOS ONE this week said.“We are beginning to build a picture of the palorchestids as they were in life,” it said.Palorchestids were a sister family to the better-known Diprotodontidae and became extinct some time during the Late Pleistocene, probably as a result of human activity and climatic change.But mystery has surrounded the exact make-up of palorchestids because very few fossils have been found.What is known is that they died out before other mega-fauna, said the Monash university researcher Hazel Richards.“The fact that there just aren’t that many of these guys in the fossil record probably tells us something about the way they were distributed,” Richards told  Australia.“We find them all over Australia but the population size was probably quite small. And they were quite sparsely arranged. It’s not like these guys were travelling in herds or in large numbers as has been kind of hypothesised for some of the other megafauna.”The study found that as they evolved, palorchestids grew larger and stranger. While they varied in size, the researchers said they were “bigger than previously thought, with the largest species likely weighing over 1000 kg”.“We used a method where you take the circumference of the bone and that tells you something about how much weight is being borne through each of the four legs,” Richards said.“We came up with a number that was substantially larger than what has been estimated before and puts them some way up there among some of the the largest marsupials that we ever had in Australia.”The fossils were obtained from museums in Australia and London’s Natural History Museum.“What makes them so weird is the kind of combination of features that they have,” Richards said.“They’ve got an extremely long pointed face, really tiny little eyes, protrusible tongue, something maybe something a bit like a giraffe, and extremely muscular four quarters ... and huge claws.“Some of the other large megafauna ... like diprotodon they’re not as muscular proportionately as ... and also their claws are much smaller. So these guys were clearly specialised for doing something with their four limbs.”Their claws would have been made digging difficult, “like trying to dig with a chef’s knife”, while their elbows, which could not “bend or straighten, are “totally unheard of in any other mammal, living or extinct”.Richards said future research would aim to determine why palorchestids came to be how they were.“The plan now is to zero in and conduct some functional, biomechanical analyses to try and understand exactly what they were adapted for,” she said.“What foods are they targeting, why would they have become so different from everything else?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8126aee8f7dffbb6f3f403b33d8aa3bdf3b4beb2/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae1e65d47fd238e00d18b9d2a13c3452","title":"english towns and cities get share of 95m regeneration fund","story":"Sixty-nine areas to benefit from scheme designed to breathe new life into high streetsSixty-nine historic English towns and cities will benefit from a £95m regeneration fund, the government has announced.The funding is intended to “breathe new life” into struggling high streets across the country bytransforming abandoned buildings into shops, houses and community centres.Towns and cities entered bids after the scheme was announced in May, with the Midlands winning the largest share of £21.1m.The government’s future high street fund is providing £52m, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) £40m and the National Lottery Heritage Fund £3m.The announcement comes after it was revealed this week that 16 stores had shut down every day in the first half of 2019, a retail crisis fuelled by an increasing shift to online shopping that has already cost tens of thousands of jobs.Last year the then chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced a £675m fund intend to halting high street decline that has left one in 10 shops in UK town centres lying empty. The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) has since promised an additional £325m to bring the size of the fund to £1bn.The government said funding would attract commercial investment and support wider regeneration in the 69 successful areas.“Our nation’s heritage is one of our great calling cards to the world, attracting millions of visitors to beautiful historic buildings that sit at the heart of our communities,” said the culture secretary, Nicky Morgan.The shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, was critical of the announcement, saying that the fund “pales in comparison” to the £1bn “cultural capital fund” that Labour has committed to.By region, the funding breaks down as follows:Barnsley Hexham Huddersfield Hull Leeds Middlesbrough North Shields Northallerton Scarborough CA Castle Ward Selby town centre Skipton Sowerby Bridge and WakefieldBacup, Rossendale Barrow in Furness Blackpool Burnley Chester Fleetwood Kirkham Lancaster Maryport, Cumbria Ormskirk Prescot Stalybridge Tyldesley, Greater Manchester and Wigan town centreBrierley Hill Buxton Coventry Grantham Hinckley Kettering town centre Leicester Leominster Lincoln Newark-on-Trent Town Centre Oswestry Stoke on Trent and Wednesbury town centreBedford Dunstable Great Yarmouth King’s Lynn Lowestoft North Walsham and SwaffhamChard Cullompton Gloucester Keynsham Midsomer Norton Plymouth Poole Redruth Tewkesbury and Weston-Super-Mare.Chatham Intra Croydon Gosport Harlesden Hastings Newport Ramsgate Reading Ryde Tottenham Tower Hamlets and Woolwich."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6cd4976e8767902d488beb2934de5e3bbbce59b/0_86_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46bcd6b031fad04df270a3df69a1a865","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia fifth test day three live","story":"57th over: England 182-2 (Denly 74, Stokes 54) Siddle replaces Hazlewood, and promptly slips a good one past Denly’s outside edge. Denly responds with a businesslike clip through square leg for four when Siddle drifts onto the pads an eventful over concludes with a sincere edge that lands just short of the ing Paine. Hey Joe, c’mon Joe: 26 more runs.“Agree on Denly at 3: it’s where he was picked to bat in the first place, of course,” says Robert Ellson. “Here’s my first XI for the winter: Burns (c), Sibley, Denly, Root, Pope, Stokes, Buttler (wk), Archer, Leach, Broad, Anderson. Obviously the selectors will stick with Root as captain, but I’d really like our world-class batsman back.”The same. I think I’d swap Pope and Stokes, and probably play Curran ahead of Broad or Anderson in New Zealand, but I certainly wouldn’t misplace my rag on a digital platform if that was the XI for the first Test. 56th over: England 177-2 (Denly 70, Stokes 53) Yeehaw! Stokes whips a full toss from Labuschagne for six to reach another authoritative half-century. He almost falls soon after, though, gloving a nasty delivery just short of Bancroft at short leg. And he survives a run-out chance when Wade’s throw from mid-on whistles past the stumps Stokes would have been gone with a direct hit. England lead by 246.“Whisper it, but Australia look a little like England did in the days before General Fletcher and Colonel Hussain cajoled, coerced and commanded them into a competent and then brilliant team,” says Gary Naylor. “The fielding is scrappy, the decision-making muddled, the bowling uninspired - the game is drifting, which suits England all day long. The crowd are paying handsomely for their seats (and for a beer and bite on the concourse) and they deserve more than what’s been served up in this match. And for that, they should blame the administrators and not the players, who are neither robots nor performing fleas able to jump on demand. The schedule has crushed the spirits of even the fittest and finest and devalues Test cricket.”The schedule has been a borderline disgrace for at least a decade. There have been so many warnings, almost all of them ignored.55th over: England 170-2 (Denly 70, Stokes 46) Denly mistimes a pull off Hazlewood for a single, which makes this his highest Test score, before Stokes cuts crisply for three. Thanks, meanwhile, to Malcolm Barnard for sending this Molesworth picture, as requested by John Starbuck during the lunch break.54th over: England 165-2 (Denly 69, Stokes 42) Stokes is beaten through the gate by a ripper from Labuschagne that just bounces over the stumps. For an occasional spinner, he bowls some cracking deliveries. Denly survives a potential run-out chance later in the over after a poor throw from Wade at mid-on. I think Denly would have made it, even with a direct hit. Wade probably went to the wrong end, because Stokes was struggling as he charged towards the non-striker’s end.53rd over: England 160-2 (Denly 68, Stokes 40) Joe Denly has quietly had a decent series, and deserves to keep his place for the New Zealand tour. I’d love to see him at No3, with Dominic Sibley opening alongside Rory Burns. It’s not quite StraussCookTrott, but they share one vital quality with that 2010-11 top three: the ability and willingness to bat time.52nd over: England 160-2 (Denly 68, Stokes 40) This is now the most productive Test series of Stokes’ career - he’s made 414 runs, three more than in South Africa in 2015-16. He survives another appeal, this time for a bat-pad catch off Labuschagne after missing a reverse sweep. 51st over: England 158-2 (Denly 67, Stokes 39) Hazlewood, on for Marsh, has a big shout for LBW against Stokes turned down. There’s no review, but that looked close. It was slightly hard to appraise, because Stokes was on the walk when the ball hit him on the pad as he flicked across the line. Replays show it was missing off stump. England lead by 227.“Even more respect to that dude Kim Thonger,” says Brian Withington. “I loved Bill \u0026amp Ted’s Seventh Seal homage to Bergman with them playing Twister with Death (I guess in the sequel). Like young Curran wrestling with Steve Smith to avoid the inevitable.”50th over: England 155-2 (Denly 67, Stokes 36) Marnus Labuschagne replaces Nathan Lyon, starting with an eventful over to Joe Denly. He turns a boundary off the pads, checks a drive just wide of the ing Labuschagne and finally mistimes a lofted drive that just clears the leaping Marsh at mid-off before racing away for four. 49th over: England 147-2 (lead by 216 Denly 59, Stokes 36) That’s a nice stroke from Denly, who cuts Marsh for four more. He’s 41 runs away from a maiden Test century, two days after the birth of his second child. Who writes your scripts, Joe?Meanwhile, a quick note on the Cork v Archer discussion from earlier, when I was gently belittled by John Cox. I don’t agree that Archer has had a better debut series. Cork was Man of the Match in both England victories, enabling them to draw 2-2 against a very strong West Indies side. He took a match-winning seven-for on debut at Lord’s and a hat-trick in the first over of the final day at Old Trafford. The averages are a red herring, because that was a much higher-scoring series, and so are the number of wickets taken: Cork may have played five Tests but he only bowled in seven innings (plus five overs as the Trent Bridge Test drifted towards a draw).I wasn’t for one minute suggesting Cork was better than Archer, who might already be the best England bowler I’ve ever seen. But I think we forget the Boys Own impact Cork made in his first year of Test cricket, when he looked a superb, relentless swing bowler with a peculiar pant-splitting appeal. His influence on that series was greater than Archer’s on this, in my opinion, although a second-innings ten-for might change that.48th over: England 141-2 (Denly 54, Stokes 35) In Test cricket, Stokes has batted everywhere from Nos3-11. I wonder where he’ll settle over the next few years. No5 feels about right, ideally with Root at No4 and maybe Pope at No6.47th over: England 140-2 (Denly 54, Stokes 34) Stokes, England’s batsman of the series, moves into the thirties by steering Marsh past backward point for four. In other news, that was a bad non-review from Australia a couple of overs ago, because it looked pretty clear that the worst-case scenario was umpire’s call. Anyway, Denly survived.“I see Aggers is looking forward to Jofra bowling on the hard pitches down under,” says Bill Hargreaves. “On the subject of fast bowlers, one that I’ve heard an enormous amount about - but have failed to find either footage or articles on - is Lillian Thomson. Complete blank on Google. Can anyone fill me in, please?”Yeah, she played alongside Evelyn Waugh back in the day.Thanks Adam, hello everyone. England are pottering towards what should be a matchwinning lead. They are 208 ahead, with plenty of batting to come.46th over: England 135-2 (Denly 54, Stokes 29) Lyon sends down the final over before drinks, Stokes tucking one off his pads, Denly doing the rest. Being the halfway mark of the day, it’s time for me to hand the baton to Rob Smyth, who will see you through to stumps. Bye! 45th over: England 134-2 (Denly 54, Stokes 28) Marsh is back on to dry things up. This isn’t a good sign for Siddle, who has been called upon for just four of the 44 overs sent down so far in this second innings. He’s where he needs to be at Stokes, pushing and missing right away. Marsh is convinced he has Denly leg before to finish but Umpire Erasmus turns it down and Paine doesn’t review. Looked a pretty good shout, too. Technology says it was out! Well, well...44th over: England 133-2 (Denly 54, Stokes 27) Stokes is getting busy now, advancing the lead beyond 200 with a four then a six from consecutive balls. The first came courtesy of a rare Labuschagne misfield but the second was brilliant - a hard, flat sweep. Shot.43rd over: England 122-2 (Denly 54, Stokes 16) After waiting and leaving and waiting and leaving, Stokes picks his moment to drive Hazlewood through cover, adding three. Both then pull singles to finish. A productive over, the lead for the home side is now 191. “Adam,” replies Kim Thonger. “Please do tell the wholly remarkable Brian Withington I’m grateful for his kind words. He’s reminded me that it’s 30 years since Bill \u0026amp Ted’s Excellent Adventure found its way into my VHS recorder, (and I don’t mean Bill Edrich and Ted Dexter, for the avoidance of doubt).”42nd over: England 116-2 (Denly 53, Stokes 12) That’s Lyon’s spell done for the time being, leaving the ground at the end of the over to get his spinning finger looked at again. He split the skin on it at Manchester last week. They were very chatty to Stokes around the bat before he got off strike with a sweep for three. Interesting. 41st over: England 113-2 (Denly 53, Stokes 9) Hazlewood beats Stokes to begin, working across his body. The ball isn’t that old, of course. There’s still enough there for the quicks - there certainly was for Marsh on Thursday. In response, the left-hander leaves the rest in that vicinity, happy taking a single to long leg when on offer.  “How many of my teams can lose in one weekend?” asks Peter McNaughton. “Australia lost to Spain in the basketball and the Lions lost to GWS, Newcastle United are down 2-1 to Liverpool and this English lead is starting to climb. Surely one win from four isn’t too much to ask?” I’m sure all Australian readers will all share your Boomers pain. Many of us in the press box spent the first 15 minutes watching the dramatic finish of that rather than the cricket yesterday. Sigh.40th over: England 112-2 (Denly 53, Stokes 8) Stokes gives the strike back to Denly with a single to long-off, the opener now more watchful against Lyon. He’s getting more turn by the over.“As a wee lad,” writes Philip Sutherland, “I used to watch Surrey from time to time. Heady days: Edrich, Edwards, Mickey Stewart, Roope, Intikarb Alam, Pocock, Long, Arnold, Jackman and Storey (yes, long time ago) spring immediately to mind so always love The Oval Test. Thank you for your commentary.” Thanks for your company. It’s heresy to say this as a Melburnian, but I think this is my favourite Test ground. At least in the semi-finals.39th over: England 111-2 (Denly 53, Stokes 7) That’s a great way for Denly to raise his half-century, clipping Hazlewood through square leg for an attactive boundary. The Oval faithful are standing in applause, acknowledging his fourth Test half-century. Talking to him before this match, the Kent veteran never thought this was going to happen for him as of a couple of seasons ago. A nice story. A tweet from Ian Anderson in reply to John Stabuck at lunch. 38th over: England 105-2 (Denly 47, Stokes 7) Smith has put Stokes down at slip! It was a tough chance, flying off the bat from the back foot. He got his hands there in time but it was in and out. Earlier in the over, the left-hander took it to the spinner as Denly did to begin the day, coming down and smacking him over his head for four. 37th over: England 101-2 (Denly 47, Stokes 3) The England 100 is up, Denly pushing Cummins into the legside for one. That makes the lead 169 - nice and healthy. Stokes breaks with the trend of late and takes on a bouncer later in the over, nearly picking out deep backward square. Back to Plan A here, I reckon, fellas. 35th over: England 98-2 (Denly 45, Stokes 2) They are working to a plan with Cummins, seeing him out of the attack without any risks, surely mindful of the work he has in his legs of late. Denly keeps the strike, helping a short ball on its way for a single. More on Wade on Richard McConnell. “Massive fan of Wade exuding that trademark “Elite Honesty” and mouthing off. Off the back of a very middling series, he demonstrates a streak of self-confidence that most folk would die for.” Some StokesWarner chat at the lunch break as well, so twitter tells me. I’m sure we’ll read more about that by the close. David Gower had a bit of a hot-mic moment too, I’m told. All the fun of the fair.34th over: England 97-2 (Denly 44, Stokes 2) I’m going to mozz him here, but I reckon this is the day Denly gets to 100. His 44th of those comes through a clip to midwicket, handling Lyon really well. “Thought for day,” from Nicholas Walmsley. “Maybe Wade owes his selection in large part to his facial hair? There was always a strong correlation between hirsute Aussies and the position of Yapper-in-Chief: Lillee, Marsh, Hughes, Border, Boon … although it started to tail off in the late 90s. Johnson, of course, had a spectacular muzzie, but this current Aussie crew (Wade aside) are a disturbingly clean-shaven bunch. They need another Ocker or two, then they’ll be world beaters.” Decent theory - correlationcausation, I wonder? They still grow it when visiting the subcontinent an Australians-on-tour tradition.33rd over: England 96-2 (Denly 43, Stokes 2) Cummins is trying to tempt Stokes from over the wicket but the left-hander wants nothing of it, a satisfied observer shouldering arms. For now, at least.“I read an article written by your colleague Emma John on the retirement of David Gower from the Sky commentary team,” reports Nick Bimson. “Tucked away in this article was a delicious paragraph on the excellency of Nasser Hussain’s and Mike Atherton’s analytic skills and a consequent call for the pair to be awarded a spin-off crime show. Inspired by this prospect, my friend and I began generating potential titles for an appropriately pulpy serial blending morally ambiguous hardboiled machismo with cerebral continental flair think Double Indemnity with generous dollops of Hercule Poirot. The current fruits of our creative partnership include:Athers and Nass: Trial by SpinAthers and Nass: Seams like MurderAthers and Nass: Outside the Line of EnquiryAthers and Nass: Death of an Innings.”32nd over: England 96-2 (Denly 43, Stokes 2) Lyon it is from the end where he picked up Root before lunch. Stokes watches the first few carefully before pushing to cover for one. It was Denly who went after him from the outset this morning and he’s of that mind again, coming down but failing to make good contact this time. He gets a couple down the ground but wasn’t in complete control. Still, it remains a good plan to mess with the tweaker’s confidence. 31st over: England 93-2 (Denly 41, Stokes 1) Top bowling Cummins right away to start the session, punctuated by a perfect leg-cutter to Denly, beating him a treat outside his off-stump. But the opener has shown through this series that he doesn’t lose his concentration after copping a good one, leaning on a lovely cover drive to finish the over.The players are back on the field. Stokes is at the business end. He’ll be facing Pat Cummins from the Pavilion End. Walking past the team as they set up, Ricky Ponting was offering some thoughts. If I’m reading the body language correctly, I think Smith was suggesting to him that it’ll be Lyon on next from the Vauxhall End. PLAY! “Ola Adam.” Hello, Geoff Wignall. “Australia need to be careful here - unless they allow England a lead of around 400, Smith’s unlikely to have the opportunity for taking Bradman’s record whilst winning this match.” I’ll take the 905. There are a lot of numbers still left. “Please pass on my very best to the excellent Kim Thonger,” relays Brian Withington. “I feel almost guilty for hoping that Ravi \u0026amp co can preserve the long accustomed (and clearly comfortable) Somerset vibe at Taunton in two weeks time. Almost.”I wonder if Pete Siddle will be available? Some shirt numerology from Smylers. “The least-droppable members of the England team are probably Joe Root, Jofra Archer, Ben Stokes, and Jack Leach — whose shirt numbers are 66, 22, 55, and 77. So maybe any new player getting a call-up for the next tour would fare best by picking one of the remaining repeating-digit squad numbers? Perhaps 33, which has worked out pretty well for Marnus Labuschagne.”In Australia, we have a cabinet minister who added an ‘S’ to her name because of numerology. You couldn’t make it up. More along those very good lines from Paul Jarvis: “G’day Adam from misty Scotland. Anyone notice when Stokes came in just now that his runs scored were 3526 and his average was... 35.26? It jus goes to show... something.”“Just wondering what a realistic run chase would be for Australia?” asks Martin Gillam. The question probably becomes do they have someone who can take it deep with Smith. No more than 300. “Can I be the first (and hopefully only) one to comment that nasty people might say that Denly’s being hit where it hurts might be thought of as appropriate in view of the birth of his second child - overpopulation and all that,” jokes Rob Lewis. “Father of four.”“The prospect of a ‘punchy’ 2nd innings ton from Warner might indeed be ‘tasty to write about’, demonstrating your admirable journalistic bent before any patriotic considerations,” says Brian Withington. Why, thank you. “However, from a Brexit-riddled English supporter’s perspective it could well leave me plucking out my eyes and thus missing the arrival of the other three horsemen of the apocalypse.” Nice imagery. Don’t worry, it won’t happen.“Seeing Pete Salmon use the term Old Skool immediately evoked the cartoon of Molesworth, in typically scruffy cricket gear, standing in the outfield and musing ‘and it could all be ended in a minute’ while the ball is about to descend on his head,” according to John Starbuck. “I can’t find the drawing online but someone else might be able to, though any fule know that.”A pretty good session for England. It would have been a very good one had Root made it through to the interval but their lead is building solidly and the Australian attack are having to work hard in superb batting conditions. Can they do it again and punish Australia with a day in the dirt? We’ll find out after lunch. I’ll be back in about 15 minutes to race through some more emails. Drop me a line. 30th over: England 88-2 (Denly 37, Stokes o) Stokes gets off strike from the first ball of Lyon’s over via a leg bye behind square. The spinner stays around the wicket to Denly, playing it out defensively, all on the front foot. He’s earned his sandwich. LUNCH! As they leave the field, Paine puts his arm around Erasmus. They were trying to sneak the extra over in but didn’t make it before 1pm. 29th over: England 87-2 (Denly 37, Stokes o) Three maidens on the bounce for Australia, something they have struggled to achieve in this Test with the exception of when Marsh and Cummins were operating together after tea on day one, prompting that run of wickets. Marsh, now moved to the pavilion end, has started well, and Denly has nearly got himself through to lunch. One to come.“Being the Oval and being the Ashes, who will reprise the roles of Brett Lee and Kevin Pietersen from 2005?” asks Boris Starling... a tad optimistically, I’d suggest! “It’s still one of the most astonishing innings I’ve ever seen, particularly that passage of play with Lee bowling faster and faster and Pietersen hitting him harder and harder - such ridiculous hand speed with the bat, and his eyes so focussed it was as though he were in a trance.” He wants Cummins v Stokes, which will be coming up after this lunch break. 28th over: England 87-2 (Denly 37, Stokes o) That’s big for Lyon. Yes, he already had a wicket today but it wasn’t a pretty one. This was, though. Picking up the England captain ten minutes before lunch, no less. That feels good. Good captaincy from Paine too, moving him to the Vauxhall End, where he hadn’t yet bowled from in the Test.Romeo is very cross that commentators are saying that Labuachagne has been ‘discovered’ in this series despite playing for Australia last summer and making lots of runs for Glamorgan. “Whether he’s South African or Australian is irrelevant because he’s actually Welsh. He’s been legally adopted and his surname is now Llabwschagne.”Lyon has two! Root played for turn that wasn’t there, edging the overspinner to Smith at slip who makes no mistake.27th over: England 87-1 (Denly 37, Root 21) Siddle gets through a dry maiden to Denly. That’s what they want from him. 26th over: England 87-1 (Denly 37, Root 21) Marsh doesn’t get it going quite so much this time around, the set pair exchanging singles square of the wicket before the captain ends the over with a solid push through cover for two. They’ll get four more in before lunch.“I’m looking at my hands here and I don’t see how you can even get seven stitches in the webbing between two of your fingers,” Ben Mimmack observes. “Are Marcus Harris’ hands shaped like a frog’s foot or something? Maybe that’s why I never made it as a top level cricketer.” Rule of thumb (so to speak): ALL cricketers have huge hands. Even the small ones. That’s all I’ve got for you on this topic. 25th over: England 83-1 (Denly 36, Root 18) Siddle is back now too, the CumminsHazlewood duo rested before the interval. Denly gets a bit of width from the first change and uses it well, steering behind point for four. It’s a pretty good return to the crease though, twice finding the inside edge with probing deliveries then, you guessed it, whacking the opener in the box again. It was well timed as Denly’s earlier blow there had prompted a full montage of sorts on Sky of the times Root has found it funny when others have suffered. Naturally, it is followed by the David Lloyd incident. “Straight in the nads!” he says. Okay - I laughed. I can’t help it. “Can I just point out to Brian Withington that nobody can truly understand REAL pessimism until they’ve supported Somerset CCC for a few decades,” notes Kim Thonger. “Every time we’ve had a sniff of the county championship it’s been whisked away from under our noses. It’s not a glass half empty feeling, it’s an empty glass vaporised in a nuclear conflagration feeling.” This time, though?24th over: England 79-1 (Denly 32, Root 18) Root’s best shot so far this morning, taking Mitch Marsh’s second ball through square leg for a beautifully timed boundary. Australia’s new swing ace gets the ball hooping later in the over though, beating the outside edge by a long way. He’s asking questions with the last ball too, Root keeping one out going the other way off the seam. An encouraging start.23rd over: England 75-1 (Denly 32, Root 14) They like the Cummins v Root contest but the England captain keeps getting off strike early in the over against him. He gets another ball to jag back at the groin of Denly as he did in his previous, this time clipping the inside edge and running down to the rope. Lucky for the opener on two fronts.22nd over: England 70-1 (Denly 28, Root 13) After the delay for Denly to compose himself, Root edges the first ball from Hazlewood to slip. It’s a genuine edge - his hands weren’t soft - it just doesn’t carry. Back on strike, Denly defends Hazlewood with confidence.“Is that why Wade’s in the side then?” asks David Seats. “The chirp?” I didn’t see the incident in question after the drinks break when racing back from the gents, but I assume he was called up by the umps for being a naughty boy again? A bit of that last night, too.21st over: England 67-1 (Denly 28, Root 10) Oooh, another delivery into the box. Have more helmets or boxes been hit in this series? A lot of both, that’s for sure. Denly is down for a long time too, the medical staff coming out to keep him company. He had handled the Cummins over well to that point, defending solidly then pushing Australia’s numero uno through cover for a couple. Count ‘em. “Quick word about the keeping of Paine this series,” begins Pete Salmon. “Been a real pleasure to watch an Old Skool keeper ply his trade. Athletic takes done with minimum fuss, and that catch – stayed low, took easily. A quiet masterclass.”I didn’t give enough credit there, did I? He’s very, very good.

They’ve been hardest hit Holidaymakers queuing at immigration at the Bahamas’ Nassau airport are still serenaded by three pink-shirted men playing jovial music. They are still sunbathing on the beaches and still swimming in the sea. It is as if nothing has changed in paradise.Yet 40 minutes away by plane, on the Abaco Islands, heaven turns to hell. The Mudd, a shantytown that was home to the Bahamas’ biggest Haitian immigrant community, has been obliterated by Hurricane Dorian as if by a massive bomb.On Thursday a bare, crooked tree reminiscent of a desert wasteland was one of the few things still standing. Every dwelling had been destroyed. Cars were overturned. The ground was a wasteland strewn with blankets, clothes, fridges, shoes, rusty nails, splintered plywood, toilets and toothbrushes. The size of several football pitches, the Mudd was peopleless no one knows how many died here and how many evacuated.Natural disasters often expose the gap between the haves and have nots and Dorian was no different. While the Bahamas has a reputation as one of the most desirable tourist destinations on earth, its luxury hotels and homes depend on a life support system of fishermen, hotel workers and laborers. Once again, it is the poorest who have been hardest hit when catastrophe strikes.“We’ve brought this on ourselves,” was one opinion conveyed anonymously to the . “It’s all fine when you’re living in paradise and a Haitian comes and mows your lawn. We’ve just created our own structure and there hasn’t been any attempt to integrate.”The Mudd was built by thousands of Haitian immigrants over decades in Marsh Harbour on Abaco. But it was wiped out in hours, its flimsy wooden structures standing little chance against the wrath of Dorian. American emergency workers have found five bodies in the debris and expect more to come.Others fled and are unaccounted for. Some have evacuated by boat to Nassau. Some sought refuge in places such as the pink-walled New Haitian Mission Baptist church. At one point 210 Haitians gathered on its bare concrete floor, without electricity or running water. Now there are 45, including two children.Charles Ilfrenord, its pastor, who moved from Haiti 35 years ago but still has family there, said: “Plenty of people died in the Mudd. I think more than 1,000.”Jean Claude Timothy, 41, a builder and electrician who lived next to the Mudd, recalled helping his wife and children into the attic of their house as water rose 25ft high. “A trailer knocked the roof right off. I had to swim to get a boat to put my family in. We pulled it slowly down the road for a half a mile.”The family were temporarily blinded by fumes from a nearby oil and diesel plant, Timothy added, but they found shelter in a government building. Timothy’s wife, 31-year-old Kenya, and their four children were evacuated by a boat that was taking women and children only. Timothy is now sleeping rough in a roofless building and struggling for food. “We’re just waiting for jobs and for something to do,” he said.“Everybody’s been hit, the rich and the poor, but for the rich it’s less severe because they live in better buildings. The people you work for for years don’t send a private plane for you. You worked for them for years but they don’t give you any food, any vacation pay.”Tourism employs about half the Bahamian workforce and accounts for around half GDP. Abaco is renowned for its marinas, golf courses and all-inclusive resorts. Even now, a leaflet at Nassau airport advertises the Abaco Beach Resort, including “a boating paradise unlike any other”. Glen Kelly, its harbour master, told the Washington Post: “I’ll put it as raw as I can. We’ve always depended on Haitian labour, legal or illegal, to maintain this place. Now it’s a question of whether they’ll be back.”Paradise comes at a social, economic and moral cost. The Bahamas has the second highest economic and social inequality in the Caribbean, according to the Latin American Economic Outlook 2019 Report. An editorial in the Nassau  newspaper in 2017 warned: “Economic inequality is killing the Bahamas.” As Hurricane Dorian approached, affluent people were able to get out early whereas the poor had to remain and try to ride it out.Lydia Ruth Hill, 38, a vacation planner and property manager, was one of only seven people who stayed behind in a neighborhood of more than 200. She had no sleep for 48 hours as she searched for missing people in the rubble two of her relatives are still unaccounted for. She is now setting up a recovery command center but is inundated with messages from those who left and are worried about their possessions.“They were just really inconsiderate requests when we were on survival mode here and then people mouthing off at us when we said that we don’t have time to do that. At that point I was still trying to get critical care people off the island.”Nearly two weeks after Dorian made landfall, at least 50 deaths have been reported, more than 1,300 people are missing and an estimated 15,000 are without food or shelter. Many in the underclass lost everything.Earl Arthurs, the operations specialist for the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency, said: “Any disaster, the poor people will be the ones that are punished. A poor person owns a small house and it’s not insured so when the hurricane comes and it’s washed away, that’s it. A rich person owns a nice mansion and it gets totaled but he gets money to build a new one. So that’s a big difference.“Some of these people are living from hand to mouth, weekly pay cheque, so when something like this happens and they cannot work, they will definitely be dependent on government for support.”There are concerns that undocumented Haitian immigrants may be reluctant to seek government aid lest they be penalized and deported. Arthurs said: “In every country, including the United States, people are scared to come out and register during crisis time, because after the crisis is finished they fear that they probably have enough information on them to go and pick them up and deport them.”Paul Taylor, the operations response manager of Team Rubicon UK, an NGO working with partners to coordinate and distribute aid, added: “As ever, there are people who do the work that the rich people don’t want to do and here that’s the Haitian community. There are lot of illegals here as well.“I think the issue now is what happens to people who don’t have any status here, who might be quite concerned about that. You’ve got to evacuate people from the islands – big reconstruction job – but where do those people go?”The government of the Bahamas denies that Haitians will be treated differently."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82c61f4e99a4b242b05d2a2188e23fa2eea04848/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2f1b81d772134fc3eba4d2d72bdd7a6","title":"juan guaido faces questions over links to organised groups","story":"Opposition leader plays down images but analysts say they could prove highly damagingJuan Guaidó, the Venezuelan politician fighting to topple Nicolás Maduro, is facing awkward questions about his relationship with organised crime after the publication of compromising photographs showing him with two Colombian paramilitaries.In an interview on Friday, Guaidó played down the significance of the pictures, in which he posed alongside two members of the Colombian criminal gang the Rastrojos identified as El Brother and El Menor.The photos appear to have been taken on 22 February as Guaidó used an illegal border crossing to sneak across Venezuela’s western border into Colombia to attend a Live Aid-style concert in the town of Cúcuta.“I took hundreds of photos that day,” Guaidó told the Colombian broadcaster Blu Radio. “It was hard to know who was asking for a photo. Misconstruing these photos means playing the Maduro regime’s game.”On Friday Venezuela’s state prosecutor’s office said it would open an investigation into the photos. Analysts said the images had the potential to cause severe harm to Guaidó’s credibility and his nine-month quest to force Maduro from power.The Rastrojos are a drug-trafficking group with paramilitary origins who operate on both sides of the Colombia-Venezuela border. As well as the cocaine trade, they are engaged in illegal mining, kidnapping for ransom and extortion.Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based expert for Crisis Group, said: “I think it is extremely damaging. Regardless of whether this was as innocent as they claim – which is rather hard to believe – or whether there was something more to it, it looks so bad.”Gunson said the photos handed “a huge propaganda victory” to Maduro’s government, which is fending off accusations of ties to leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers.Maduro sought to exploit the scandal on Thursday, claiming the images were definitive evidence of Guaidó’s ties to “paracos, murderers and narco-traffickers”.In a televised speech, Maduro declared: “The connection between Colombian narco-trafficking and the Venezuelan right is right there in the photo. No one can deny it.”Gunson said that whatever the truth, the photos showed “unbelievable naivety” and were an embarrassment to the international coalition backing Guaidó, which includes the US, Colombia, Brazil and the UK.“It could almost not have come at a worse time for Guaidó,” Gunson said, pointing to the Colombian government’s plans to denounce Maduro’s ties to leftist guerrillas at the UN general assembly later this month.The photos were published on Thursday by Wilfredo Cañizales, the director of a human rights group in Cúcuta, where February’s highly politicised concert was held.Speaking to the , Cañizales claimed the Rastrojos had imposed a curfew along the border before Guaidó’s crossing into Colombia “to make sure no locals would take photos of him crossing illegally through the hidden paths”.Cañizales declined to say how he had obtained the photos or why he had decided to publish them but said: “The Rastrojos are paramilitaries. They are the ones in this region who decide who lives and who dies.”Gunson said the photos also posed uncomfortable questions for Guaidó’s backers in the Colombian government and their possible links with paramilitary groups. “There’s a lot of questions that haven’t been answered,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62c84534d56d2e9bed9974674d7bb54e1c83f71a/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b9a77395a452082df6ead360f242bf","title":"judge who convicted geoffrey boycott i stand by my verdict","story":"‘I cannot believe he’s being received by the Queen,’ says French judge The French judge who convicted Geoffrey Boycott of assaulting his girlfriend has criticised the former England cricketer after he was knighted and says she stands by her decision to find him guilty.The move to award Boycott the honour prompted outrage this week from a domestic violence charity. He was convicted in 1998 of assaulting Margaret Moore, who was left with black eyes after he hit her 20 times.Boycott, who has always denied the offence, said he “couldn’t give a toss” about criticism over Theresa May awarding him a knighthood, and cast doubt on the credibility of French justice.But after being tracked down by the  in Alsace, Dominique Haumant, who presided over trial, said she did not believe Boycott’s denial and that his conduct during the court case had been “arrogant” and “deplorable”.“I cannot believe he’s being received by the Queen,” she said. “I’m told she will take a sword and anoint him on each shoulder. Now that I’m really shocked at. He doesn’t deserve it.“As far as French justice is concerned, he has been found guilty of having beaten his partner three times.”The retired judge said: “I remember this case very well and I remember the row about it even after 20 years. I saw all the photos, the evidence, the statements and if I didn’t think he was guilty I wouldn’t have convicted him.” Boycott was fined £5,300 and given a three-month suspended jail sentence, upheld by a second court on appeal. He was also ordered to pay a symbolic one franc in compensation to Moore.The 78-year-old former England captain, who has been commentating for Channel 5 and BBC Radio 5 Live during this summer’s Ashes series, has always denied the charges and claimed Moore was a “woman scorned” exacting her revenge.“Boycott was most definitely not a gentleman,” Haumant said. “He told one of the opposing lawyers to shut up during the hearing. That was extremely vulgar and not something you say during a hearing. I can’t imagine a judge in your country allowing that, and I wouldn’t allow it.”“He claimed it was an accident, but, as I say, if I convicted him it was because I thought he was guilty and I stand by that. He appealed and my judgment was upheld by the appeal court.“It is more than 20 years ago, but I still remember his behaviour in the courtroom. He was arrogant and he had a deplorable attitude throughout the trial.”After he was convicted in the court in Grasse, on the Côte d’Azur, Boycott took a swipe at the French judge, saying he was not entirely surprised to be found guilty “in view of the way the trial was conducted”. He claimed that unlike the UK, the legal system in France rested on the principle of “guilty until proven innocent”.He said he did not care about condemnation of his honour from a leading domestic violence charity. Responding to Adina Claire, the co-acting chief executive of Women’s Aid, who described his knighthood as part of former prime minister Theresa May’s resignation honours list as “extremely disappointing”, Boycott told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Martha Kearney: “I don’t give a toss about her, love.”The French legal system, like the British, is based on the principle that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty. All but the most serious crimes and offences, those carrying a prison sentence of 10 years or more, are tried without a jury.People are not “charged” with a crime or offence in France, they are “put under investigation”. Before the case comes to trial, an investigating magistrate known as a juge d’instruction tells police to collect evidence and takes witness statements to produce a case file to determine whether an offence has been committed.If the magistrate decides there is no charge to answer, the case is classé, or dropped. If the magistrate decides there is a case to answer, the person is sent to trial and the file, available to the lawyers of all interested parties, is presented to the trial judge.There were three hearings in the Moore v Boycott case. He was first convicted of assault in January 1998 by judge Marc Juando at a court in Grasse. He was not present for the hearing and appealed successfully to have the verdict set aside. Haumant presided over a second trial in Grasse in November 1998 that confirmed the verdict of the first. Boycott appealed and a panel of three judges upheld the conviction in May 2000.The November 1998 trial was long and at times chaotic. Boycott was said to have flown 13 witnesses to the south of France at an estimated cost of more than £200,000, but many appeared to have nothing to say directly about the accusations. They included a psychiatrist who had never met Moore but gave his interpretation of her behaviour from television clips and conversations with her former husband.Haumant remembers sitting until the early hours of the morning hearing witnesses, many of them appearing for Boycott, all of whose testimony had to be translated. “It was a long trial, but then there were a lot of witnesses, most of them for the defendant,” she said.The verdict in January had been set aside because Boycott failed to turn up to the brief hearing, explaining he was on tour commentating on Test matches in South Africa.Boycott and Moore were staying at the Hotel du Cap in Antibes in October 1996 when they argued. Moore was reported to have become even more furious when she returned to their hotel room to find Boycott packing for an early flight back to the UK.He claimed she had slipped in the ensuing fracas while throwing his clothing and belongings out of the window.Moore said he had attacked her, holding her to the ground and staring at her with “wild, piercing and manic” eyes as he hit her.In her seven-page written explanation of her verdict, Haumant, who told British journalists covering the trial that her hero was the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, made it clear she was not impressed with Boycott’s behaviour in or out of court.“In the court, the accused didn’t hesitate to interrupt Mrs Moore’s lawyer rudely, tarnishing the image of the perfect gentleman which he brought his old friends and witnesses to testify to,” she wrote at the time. She said the evidence presented to the court “does not support the theory of an accidental fall” and ruled that Moore had been the victim of “purposeful blows”.Boycott accused Moore of blackmailing him to settle for a large sum of money, but she said it was never about cash. She asked for and was awarded the symbolic one franc damages. Boycott, labelled a woman-beater and criminal, found it difficult to shake off the stain on his reputation, even when Moore’s former solicitor Sue Sims-Steward said Moore saw Boycott as a way of solving financial problems and portrayed the victim as a difficult woman who could “turn on the tears at will”.“It’s no surprise to me that he’s been given an honour,” said Haumant. “I remember reading a profile of Theresa May in the French magazine l’Express when she said her great idol was not the Beatles or the Rolling Stones, but Geoffrey Boycott.“On the other hand it is surprising because of what he did,” she said.“I was heavily criticised for my judgment to the point I worried that I’d better not go to the UK because I wouldn’t be safe in the street. I remember an article that made fun of me for not knowing anything about cricket, but why would I?”A spokesman for Boycott did not comment."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4017474.1568398144!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hundreds of obese people waiting more than five years for surgery","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tReport notes there are just over 500 patients awaiting psychological and surgical evaluations for sleeve gastrectomy operations. Photograph: Rui VieiraPA WireHundreds of morbidly obese people are being left waiting more than five years for potentially life-changing surgery, a private medical report compiled for Minister for Health Simon Harris has said.The unpublished document, relating to bariatric services at Galway University Hospital, warns of the dangers of funding shortfalls at a time of rising levels of obesity and related illnesses.By June about 670 obese patients were facing the delays, with numbers rising all the time.The report, submitted to the Minister last month, notes there are just over 500 patients awaiting psychological and surgical evaluations for sleeve gastrectomy operations, with both steps required before a patient can undergo the procedure.“In effect, patients referred for bariatric surgery in Galway remain on a waiting list for surgical and psychological assessment for more than two years,” the report states.“Moreover, 170 patients have been seen by the surgeon and the psychologist ... and have been placed on the waiting list for surgery. At current rates of surgical activity in Galway, they will be waiting in excess of five years.”The 78-page report was written for Mr Harris’s attention by Dr Francis Finucane, consultant endocrinologist at the hospital.In an accompanying letter he expressed concern that “critically important resources that we have sought will not be forthcoming. We simply cannot let this happen.”Sleeve gastrectomy operations remove part of the stomach, reducing food consumption. They are considered a crucial option in tackling chronic obesity, which continues to rise in Ireland.They are carried out publicly at the Galway hospital and St Vincent’s in Dublin, and privately at clinics in Dublin, Cork and Galway.Those who undergo the procedure can lose up to 20 per cent of their body weight within a year. The surgery can also result in the discontinuation of treatment for diabetes, a major illness associated with weight gain.Good procedureA 2016 paper published in the Irish Journal of Medical Science stated that, in a world where obesity rates have “soared”, gastrectomy is “increasingly regarded as a good surgical procedure”.The paper put Irish rates of obesity at 22.9 per cent among men and 22.5 per cent among women.“Despite vigorous efforts, the obesity endemic has continued to rise,” it said, highlighting a correlation in increasing rates of associated illness such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.In a letter to then minister for health Leo Varadkar in 2015, Dr Finucane highlighted a study suggesting €1 billion of annual public expenditure be channelled towards obesity-related treatment alone.Last year an article published by the International Federation for the Surgery of Obesity stated that the current rate of bariatric surgery in Ireland falls short of international ethical standards – fewer than one in 100,000 people, compared with 70 in France and Sweden, and 50 in the US.Despite this the report submitted to Mr Harris is highly critical of funding procedures, with repeated Galway University Hospital appeals “falling on deaf ears” in recent years.“The process for requesting and prioritising these resources is unclear, opaque and convoluted. The allocation of resources nationally is inequitable, arbitrary and lacks transparency,” it said.“There was ‘token’ funding of 15 surgeries through the National Treatment Purchase Fund in 2018, but as we articulated to hospital management at the time, this is wholly inadequate and is symptomatic of systematic de-prioritisation of bariatric services in Galway.”Department responseIn response the Department of Health said obesity is a priority issue for the Minister, particularly improving access to hospital treatment, and he has recently met with HSE officials to discuss it.A recent report by a Royal College of Physicians in Ireland expert group concluded that the costs of failing to do so were “incalculable”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4018465.1568464592!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"green party says noel grealish should come out of hiding","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party TD Catherine Martin: “You just don’t land a punch like that and then go away.”Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin has condemned comments made by Galway TD Noel Grealish on asylum seekers from Africa earlier this week.“The language is appalling, inflammatory and dangerous coming from an elected member of our national parliament,” she said.“The Deputy should come out of hiding.

He and the party’s finance spokesperson Neasa Hourigan also said it would involve a complete rewriting of the National Development Plan.Party leader Eamon Ryan also said the Greens would seek a carbon tax increase of €20 per tonne in the Budget, which is twice the amount that is reportedly being considered by Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe.Mr Ryan said the party wanted the carbon tax to increase to €90 per tonne (from the present €20 level) by 2030. He added that the system should be a “pay and idend” one where citizens would be entitled to receive the money back through either tax or social welfare systems.The party also announced that the Offaly councillor Pippa Hackett would be its candidate in the byelection caused by the election of its sole senator, Grace O’Sullivan, to the European parliament.Mr Ryan also told councillors and Oireachtas members that the party would be tabling a motion on just transition next week.

Photograph: Oli ScarffAFPGetty Images.Former UK prime minister David Cameron has admitted that he failed in his bid to keep Britain in a reformed European Union and is “truly sorry” for the uncertainty and ision that followed the Brexit referendum.The Conservative (52) said he thinks about the consequences of the vote to leave the EU “every single day” and worries “desperately” about what will happen next.In an interview with the Times ahead of the publication of his memoir next week, Mr Cameron also said a second referendum cannot be ruled out - suggesting it could provide a way of “unblocking the blockage”.And he attacked Boris Johnson and Michael Gove for their part in the Leave campaign, accusing the pair of behaving “appallingly” and effectively “trashing” the Government.Mr Cameron also said they had “left the truth at home” regarding Turkey joining the EU and the claim that Britain sends £350 million a week to the bloc.In his long-awaited book, For The Record, which is serialised in The Times, the ex-PM wrote that “there are those who will never forgive me for holding it, or for failing to deliver the outcome - Britain staying in a reformed EU - that I sought.“I deeply regret the outcome and accept that my approach failed. The decisions I took contributed to that failure. I failed.”He admitted that he has “many regrets” and that there are “many things” he would do differently about the vote, but insisted renegotiating Britain’s relationship with the EU and giving the country a say was the “right approach”.‘I am truly sorry’“I did not fully anticipate the strength of feeling that would be unleashed both during the referendum and afterwards, and I am truly sorry to have seen the country I love so much suffer uncertainty and ision in the years since then,” Mr Cameron said.“But on the central question of whether it was right to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU and give people the chance to have their say on it, my view remains that this was the right approach to take.“I believe that, particularly with the Eurozone crisis, the organisation was changing before our very eyes, and our already precarious place in it was becoming harder to sustain.“Renegotiating our position was my attempt to address that, and putting the outcome to a public vote was not just fair and not just overdue, but necessary and, I believe, ultimately inevitable.”In an interview with the paper, he also took aim at Priti Patel’s “attack that wealthy people didn’t understand the problems of immigration”.“It felt very like she was put on point to do some attacking of the government and its record. I suppose some people would say all is fair in love and war and political campaigns.“I thought there were places Conservatives wouldn’t go against each other. And they did.”And he revealed that he once texted Mr Gove, now Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to say: “You are either a team player or a w**ker.”Mr Cameron also confessed that he got “off his head” on dope while at Eton, and said he smoked it later with his wife Samantha and her friends.On Boris JohnsonThe former PM - who said he had been “hugely depressed” about leaving Number 10 - described Mr Johnson as “easy to work with” but admitted that there had been “issues” between the pair.“I want him to succeed. I worked with him well, as I say in the book. I also say that he was a capable mayor. He was easy to work with. I thought he was very talented. I wanted him in my government,” he explained.“We’ve had issues. Even before Brexit, there were sometimes tensions and disagreements but, on the whole, we’ve got on well. And I want him to succeed.“Look, he’s got a very clear strategy and plan. It’s, you know, not the approach that I would have taken, but I want him to succeed.”But on the new Prime Minister’s recent decision to prorogue Parliament for five weeks and withdraw the whip from 21 Tory MPs - including the likes of Ken Clarke and Sir Nicholas Soames - Mr Cameron expressed his disapproval.“Taking the whip from hard-working Conservative MPs and sharp practices using prorogation of Parliament have rebounded. I didn’t support either of those things. Neither do I think a no-deal Brexit is a good idea,” he said.On Friday Mr Johnson said he was not concerned about what his predecessor would write about him in the memoir.“I want people to be clear, absolutely nothing that David Cameron says in his memoirs in the course of the next few days will diminish the affection and respect in which I hold him.“Not least for what he did in turning this country round after Labour left it bankrupt.

We do a salsa and a waltz. The celebrities do, like, four steps and then we sort of move on.”A fellow dancer, Dianne Buswell, said she referred to the process as “speed dating”.As the celebrities dance with each professional in turn, producers walk around the room observing which pairings have the greatest chemistry.The celebrities and professionals at this year\u0026#39s Strictly launch showFootage of this year’s session will be included in a BBC One special, Strictly The Professionals, to be broadcast this Saturday.It features interviews with former contestants. Jake Wood, the EastEnders actor, said the event was unnerving: “The producers all walk around and you’re not sure what they’re looking at,” he said.Mollie King, the singer and 2017 semi-finalist, joked that “all of us female contestants danced with all of the pro boys and it was one of the best moments of my life, just being swung from man to man”.Brian Conley, the comedian, said the professional dancers were more interested in where the celebrities were based than their dancing ability.He recalled: “Everyone will come up to you and say, ‘Hello, where do you live?’ I thought, why does everyone want to know where I live? And it’s because they know they’ve got to rehearse with you and they don’t want to be too far away from London.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

When they first spotted it, they thought they had accidentally looked a star – but further research has shown that the black hole is in fact showing behaviour that astronomers had never expected.“We have never seen anything like this in the 24 years we have studied the supermassive black hole,” said Andrea\u0026nbspGhez, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and a co-senior author of the research. “It’s usually a pretty quiet, wimpy black hole on a diet.We don’t know what is driving this big feast.”Scientists looked through observations taken since 2003, from observatories in Hawaii and Chile. They noticed that on 13 May, the back hole was lit up twice as bright as had ever been before – and it continued to turn incredibly bright on two other nights this year.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

As such, it could be just the beginning in a major change in the activity of the black hole.“The big question is whether the black hole is entering a new phase — for example if the spigot has been turned up and the rate of gas falling down the black hole ‘drain’ has increased for an extended period — or whether we have just seen the fireworks from a few unusual blobs of gas falling in,” said Mark Morris, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and the author of a paper describing the discovery..Scientists will now keep looking at the area and hope that new images can help resolve that question. That could in turn help us understand how black holes grow and the kinds of effects they have on the galaxy and the larger universe.The brightening could have come from the fact that a star was seen going very close to the black hole in summer last year, or that another mysterious object known as G2 had its outer layer ripped off when it passed by in 2014. It might also be the result of big asteroids passing near the black hole, scientists said.The black hole poses no danger to life on Earth. It is 26,000 light years away, and the radiation coming out of it would need to be 10 billion times brighter to have any effect here.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would speed up progress on a Brexit deal acceptable both to the UK and the EU, as the so-called Irish backstop has been a major stumbling block.DUP leader Arlene Foster rejected the speculation, saying late on Thursday: UK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that ides the internal market of the UK.”Still, the pound gained more than 1 per cent against the dollar on Friday morning to trade as high as $1.2475, a seven-week high.

The former London mayor and foreign secretary won his leadership bid by beating Jeremy Hunt in the Tory race the day before. Theresa May stepped down following her resignation as Conservative Party leader on 7 June.“It’s clearly about a reduction in no-deal risk being perceived,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets. He noted that shorting, or betting against, sterling has become a very “crowded” – and hence less attractive – trade, prompting traders to bet the other way which also lifted the currency.Last week MPs passed a law preventing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and refused to grant Boris Johnson an early general election, which he hoped would give him a majority in parliament.But the chances of leaving with an exit agreement are also uncertain as the only deal agreed with the EU after two years of talks has been rejected by Britain’s parliament three times.Since the vote to leave the EU, the pound has lost 17 per cent against the dollar and almost 15 per cent against the euro. \u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK would also be on track for a four-day working week by 2040.“Hour by hour, day by day, we are giving an unnecessarily large proportion of our lives over to work,” said Aidan Harper, researcher at the NEF, noting that the average British worker spends 4,512 hours on unpaid overtime over their career.\u0026nbspThat amounts to over half a year of unpaid work.A study by the TUC earlier this year also found that the typical full-time employee in the UK puts in 42 hours a week – nearly two hours more than the average across the EU and equivalent to an extra two and a half weeks a year.Mr Harper added: “In a fair and just society free time would be viewed as an essential resource which we have a claim upon… It would mean building an economy that ensures that the gains of economic activity are shared evenly with workers not only in the form of pay but also in the form of working time reduction.”One explanation for the stagnation in working hours since 1980 may be a fall in trade union membership, as well as less strict labour market regulation, the NEF said. The think tank will publish a fuller report on this trend later in the autumn.Last month, the NEF said an increase in leisure time will help accelerate growth in Britain’s productivity, which has slowed down sharply since the financial crisis. Giving people more paid time off work will enable them to spend more, boosting demand in the economy and encouraging firms to invest, according to research by the think tank.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We will not be doing a reboot.“There are two reasons for that, explained Kauffman.One of the reasons we won’t do a reunion is because this is a show about a time in your life when your friends are your family. And when you have a family, that changes. But the other reason is it’s not going to beat what we did.”Co-creator David Crane added: “We did the show we wanted to do. We got it right, and we put a bow on it. If you visited those characters now, it just would not be the same DNA and chances are, it wouldn’t be as good.”Created with Sketch.29 TV shows that have been made into bad films Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Joe Carnahan’s dusty and grimy adaptation retained the catchphrases and character personalities of the original series, while surrounding them with an entirely incoherent plot and noisy sub-Michael Bay action. Liam Neeson made for a fun Hannibal Smith and UFC fighter Quinton “Rampage” Jackson did his best as BA Baracus, but a never-more-slappable Bradley Cooper and the chronically unappealing Sharlto Copley were the pits.A sad-all-round adaptation of the cult MTV animated series from the 1990s, Aeon Flux abandoned the avant-garde, largely dialogue-free sensuality of its source material for generic action and dodgy special effects. If it weren’t for the classy presence of Charlize Theron and director Karyn Kusama, whose early cut was radically altered by producers, this would have basically been a bargain-bin Milla Jovovich joint. And that, honestly, would have been a lot more fun.Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman must have been grateful when Marvel came along and helped scrub 1998 film The Avengers even further out of cultural memory. But for those who had to endure their hammy 1998 adaptation of the classic spy series, it’d take a lot more than Iron Man and Captain America to make us forget the image of Sean Connery inexplicably dressed in a giant bear costume and trying to control the weather. Shudders.Although The Bad Education Movie arrived in a similar summertime slot to the successful Inbetweeners film, this sitcom adaptation was nowhere near as popular. Jack Whitehall’s performance was panned by critics who said he appeared “desperate to shock” as delinquent teacher Alfie Wickers and described the whole movie as a “farce”.This 1977 film based on BBC sitcom Are You Being Served? took its inspiration from a theatre production in Blackpool. While it found success on stage, the big screen version was met with hostility, with one critic calling it guilty of violating almost every law of comedy and film.David Hasselhoff is unforgettable as the hunky chief lifeguard Mitch Buchannon patrolling a sunny beach in Baywatch. After a rocky start when the first season was cancelled on NBC, it became the world\u0027s most-watched TV show, running in its original format for 10 years until 1999. The unnecessary big-screen version of the show starred Dwayne Johnson in Hasselhoff’s role and Zac Efron as a new recruit. Even the nostalgic cameo from the show\u0027s former star didn’t make up for the paper-thin plot.Because nose-centric glory for Nicole Kidman couldn’t happen twice, this adaptation of sparkly magical sitcom Bewitched arrived two years after the actor won her Oscar for The Hours, and promptly became a key component in her Queen of Flops reputation throughout the late-2000s. This had brilliance written all over it, from Nora Ephron behind the camera to Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman and Shirley MacLaine in the supporting cast, but still somehow managed to stink.Leigh Francis character Keith Lemon received the big screen treatment in 2012\u0027s Keith Lemon: The Film, one of the only titles to have ever received zero per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. Putting pins in one\u0027s eyes is rumoured to be a better experience.Despite an all-star cast that included Bill Nighy, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Gambon and Tony Jones, the poorly judged spin-off of the much-loved BBC sitcom Dad\u0027s Army (2016) took a pounding from critics, who derided the attempt at an homage to a TV show that had nothing wrong with it in the first place.The nadir of Tim Burton’s career, Dark Shadows was a film nobody was particularly crying out for, most of the fans of the original 1960s fantasy soap opera long dead and the general public having by then grown tired of Johnny Depp’s “heavily made-up comedy weirdo” schtick. Most egregious, however, was the film’s failure to properly utilise Michelle Pfeiffer 20 years after she played Catwoman in Burton’s Batman Returns.Julian Fellowes took the beloved TV drama about the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and the people who serve them – and turned it into one long fawning session about the royals. Absolutely nothing happens in this film where an entire sub-plot involves a boiler being fixed, and another, completely implausible storyline about an assassination attempt on the king. The only real intrigue is why Thomas, the butler, has suddenly acquired a very orange tan. This is what happens when British institutions get a Hollywood makeover, folks.1229 The Dukes of HazzardThere was a time when Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson were the hottest cast in town. There was never a time this unwanted cinematic revival of the action comedy series wasn\u0027t entirely stupid. Life imitated art when the main stars at the heart of HBO show Entourage hit the red carpet for the film version. Sadly, it lacked the vim that was present in most seasons of the show and ultimately felt like a mediocre feature-length episode.Kevin and Perry Go Large was no doubt adored by teens everywhere upon its released in 2000, which is why it\u0027s gained a cult following in the years since. In all honesty, the film is so terrible it\u0027s actually brilliant.1529 The League of Gentlemen2005 film The League of Gentlemen\u0027s Apocalypse is proof that Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, Mark Gatiss and Jeremy Dyson can do wrong. On the bright side, it\u0027s reassuring to know the multi-talented quartet are indeed human after all. It\u0027s not exactly clear who The Magic Roundabout film was intended for considering kids at the time would have had no idea who Dougal, Zebedee or company were. Save for providing work for Robbie Williams, Tom Baker and Bill Nighy, this version wasn’t much use for anyone. We are all to blame for the abysmal Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys D\u0027Movie. If the sitcom\u0027s Christmas specials weren\u0027t the most-watched episodes of television in the UK every year, then Brendan O\u0027Carroll probably wouldn’t have ever thought a film could be possible. Ricky Gervais just couldn\u0027t stay away from his Office character David Brent and gave him the big screen treatment in 2016\u0027s Life on the Road. Every second paled in comparison to ever single episode of the classic BBC series.The experience of watching the first ever Pokémon film – titled Pokémon: The First Movie – can be likened to watching a YouTube tutorial of someone playing a Pokémon video game, only somehow more boring.The charming story of Postman Pat and his black and white cat in the fictional and busy village of Greendale first screened on the BBC in 1981. What a shame that Postman Pat: The Movie in 2014 – the 3D animated feature film version – managed to stray so far from its original simplicity. It sees Postman Pat (voiced by Stephen Mangan) enter an X-Factor style-singing contest, and despite featuring an impressive array of voice actors, including Rupert Grint, Jim Broadbent and David Tennant, the film was too scary for the under-fives – especially the scene that sees Pat turn into a sinister robot.2129 Sex and the CitySex and the City had all the ingredients for a great movie: starry cast, cult fanbase, glamorous setting. Alas, both films were an embarrassment to the original series. Not enough happened in the movies to warrant anything longer than a 30-minute episode and unfortunately we can never unsee Sarah Jessica Parker and co doing that bizarre slo-mo walk through the desert.The problem with 2015 film Spooks: The Greater Good is that is arrived about 10 years too late. Spooks was a decent BBC drama that ended in 2011 and that\u0027s how it should have stayed.Based on the 1975 series of the same name, this action crime thriller starred Samuel L Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Jeremy Renner, and Colin Farrell in one of his early box office hits. There was plenty of high-octane drama and Farrell was convincing as a hot-shot cop taking on a French drug lord (Olivier Martinez), but it’s also completely predictable and, ultimately, extremely pointless.An updated version of BBC crime series The Sweeney starring Ray Winstone sounds like something from spoof heaven. The finished film, released in 2012, didn\u0027t really do much to convince anyone that it wasn\u0027t. Sure, Ben Kingsley as The Hood is a great spot of casting, but practically everything else in the film version of Gerry Anderson\u0027s Thunderbirds failed to make the grade. Anderson himself was most damning he called it the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life.There are some interesting things in Twilight Zone: The Movie, but it loses points for featuring one of the worst pieces of work from Steven Spielberg: a segment set in a retirement home titled Kick the Can.Just because the Veronica Mars cast and its loyal fans really wanted a movie spin-off to be made, it doesn’t mean it should have ever actually happened. The TV show was revived thanks to funds raised by star Kristen Bell on Kickstarter, but the film was criticised for making literally no sense for anyone who hadn’t watched the series.Famously bad, Wild Wild West was adapted from the 1960s TV show and was the 2000 recipient of the golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.Joe Carnahan’s dusty and grimy adaptation retained the catchphrases and character personalities of the original series, while surrounding them with an entirely incoherent plot and noisy sub-Michael Bay action.

The TV show was revived thanks to funds raised by star Kristen Bell on Kickstarter, but the film was criticised for making literally no sense for anyone who hadn’t watched the series.Famously bad, Wild Wild West was adapted from the 1960s TV show and was the 2000 recipient of the golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.Kauffman and Crane also revealed disagreements they had over the pilot episode with an NBC executive, who they claim effectively slut-shamed Courtney Cox’s character Monica.In the pilot, Monica sleeps with Paul The Wine Guy on the first date after he tells her that since his wife left him, he hasn’t been able to perform sexually.Shortly afterwards, Monica discovers that her co-worker was told the same thing and also slept with Paul, so she never speaks to him again.“The person who was the head of NBC at the time felt that Monica got what she deserved for sleeping with a guy on the first date,” Kauffman revealed, adding that this unnamed executive painted the character as a “slut” or “whore”.Describing her fury at the situation, Kauffman added: “Fire was coming out of my nose.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The new phone includes a chip referred to as U1, and which it says is used for sensing things in space.For now, it is only being used for a new feature that uses Apple\u0027s AirDrop technology, and allows people to point their phones towards another device and send files between the two. The chip can be used to precisely locate other devices, Apple said, meaning it can know exactly where it is pointing.But it is clear that the chip is really meant for a variety of other features, too. What is less clear is what exactly those features are.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Somewhat ironically, it appears under a heading indicating that it will allow the phone to be more precise.Which new iPhone should you buy? 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max comparedThe new Apple-designed U1 chip uses Ultra Wideband technology for spatial awareness – allowing iPhone 11 Pro to precisely locate other U1-equipped Apple devices, it reads. It\u0027s like adding another sense to iPhone, and it\u0027s going to lead to amazing new capabilities.Apple is already rumoured to be working on small tracking devices that could be added to objects to allow them to be found more easily. The phone could presumably seek out those devices – telling you not only how far away your keys are, for instance, but being able to work out which of your chairs they have fallen into, and where exactly they are.The chip could also presumably help with Apple\u0027s plans for augmented reality features. That requires detailed information about the nearby environment, which the chip could presumably help with.The chip is only found on the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, and not the cheaper iPhone 11.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In colour are active regions of the atmosphere of the Sun e.g. solar flares and coronal mass ejectionsThough the exoplanet was first spotted in 2015, new research has finally allowed scientists to reveal the existence of water.\u0026nbspCurrent equipment is only able to determine basic factors such as distance, mass and temperature but sophisticated tools developed at University College London helped\u0026nbsptranslate existing data from the Hubble Space Telescope to make sense of the unique molecule signatures of water vapour.K2-18b is classed as a super-Earth because it is bigger than our Earth – twice as big, as well as eight times heavier.K2-18b super-Earth (M\u0026nbspKornmesserESAHubbleAFP)K2-18b\u0026nbspis too far away for astronomers to see, but they can look at how starlight is filtered through the planet’s atmosphere as it passes around its own sun, called\u0026nbspK2-18.The planet is a lot closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun, meaning it only takes around 33 days to transit.“It’s the only planet outside our solar system that we know has the correct temperature, an atmosphere and water,” said lead\u0026nbspauthor Dr\u0026nbspAngelos\u0026nbspTsiaras.“Of course,\u0026nbspK2-18b\u0026nbspis not a second Earth, because it is a planet that is much bigger, has a different atmospheric composition. It’s orbiting a completely different star, so it doesn’t look like Earth.“The search for habitable planets, it’s very exciting, but it’s here to always remind us that this\u0026nbspis our only home and it’s probably out of the question if we will be able to travel to other planets.”Although the planet sits in the habitable zone, scientists say that instruments available at present are not able to determine any signs of life.Exoplanets will get real names rather than numbersMany more observations are needed\u0026nbspto be sure that it is\u0026nbsphabitable.Scientists, who have published their findings in the Nature Astronomy journal after more than a year of work, believe that the water content could be as low as 0.01 per cent\u0026nbspor as high as 50 per cent.“We don’t know how much water there is however, what these models clearly say is that there is an atmosphere and that there is water there,” said co-author Dr\u0026nbspIngo\u0026nbspWaldmann.Researchers do not think\u0026nbspK2-18b\u0026nbspis the only potentially habitable\u0026nbspsuper-Earth\u0026nbspand expect to find others with similar characteristics among more than 4,000 exoplanets that have already been discovered.They hope that newer technology, such as the James Webb Space Telescope due to launch in March 2021, will unlock more secrets beyond our solar system.“We are looking forward to the next generation of telescopes and going even further,” Dr\u0026nbspTsiaras\u0026nbspadded.Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would speed up progress on a Brexit deal acceptable both to the UK and the EU, as the so-called Irish backstop has been a major stumbling block.DUP leader Arlene Foster rejected the speculation, saying late on Thursday: UK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that ides the internal market of the UK.”Still, the pound gained more than 1 per cent against the dollar on Friday morning to trade as high as $1.2475, a seven-week high.

The former London mayor and foreign secretary won his leadership bid by beating Jeremy Hunt in the Tory race the day before. Theresa May stepped down following her resignation as Conservative Party leader on 7 June.“It’s clearly about a reduction in no-deal risk being perceived,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets. He noted that shorting, or betting against, sterling has become a very “crowded” – and hence less attractive – trade, prompting traders to bet the other way which also lifted the currency.Last week MPs passed a law preventing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and refused to grant Boris Johnson an early general election, which he hoped would give him a majority in parliament.But the chances of leaving with an exit agreement are also uncertain as the only deal agreed with the EU after two years of talks has been rejected by Britain’s parliament three times.Since the vote to leave the EU, the pound has lost 17 per cent against the dollar and almost 15 per cent against the euro. \u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The actual figure could be higher when Labour releases official totals next week.\u0026nbspMost of the motions submitted are based on a template saying Labour should “campaign energetically for a public vote and to Remain” and “support revoking Article 50 if necessary to prevent no deal”. They say the party should also “defend free movement and extend migrants’ rights”.It raises the prospect of a fresh battle between activists and the party leadership when the motion\u0026nbspis debated by delegates at the gathering. The text is likely to be amended during lengthy discussions to hammer out a compromise, with Mr Corbyn’s team and some trade unions expected to try to tone down some of the more anti-Brexit language.Michael Chessum, national organiser for Another Europe is Possible, said: “In an election, Labour needs the space to articulate a radical set of policies that will transform the economy and people’s lives. In government, it needs to be able to deliver on its promises. To have either of these things, we need to defeat Brexit and move the conversation on.“The public wants this to be over – any sense that we are going to engage in a lengthy renegotiation will be deeply unpopular. In government, Brexit would be an albatross around our necks – a pointless loss of time and energy, probably a loss of rights and protections and a fracturing of our support base.”Labour MP Clive Lewis, a supporter of the campaign, said: “As an MP, I know what wins elections for Labour – it’s our members, who are more than 90 per cent in favour of Remain.“Our army of volunteers aren’t just foot soldiers, they’re members of a democratic movement. They need to feel ownership over our Brexit policy, they need to be excited and enthused by it. Yes, the people should have the final say, but for our morale we need a clear anti-Brexit position in Labour. That means we must campaign in any public vote for Remain.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The UK would also be on track for a four-day working week by 2040.“Hour by hour, day by day, we are giving an unnecessarily large proportion of our lives over to work,” said Aidan Harper, researcher at the NEF, noting that the average British worker spends 4,512 hours on unpaid overtime over their career.\u0026nbspThat amounts to over half a year of unpaid work.A study by the TUC earlier this year also found that the typical full-time employee in the UK puts in 42 hours a week – nearly two hours more than the average across the EU and equivalent to an extra two and a half weeks a year.Mr Harper added: “In a fair and just society free time would be viewed as an essential resource which we have a claim upon… It would mean building an economy that ensures that the gains of economic activity are shared evenly with workers not only in the form of pay but also in the form of working time reduction.”One explanation for the stagnation in working hours since 1980 may be a fall in trade union membership, as well as less strict labour market regulation, the NEF said. The think tank will publish a fuller report on this trend later in the autumn.Last month, the NEF said an increase in leisure time will help accelerate growth in Britain’s productivity, which has slowed down sharply since the financial crisis. Giving people more paid time off work will enable them to spend more, boosting demand in the economy and encouraging firms to invest, according to research by the think tank.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The result was television on a scale rarely seen in Tunisia’s modern history, with 11 of the country’s television channels carrying the debate, alongside 20 radio stations.From an initial field of almost 100, including the Middle East’s first openly gay candidate, the field has been whittled down to 26, all of whom now vie for the position of head of state.\u0026nbspAppearing alongside relative outsiders, such as idiosyncratic law professor\u0026nbspKais Saied and Abir Moussi, an avowed apologist for Tunisia’s pre-revolutionary regime, were establishment stalwarts, Chahed, defence minister Abdelkarim Zbidi and the first presidential candidate to be fielded by moderate Islamists Ennahda, Abdelfattah Mourou.In cafes around the capital, crowds spilled out onto the street as Tunisians gathered to watch their potential leaders trade in soundbites for the chance to proceed to the second round of voting, the date for which has yet to be announced. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNevertheless, despite Karoui’s absence, rumours of private polls conducted by various international agencies suggest the momentum of his insurgent campaign may not have been dented by his absence.

In the febrile atmosphere of the presidential campaign, much of the substance of the charges against\u0026nbspKaroui\u0026nbspand his brother, which were initially brought by anti-corruption watchdog,\u0026nbspIWatch, in 2016, are often overlookedYoussef Chahed (AP)In the build-up to the campaigning period, his television station\u0026nbspNessma TV made great play of images of Karoui distributing aid via his charitable association, Khalil Tounes, to the overlooked interior regions while railing against the shortcomings of Chahed and his government.“Populists and outsiders benefit from the general discontent about the bad economic conditions,” Tunisian political analyst Youssef Cherif tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“They promise to change things and they point to the factclaim that they have nothing to do with the current conditions, that they’ll do better. So people, in search of hope, believe them and fall for their rhetoric.”Always perceived as something of a maverick, Riahi has yet to greatly trouble Tunisia’s political conscience.He fled the country in November after he accused of Chahed and his immediate circle of plotting a coup d’etat. The charges were swiftly dismissed by the military court Riahi had lodged them with.Populists and outsiders benefit from the general discontent about the bad economic conditionsHowever, the accusation reinforced the perception among parts of Tunisia’s political class who sought to portray the prime minister as a tyrant, a perception Karoui’s team made much play of during his campaign, significantly ratcheting up their denunciations of official complicity in the businessman’s arrest on 23 August. \u0026nbspInstead, Karoui’s supporters cast them, and the delay in bringing them to court, as further evidence of an orchestrated campaign to silence their “Nelson Mandela of Tunisia”.Meet the man hoping to become the Muslim world’s first gay presidentTheir claims are not entirely without substance.In May, the outspoken television mogul had his channel taken off air after armed police raided his offices in central Tunis alleging breaches of broadcasting guidelines.In July, shortly after Karoui established his lead in the last of the official polls, the government passed an electoral amendment that would have essentially precluded him and a small number of rival candidates from running for president, legislation that former President Essebsi declined to either sign into law or return to parliament before his death.Irrespective of the claims of either camp, after years of marginalisation many within Tunisia are choosing to see the coming contest as one between the establishment class that has consistently overlooked them, and a fresh tranche of anti-system politicians that, like so many around the world, promise\u0026nbspto rewrite the rulebook in their favour. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

In practice, very few men — less than one in 16 — take advantage of their legal right, often because they fear retribution.Now two men in Japan who did take time off to care for newborns are suing their employers, saying the companies punished them with demotions and pay cuts after they returned from paternity leave.Their lawsuits, which are highly unusual in Japan, are prompting a discussion in the country about long-standing cultural norms and company expectations. Overwhelmingly in Japan, women still assume responsibility for the vast majority of child care while men are expected to show extreme loyalty to their employers at the expense of their families.The first hearing in one of the lawsuits took place in Tokyo District Court on Thursday, just a day after Japan’s new environment minister said he was considering taking paternity leave early next year.Because the minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, is married to Christel Takigawa, a celebrity television presenter, a full-blown media frenzy ensued. He remarked that the fuss about his decision — with both supporters and critics weighing in — indicated that Japan was “rigid” and “old-fashioned.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Rescue workers on a boat rescue a person stranded inside a flooded tunnel after heavy floods in Pilar de la Horadada, SpainPolice officers try to control the crowd after members of the public were invited to view Robert Mugabe\u0027s body as it lies in state at the Rufaro stadium in Harare, ZimbabweA US flag hangs from a steel girder, damaged in the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center at a memorial in Jersey City.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half.

A former education minister, Hirokazu Matsuno, said in June that if men took paternity leave it would help more women work and potentially help increase the country’s birthrate.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he understood that more men wanted to take paternity leave. “But there is a certain atmosphere and environment in companies or society which make them feel it is difficult to take it,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The man, Glen Wood, alleges that he was demoted and eventually fired after he took paternity leave. Next month, the first public hearing is expected in his lawsuit.Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley has denied paternity harassment and said it intends to fight the allegations in court, according to the Associated Press.In the hearing Thursday, an employee of Asics, the sneaker maker, said he had been subjected to harassment and demotion both before and after he took paternity leave. The plaintiff, who requested anonymity because he fears he and his family will be attacked on social media, is seeking damages of close to $85,000.According to his legal complaint, the man, who is 38, started his career at Asics in 2011, working in the sports promotion department, often as a liaison between athletes and the company. His first demotion — to menial tasks such as scheduling fleet cars for maintenance — came after he alleged that one of his bosses drove drunk and that a colleague slapped him at a work party, according to his complaint.His second demotion came when he returned to work after his first paternity leave of just over a year following the 2015 birth of his first son, his complaint alleges. The company assigned him to a warehouse loading and unloading goods, the complaint says. Eventually, he was transferred to the human resources department and his salary was cut.The plaintiff’s complaint says that after he finished a paternity leave with his second son, one that also lasted more than a year, he returned to his previous job in the human resources department, where he had been assigned to translate documents into English, despite having no expertise in translation.On social media, critics who have heard about the case in the Japanese press have attacked the plaintiff for taking so much time off.“Don’t think that you’ll have a place to belong when you, a man, take child care leave for two years\u0026nbsplol lol,” wrote one commentator on Twitter. “You should be thankful that they’re even allowing you to do warehouse work. You didn’t work at all for two years, so don’t try to think you’re just the same as the other employees.”Asics issued a statement saying that many of the allegations are “against the facts” and that it regretted not reaching a settlement with its employee.Asics said it planned to continue improving its “work environment and support systems so that employees can actively participate in work even in the period of their pregnancy, childbearing or child care.”Analysts said it is not surprising that the few men who do take paternity leave are subject to pressure from their employers and colleagues.Japanese work culture is very demanding, with employees putting in long hours late into the evenings and on weekends. Breaking long-standing patterns is difficult for workers, who not only fear they may be punished by their employers but may also believe that the success of their companies depends on their personal sacrifices.Fewer than third of new fathers take paternity leave, study showsDads who don\u0027t take paternity leave have no idea what it\u0027s likeThe best companies for maternity and paternity pay, revealed“Men still believe that as long as they work seriously and hard in the company, then society and the family will function very well,” said Naoto Sasayama, a lawyer who is representing the Asics employee. “That is the illusion they are still trying to cling to.”Many Japanese employees have a strong sense that they will impose too heavily on their colleagues if they take a leave.“If a male full-time employee who is involved in decision-making or a core part of a project wants to take paternity leave for months, some people may question that,” said Makoto Yoshida, a professor of industrial labour sociology at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto.Wood’s lawyer, Yoshitatsu Imaizumi, said he hoped that the recent paternity harassment cases might pave the way for other fathers, and make it easier for other men to exercise their right to care for their children.“In Japan, there are a lot of good laws on the books,” said Imaizumi. “But the problem is that few labourers exercise their rights under the law. We need some courageous people to exercise their rights and stand up in society.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Theresa May gave lordships and knighthoods to her Brexit-blocking favourites.And Commons Speaker John Bercow allowed Remainers to coat him with unctuous praise after he said he was off to spend more time with his £million pension pot.After the vain and aggressive Bercow announced he will finally quit at the end of October, he allowed MPs to spend the next hour and a half nishing him with a weird mix of treacle and bulls**t.“Ah, Mr Snodgrass, you want to say what a marvellous chap I am  The floor is yours.”And yes, they really did go on for an appalling, toe-curling hour and a half — even while they were moaning about being short of time to discuss Brexit.Long after closing time in most pubs, a group of anti-Brexit MPs engineered a physical tussle around the Speaker’s Chair.They hoped their stunt would symbolise their disapproval of Boris Johnson closing down this madhouse parliament for a few weeks in his “prorogation” gambit, which has been approved by the courts.What a pathetic spectacle ensued. One prize prat, Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, tried to jump into Bercow’s lap, pleading with him not to leave the Chamber.It was like seeing a poodle try to jump on to its mistress’s knees.Russell-Moyle was then yanked out of the way by Bercow’s tailcoated minders, and some baby boxing wrists were flapped — handbags at midnight. Classy, eh Some of the House’s most verbose MPs held up sheets of paper saying, “Silenced”.They bleated, “Shame!” and booed when the twirly ceremonial closure of the House began. Bercow added to the hysteria by screaming abuse at Tory MPs.The country must have looked at these maniacs and thought: “Oh do act your age.” What will the outside world have made of it all You occasionally see TV news footage of punch-ups in foreign parliaments, places like Taiwan and Turkey and Uganda.This time the farcical argy-bargy was happening in our own House of Commons. Vladimir Putin must be laughing so hard his plastic surgery may soon rip.Our allies in places such as the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand must be slapping their foreheads and thinking: “What on earth has happened to the once-calm, reasonable United Kingdom.Can we really do business with this deranged political elite that is ignoring a national referendum ” Theresa May’s resignation honours list was little better.It has long been the custom — heaven knows why — for departing Prime Ministers to nominate a few friends for honours. That practice must now, surely, please be reviewed.Apart from the knighthoods for cricketers Andrew Strauss and Geoffrey Boycott , Mrs May rewarded a bunch of no-hopers in her political circle.Peerages went to her useless chief of staff Gavin Barwell and to her Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins, the civil servant with whom May bypassed elected Cabinet ministers before the Chequers summit of .Various spin doctors were on May’s list, too. Ditto former deputy PMDavid Lidington and big-bucks Tory donors Ehud Sheleg and David Brownlow.One of the few creditable things about Mrs May used to be that she resisted dishing out honours to her mates. Now she has blown even that part of her reputation.If Mrs May had managed to get us out of the EU, as instructed by the electorate, that might have just about passed the smell test.But these drongos were a catastrophic flop. The May team pursued a “Brexit in name only” and could not even achieve that.Honouring them is like giving an open-topped bus ride through the streets to a football team that has just been relegated. What will voters make of this gongs-for-the-boys culture A harmless bit of fun  Or a remote parliamentary crowd giving twirly titles to a long line of sub-par operatives The worst thing is that few of us are surprised by this stuff. I don’t suppose many of us genuinely believe politicians’ promises any more.How can we, when they said they would “honour the referendum” but now tell Boris Johnson to go to Brussels with a surrender letter This same elite, which so casually bungs honours to its pals, always sneers at the word “populist” as being something almost dirty.Instead, it wants the status quo. But the status quo, as we can see, is this gang of grotesques who are histrionically opposed to Brexit and who are so greedily self-rewarding.Why on earth is Jeremy Corbyn so keen on them  The country is desperate for change from these crooks and limpets. We want to get rid of them. Yet Corbyn’s Labour wants to keep them in power. He has become the establishment’s stooge.If populism is the alternative to Bercow and Co, that sounds pretty good to me. Boris Johnson has already shown himself ready to upset the elite. Let’s have more of that.If it takes some sort of electoral pact with Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, who cares  The elite has chosen to float away from us.

And it won’t officially say which it would back.They’re fooling absolutely no one.And what “Leave option” would this be, anyway  Some fantasy Labour deal, even softer than Theresa May’s That would be blatantly unfair to Leavers, since many want No Deal.But then Remainers are no longer even pretending their second vote will be fair.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The whining. The complaining from both sidesabout a lack of democracy.The snarled fury. The endless bloody ponticating.It’s been more than three years and still nobody knows what the hell Labour’s policy is.Get a deal from Brussels and then vote against it, so far as I can discern.God only knows what sort of drugs old man Steptoe and his magic band of brothers are on.But then I’m not too sure what BoJo is up to either, and this is a problem.My guess is thatour Prime Minister wrestles some kind of deal from Brussels, the vast majority of the country will heave an enormous sigh of relief.We can all get on with our lives. Boris can busy himself with building very large bridges across the Irish Sea. Whatever deal he gets, it won’t be a proper Brexit.I have always said, right from day one, that our liberal establishment would never let us leave.And the sort of deal Boris is inching towards now will not be what we might call a full Brexit.It will involve, at the least, selling out the Northern Irish. Over the blessed “backstop”. And here’s the problem for Johnson.If he does that there will still be a large contingent of people very unhappy indeed — and not just the DUP.It means he won’t be able to strike a meaningful deal with Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party.And that, in turn, means the ­Conservative Party will go into the next election, which is coming very soon, with only a slender hope of victory.The Brexit Party is likely to take enough votes from the Tories to ensure they do not win.That would mean — at best — a hung parliament. And you can bet some sort of coalition deal will be struck between Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP.This would result in a rejection of any deal. And almost certainly a second ­referendum on whether we should leave or not.Except that the choices on the ballot paper next time will be gerrymandered to ensure Remain wins .But what  is Boris to do We can’t leave with No Deal — the best option of those available right now — because ­Parliament won’t let him. His hands are tied.He started well in the job, did old BoJo. But things have fallen apart in the past two weeks.He hasn’t helped himself by estranging the Remainers in his party by kicking them out.Evenwe won’t miss them for a fraction of a nanosecond.And he should have been in Brussels from day one, negotiating.If only to show the British public the sheer bloody-minded intransigence and spite of the European Union.Still,he manages to wrench some sort of deal now, at the last moment, I’d be tempted to be in favour of it.Not because it’s what I voted for. But because it’s probably the least worst of all available options.Andhe then loses an election and the present Opposition revokes the deal, all hell will break loose.Yes, whatever way you look at it, this business is going to drag on and on. Until we’re all bored into stupefaction.THE BBC is in trouble after it accidentally showed some rude comments on screen.They were running a piece about cyber- trolling.And they showed a clip of plus-size model Jada Sezer, with a comment from online saying: “I want to **** you’re ***”.People have complained about the BBC’s low standards. And rightly.It should be “I want to **** YOUR ***”, not “you’re”.AT last the toxic little hobgoblin John Bercow is to stand down.The Speaker of the House of Commons will not be fighting his seat at the next election.This may well be because the Tories have announced they will stand against him. And they’d win.He has been a disgrace to his office. Gobby, pompous, egotistical and, worst of all, blatantly partisan.Pray God soon we will never have to hear from him again.Sixteen shops closed down every day in the first half of this year.Few are coming in to replace them.Two things occur.First, was it really such a good idea to shove massive retail parks, all selling the same tat, on the outskirts of our towns and cities And second, how about reducing business rates for independent ­retailers WELL, at least Robert Mugabe won’t be murdering more folk any time soon.I was just starting out as a journo when he took power, back in .I asked his predecessor, Ian Smith, how he thought Mugabe would manage the country.“He will cause mass starvation and kill all of his political opponents,” Smith replied.Not a bad call, really.But Mugabe is still revered in Africa for sticking it to whitey.People known as “England fans”.Something the ­ will never get.THINGS are hotting up a bit with Iran, aren’t they Their oil tanker illegally ships supplies to Syria.British-flagged vessels were impounded in the Straits of Hormuz.

We should back the US, which pulled out of a deal with the mad mullahs last year.And keep a few Navy frigates on hand in case there’s more trouble.THE Archbishop of Canterbury is in India, lying on the floor and grovelling.Justin Welby lay flat out to apologise for the massacre of Indians by British troops at ­Amritsar in .“I am deeply ashamed,” he told his hosts.Why  Were you there, mate If so it would be right to apologise – and then face a prison sentence, frankly.But you weren’t there, were you Apologising for the sins of others is just another example of virtue-signalling.DID you see the ­hideous footage of a -year-old female bullfighter trying to kill a calf in Spain It took SEVEN stabs from her sword before the poor creature was killed.It had already had four banderillas sticking out of its  back.What an utterly vile ­spectacle.

Bigger than  football pitches, it has room for , staff.It’s now clear that, far from harming the Square Mile, Brexit will help London cement its place as the world’s leading financial hub.Now the Project Fear merchants issue blood-curdling warnings against a No Deal Brexit, making it impossible for Boris Johnson to negotiate with Brussels.Ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond says leaving against the EU’s wishes would cost Britain £billion — equivalent to a whopping four per cent of our annual GDP — doing damage “equivalent to the  financial crash”.Spreadsheet Phil’s meltdown scenario, based on those same  Treasury forecasts, lacks all credibility.EU trade accounts for barely a tenth of the UK economy. Just eight per cent of our firms do business with the -member bloc.The idea Brexit would cause a shock equal to the largest peace-time slowdown in a century, when the entire world economy slumped, is absurd.No Deal is constantly demonised by those who “respect the Referendum result” but are really Brexit-blockers. Preparations have been made on all sides to minimise any disruption.Agreements have been struck so exports will keep flowing and planes will fly.Phone roaming charges won’t change, as the big ­telecom outfits have now ­confirmed.Trade agreements with our most important global customers have been agreed or are in the works.What the doom-mongers don’t mention is that No Deal could mean lower prices for food and consumer goods such as clothing and footwearthe UK drops high tarfs on imports from outside the EU which, for now, Brussels forces us to impose.It is rarely acknowledged that the Irish government has admitted there won’t be new physical infrastructure in ­sensitive locations, and customs checks can happen away from the Irish border.When did you last hear on the TV news that UK exports to the EU have fallen from  per cent of goods we sold abroad  years ago to just  per cent now — despite the much-vaunted single market and customs union it would apparently be so disastrous to leave And why are we never told UK trade outside the EU is now not only the majority of our trade, but is fast-growing, produces a surplus and is conducted largely under World Trade Organisation rules Of course the future is not without danger. Indeed, there is a huge great threat on the horizon that could smash this prosperity to smithereens.And that is a hard-Left Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn, who this week pledged to make it easier for workers to strike, threatening ato the dark days of the s.Polling from Financial News suggests City investors would rather a No Deal Brexit than Corbyn taking over as Prime Minister — and rightly so.Speaking to his trade union paymasters at the TUC on Tuesday, this Magic Grandpa pledged to sweep aside long-standing anti-strike rules, opening the floodgates to widespread industrial action.A Corbyn government would cause havoc — threatening ato the Britain of my childhood, when we ended up being bailed out, going “cap in hand” to the International Monetary Fund.The damage he would inflict would be catastrophic. What forward-thinking firm would want to invest in a country where the government would take ten per cent of your companyyou happen to be successful enough to employ more than  people That’s what Corbyn and his Marxist dreamers are planning.And the wind in their sails blows hard, thanks not to their appeal on the doorstep — two thirds of Brits think him indecisive and incompetent, according to a recent YouGov poll.No, Comrade Corbyn has been helped by the Remainer corporate establishment, in turn assisted by gloomy Remainer economists and an overwhelmingly Remainer media class, which has railed against a genuine Brexit.It’s now threatening to overturn the  Referendum result altogether. That would mean thwarting Prime Minister Boris Johnson, evenhe can only offer No Deal, which could easily result in Corbyn entering No.But any No Deal damage would be minimal and ­temporary.

For a packet of  cigarettes the saving will be as much as £. But Hancock, it appears, will not be celebrating.He has complained that he wasn’t consulted about the Chancellor’s plan to reintroduce duty free on trips from EU countries, and that it will help to undermine the Department of Health’s campaigns to persuade us to smoke and drink less.Obviously, that is good advice. But is anyone really going to take up smoking or go on a drinking binge just because it becomes a little cheaper to buy cigarettes and alcohol at an airport Duty free is a harmless little treat for ing holiday- makers — something to ensure we remain in good cheer for a few weeks after wefrom holiday, or a little in the way of compensationit rained all week on our Spanish beach.Duty free, as anyone over  will remember, used to be a staple part of a foreign holiday. The concept arose because once we have passed through security at a port or airport, we are deemed for tax purposes already to have left the country.Customs and Excise authorities concluded, there- fore, that they had no right to charge us duties designed to capture taxes from domestic consumption.We are theoretically still liable to pay duty on goods when we are entering a country. But in practice most countries will waive duty on small quantities of alcoholic drinks and tobacco products brought in by arriving passengers.As a result, passengers arriving in Britain from non-EU countries are currently allowed to bring back up to four litres of still wine, a litre of spirits,  litres of beer and  cigarettes without paying duty.For passengers arriving in Britain from other EU countries, however, the rules changed in  — seven years after the creation of the single market.Duty free was abolished for people travelling between EU countries. In some ways, the single market was more generous than the previous duty-free regime.Rather than just four litres of wine, for example, we are now allowed to bring unlimited quantities of wine without paying UK duty, so long as it is only for personal consumption.Given that the duty on wine is a lot lower in France than in Britain, we can save a small fortune by stocking up in a French hypermarket.What the EU single market did stop, however, was our ability to travel, say, from France to Britain without paying duty in either country. What Sajid Javid wants to do is to give us the best of both worlds.From October  — assuming we leave the EU without continuing to be subject to the rules of the single market — we will regain our duty-free allowances.But, in addition, we will continue to be allowed to bring unlimited quantities of alcohol and tobacco which we bought in France and which we intend to use only for personal consumption.The main beneficiaries of duty free, needless to say, are smokers and drinkers. But you don’t have to smoke or drink in order to benefit from its existence.The profits from duty free allow airlines and ferry operators to keep their ticket prices down. When the EU proposed to abolish duty free in the s, the travel industry calculated that , jobs in the UK were dependent on its existence.That was no doubt exaggerated for effect, and of course the budget airline industry has grown hugely in the past  years.Butwe want to be able to continue to fly to Spain for a tenner , the reintroduction of duty free is going to be a signicant influence on what airlines can offer by way of cheap tickets.The fuss over Sajid Javid’s proposal has reopened isions in the Government over so-called “sin taxes” on booze and fags.For some, like Matt Hancock, who this week praised the sugar levy on fizzy drinks, sin taxes are a useful instrument for persuading us to lead healthier lives.

This is because they are so far apart that architects had to factor in the curvature of Earth.Today, it’s still as unnecessary as it ever was. And it’s no longer the longest suspension bridge in the world. But it remains, in my opinion, the most beautul.In fact, and I’ve said this often, it’s the most beautul man-made thing of all time. Apart from maybe the Riva Aquarama speedboat.When I stand on the south shore on a misty morning and see the wafer-thin road disappearing off into the sea, it takes my breath away. It really does.So I’m glad it was made. And I’m glad too that the Labour government also built the Post Office Tower, even though it is now just a hazard to aircraft.Then there’s Concorde. The world did not need such a thing.And the technical challenges facing the engineers were huge. A Nasa boffin once told me that getting a passenger plane up beyond Mach  was more dficult than putting a man on the moon.But that old commie Tony Benn had decided Concorde was going to succeed, so he pushed and he pushed and, by God, are we glad he did.Can you imagine such a thing Because even though the beautul white bird is now grounded, we still have those memories of the shattering noise it made and the way it could make the sun rise in the West.I remember once, standing on a beach in Barbados as a British Airways Concorde roared overhead at treetop height.After it had passed, a stunned American on the next sun lounger looked at me and said: “You Brits.”I was so proud, I didn’t get round to telling him it was half French.Since Concorde though, Britain hasn’t really done anything of any great importance. There’s been talk of a new railway line from London to Manchester, but in evolutionary terms that’s just a shuffle. And now it probably won’t happen anyway.Which is why I am SO excited about the idea of a bridge linking Larne, in Northern Ireland with Portpatrick, in Scotland.Weirdly, the Labour Party — the party that created the Post Office Tower and Concorde and the Humber Bridge — are furious, saying it’s not needed and will be too expensive and it’s only been suggested to get Boris out of his backstop hole.But can you imagine such a thing A -mile bridge supported on columns ,ft high, and rising even higher in the middle so ships can pass underneath. It would be magnicent.Yes, it would be dficult to make.

It was “furious rabies” which causes extreme thirst and a morbid fear of water. At the same time.Mercully, he has now died. And we, meanwhile, are left to ponder what sort of a God comes up with a disease like that to end nearly , lives every year.ON the basis you should know your enemy, I read a book on holiday this year about why we shouldn’t kill animals.It wasn’t called – “If you eat meat, you’re a bastard”, but that was the thrust.And after a while, I deliberately left it in the rain, so I didn’t have to finish it.However, since I ed to Britain about a month ago, I still haven’t been able to eat pork.Cows  Chickens  Sheep  Not really bothered.But some of the things I read in that book about how pigs can play video games and feel love – they stuck.And so did the bit about how frightened they look when they are being taken to the slaughterhouse.I tried this morning to have a bacon sandwich but I couldn’t bring myself to put it in my mouth.It’s annoying. Pork was always my favourite meat but I’ll have to find a substitute.I’m thinking badger.

Second, it must protect the integrity of the EU’s single market. Third, it must not involve any checks on the island of Ireland.Barclay said the UK could meet the first two of these tests, but not the third. He said there was no point in presenting any detailed proposals until the EU shted on the question of checks.One Government source explains thatthe UK did, the “EU would nuke the proposals and we would be in chaos”.So the challenge for Boris is to get the EU to move on this third point. His Monday meeting with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gives him a chance to lobby him on this very issue.Juncker is an instinctive deal-maker and, with his term as president due to end on October , he will be keen to resolve Brexit before he goes.I also understand that several EU governments, including in France, are now apprehensive about the possibility of a second referendum.They believe it would be bad for the EU for the UK to stay in given how contested UK membership now is.They fear this would lead to every Council decision, all new EU legislation and every European Court of Justice judgment becoming a matter of controversy.The EU, though, will not abandon Ireland. This means that whatever proposal Boris comes up with will have to be something Leo Varadkar is prepared to swallow.The first meeting between the two men has given Downing Street some hope that they can find something that works for Dublin, them and the DUP.The DUP’s willingness to entertain Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on agriculture has opened the door to further discussions.If Parliament had not tied Boris’s hands, he could have seenthe risk of No Deal would have pushed Dublin and the EU to compromise on the checks front. But his ability to negotiate is now weakened.For this and other reasons, the odds are still against a deal. But there is a greater chance of one than a week ago.The Liberal Democrats start their conference today in their strongest position for years.They are polling around  per cent and in line to make major gains at the next election.At conference next week they are expected to adopt as their position that a Lib Dem government – stop laughing at the back – would simply revoke Article , cancelling the referendum result.This will establish them as the most unambiguously anti-Brexit party, a development that concerns a growing number of Labour MPs in Remain seats who want their party to take a clearer line on the issue for fear of losing ground to the Lib Dems.At the same time, the policy means that the Liberal Democrats can tell voters they will make the whole issue go away. By contrast, a second referendum would drag things out.If politics is now about Leave v Remain, rather than Left v Right, expect the Lib Dems to come back with more MPs than they have ever had before, following the next election.One of the things that urgently needs sorting out in this country is technical education.Those who don’t want to do an academic degree are being ill-served by further education.Gavin Williamson, the new Education Secretary, told Cabinet this week that there are up to , people trained in Hair  Beauty yet only a need for about , new recruits to work in this industry each year.The result is tens of thousands of people doing courses that don’t lead to them getting jobs or boost this country’s productivity.Those who want a second Brexit referendum are now arguing there shouldn’t be a General Election until a second referendum has taken place.Tony Blair, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson and Tory rebel Oliver Letwin have all made that case this week.Leave aside the massive issue of whether there should be a second referendum before the result of the first one has even been implemented, this plan would mean that this Parliament would have to carry on sitting until well into .This is a disastrous idea. This is a useless Parliament and keeping it going will just add to the national paralysis.With no party able to command a majority in the Commons, nothing can get done. Eventhis Parliament could muster a majority for a referendum, which is far from certain, it could do so for little .It is hard to see what meaningful domestic legislation can come out of this Parliament given that neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn can secure the backing of most MPs.The public desire for politicians to get on with both Brexit and the domestic agenda is why No will spend next week trying to emphasise its tough-on-crime policies.I understand Boris Johnson will put flesh on the bones of his plan to end early release for violent and unrepentant criminals.Friends are urging Amber Rudd to stand in the West London seat of Kensington at the next election.Its controversial Labour MP, Emma Dent Coad, has a majority of just .The thinking goes that the constituency isn’t keen on either No Deal or Jeremy Corbyn, so Rudd could do well standing as an independent.But it is exceptionally hard for independents to win seats, andRudd were to go down this course, she would be standing in the constituency for the first time – she is currently MP for Hastings, down on the south coast. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Domestic violence charities have been appalled by the decision to give cricket legend Boycott, , a knighthood.It was awarded to the former England captain in Theresa May ’s resignation honours list.   A French judge who convicted Boycott said she stands by the guilty verdict. The Yorkshireman was convicted in  of assaulting Ms Moore in a hotel in France two years previously. She was left with black eyes. A court was told he hit her  times. The retired judge, Dominique Haumant, who said Boycott’s conduct in court was “arrogant” and “deplorable”, added: “I cannot believe he’s being received by the Queen. “I’m told she will take a sword and anoint him on each shoulder.

The former PM’s drug use is revealed in a bombshell interview to plug his new book.He accuses Boris Johnson of switching to back Leave for personal ambition and brands ex-pal Michael Gove “mendacious”.After skulking away over his ­referendum defeat, Mr Cameron has emerged from the chaos he helped create to stick the kne into Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.The former PM accused the current leader of only supporting Leave for personal ambition, as he bids to be a Brexit martyr by trying to crash Britain out of the EU without a deal.   And self-pitying Mr Cameron branded his ex-friend Michael Gove “mendacious” for betraying him after the referendum humiliation in , which ended his days as PM. The former public schoolboy also admitted getting “off his head” on dope at Eton and smoking it again later with we Samantha and her friends. His confession came in a bombshell interview with The Times to plug his ­autobiography, For The Record, which is published next Thursday Mr Cameron also told how the Leave campaign’s Brexit victory left him depressed – but there was no apology for the mayhem his decision to hold a ­isive referendum has since caused.    In the book he accuses Mr Johnson and Mr Gove of behaving “appallingly” as the Brexit campaign became “this terrible Tory psychodrama”. He whined: “I thought there were places Conservatives wouldn’t go against each other. Quagmire “I say in the book, Boris had never argued for leaving the EU, right  “Michael was a strong ­Eurosceptic, but someone whom I’d known as this liberal, compassionate, rational Conservative ended up making arguments about Turkey [joining the EU] and being swamped and what have you. “They were trashing the Government of which they were a part, effectively. “I felt like I was in a sort of quagmire by the end.”    Mr Cameron claims as the  battle geared up, Mr Johnson believed Leave would be defeated. He said: “Boris thought he was going to lose. “When he made the decision to back Leave he said, ‘Brexit will be crushed.’ ” Talking of Mr Johnson’s ambition, he added: “I think he was genuinely torn, but I came to the conclusion in the end that it was too tempting not to run that campaign and go that way.” As revealed in yesterday’s Mirror, Mr Gove bears the brunt of Mr Cameron’s unprecedented attack. He even branded the former ­Education Secretary a “w****r” over his reluctance to change jobs in a reshuffle. Mr Cameron had decided to demote Gove to Chief Whip after years of rocky relations with teachers. But when he refused to budge, Cameron said, he text him: “You are either a team player or a w****r.” In the interview, Mr Cameron complained he was “miserable about giving up the job I loved and working for the country I loved”. He said he was “hugely depressed about it”. But he still refused to accept ­responsibility for unleashing the chaos and paving the way for the current crisis in which the country is mired.  Mr Cameron, who insisted he is not in favour of no-deal, said: “Every single day I think about it, the ­referendum and the fact that we lost and the consequences and the things that could have been done dferently, and I worry desperately about what is going to happen next. “I think we can get to a situation where we leave but we are friends, neighbours and partners. We can get there, but I would love to fast-forward to that moment because it’s painful for the country and it’s painful to watch.” Pointing to “all those people who wanted a referendum”, he accepted many would never forgive him for ordering an In-Out vote. But he admitted to being accosted in the street by angry electors furious at what has unfolded.  Mr Cameron said: “You get lots of dferent reactions. “What I tried to do in the book was explain why I felt this was inevitable.” The multi-millionaire claimed he worries “desperately about what is going to happen next”. He also accepted a second Brexit referendum could be on the cards. Mr Cameron added: “I don’t think you can rule it out because we’re stuck.” As PM, he held three ­referendums in five years – a  poll on electoral reform, a  Scottish independence ballot and Brexit. Speaking about his personal relationship with Mr Johnson, Mr Cameron said: “We’ve had issues. “Even before Brexit there were tensions and ­disagreements but, on the whole, we’ve got on well.” He also laid into Mr Johnson for axing  Tory rebels who voted against his no-deal bid and for suspending Parliament to avoid ­scrutiny over his plans. He said: “Taking the whip from MPs and sharp practices using prorogation of Parliament have rebounded. I didn’t support either of those things.”Mr Cameron said he contacted his successor Theresa May as she ­negotiated with Brussels while boxed in by her self-imposed red lines on the withdrawal agreement.He added: “I remember frequently texting her about the frustration of getting a Brexit deal and then seeing Brexiteers vote it down possibly at the risk of the whole project they had devoted themselves to. Maddening. And infuriating. There’s an argument that Brexit is just impossible to deliver and no one could have done, and there’s an argument that, well, wrong choices were made.” As Mr Cameron prepares for his book launch, Mr Johnson was askedhe was worried about what would be written about him in it. The PM, who branded Mr Cameron a “girly swot” in leaked papers, replied: “Absolutely nothing that David Cameron says in his memoirs will diminish the affection and respect in which I hold him.” Cameron on Gove Michael Gove is branded a liar by Mr Cameron and described as “mendacious” over things he said during the referendum campaign. He said: “I think what I say is that over the issue of whether or not we had a veto over Turkey, and over the issue of the £million on the bus, I think they left the truth at home.” Askedthe pair are still speaking, Mr Cameron said: “We’ve spoken. Not a huge amount. I’ve sort of had a conversation with him. I’ve spoken to the Prime Minister a little bit, but Michael was a very good friend. So that has been more dficult.”  aposIssuesapos with Boris David Cameron has spoken candidly about his relationship with Boris Johnson. The former Prime Minister said of the current Premier: “We’ve had issues.” He paints a damning picture of Mr Johnson as someone who would arrive late at vital emergency COBRA meetings. Mr Cameron also explained how he tried to pe rsuade his friend to back Remain by suggesting he was likely to succeed him in No . He also offered him a top-five Cabinet job – hinting at the position of Defence Secretary.

Detective Inspector Jess Milne, said: “The piece of art that has been stolen is a high value toilet made out of gold that was on display at the palace. “Due to the toilet being plumbed in to the building, this has caused signicant damage and flooding. “We believe a group offenders used at least two vehicles during the offence. “The artwork has not been recovered at this time but we are conducting a thorough investigation to find it and bring those responsible to justice.  “Residents will see an increased police presence in the area while officers and staff carry out enquiries. “I am appealing to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area to contact police. “You can call us on , quoting URN  , visit our website or visit a police station.” In a press conference at around .pm today Inspector Richard Nicholls said he could not confirm how the group got onto the premises.

We knew there was huge interest in the Maurizio Cattelan contemporary art exhibition, with many set to come and enjoy the installations. I t’s therefore a great shame an item so precious has been taken, but we still have so many fascinating treasures in the Palace and the remaining items of the exhibition to share.

The mum-to-three added: When I started posting about it and raising awareness, I lost all of my friendships - because they were telling me to be quiet about it. Ryan, who is a teaching assistant, said: There is nothing in schools now to teach kids where their food comes from, how it is slaughtered and the process and all of that kind of stuff. So for me, posting was the most powerful thing I could do, I could get things out on social media for people to see and read.I got grief from friends back in the Midlands, where I grew up, saying this is not what Facebook is about, stop with the dead images of animals and share family photos instead.   Trolls even went as far to tell Ryan he was disrespecting the memory of his father, who was a butcher, and the couple havenapost spoken to Jacquiaposs sister in over a year, who she used to be really close to.

Top tips by Clare Francis, Savings and Investment Director at Barclays. Balance eating out with staying in Dining out regularly adds up and restaurant meals are much more expensive than those you would cook for yourself. View dining out as a treat and make sure that you budget for these special occasions accordingly. Cook in Batches When preparing your meals, bigger is definitely better as by cooking in batches you’ll not only save yourself money, but also the hassle of preparing inidual meals each day! If you are out and about, why not prepare yourself some healthy snacks to take with you such as protein balls or raw chocolate bars.DIY Vegan staples such as almond milks and cashew butters can all be made at home for a fraction of the price. While it will require more time and effort, the savings you will make in the long-term will make it even more worth it and making them in batches will help you get more for your money. Buy in Season Fruit and vegetables are key components of a vegan diet, but buying fresh produce out of season can put a huge dent in your bank balance. Try to avoid the mark up by keeping your shopping list seasonal, or you look in the freezer aisle to seeyou can favourite products any time of the year. Plan before you head out to the shops Try planning your food shopping for the week ahead, this will make sure that you only buy what you need for meals, rather than spending money on items that might go unused. Shopping on a full stomach also helps you make better decisions and stick to budget. If you have time, why not do some research into which stores near you stock your essentials at the cheapest price. Buy in bulk Purchasing products in bulk is a great way to save money, especiallyyou regularly cook for family and friends. Often you will find that the larger packages are cheaper by weight and you won’t need to buy them as often! Look out for the unit price on packaging. This will tell you the exact cost per gram, litre etc, which makes it easy to compare between products and choose the cheapest option. Grow whatever, wherever you can Fresh produce can be expensive, especiallyyou are regularly picking up herbs. Why not create your own vegetable patch or grow your basil and coriander on your windowsill – just don’t forget to water them!   My friends are supportive but people do view vegans as wanting to take down farmers, and I understand it because farmers are their families. Ryan, , admitted it was more dficult for him to make the change. The father, who grew up surrounded by the farming industry and was a frequent visitor to slaughterhouses, said: Dad was a highly respected farmer and neighbours would bring animals around to be skinned and plucked. So it wasnapost abnormal for me to be around dead animals for much of my le. I would help put animals on trailers and get the animals into the slaughterhouses and it was all normal to me. I witnessed chickens being killed on the farm, I worked on the turkey line just before Christmas and I always just thought aposwe need animals to be healthy and strongapos. But after Jacquiaposs mother was diagnosed with bowel cancer and Ryanaposs father passed away, the teaching assistant decided to change his diet.

British-Australian Kylie Moore-Gilbert is the third person named by the Australian Government this week to be in detention in prison in Iran. The Cambridge-educated academic who is now a lecturer in Islamic Studies at Melbourne University, has been in Tehranaposs notorious Evin prison for almost a year, having reportedly been given a -year sentence. She has published work on the  Arab uprisings and on authoritarian governments. Her case came to light this week along with those of another British-Australian woman, Jolie King, and her Australian boyfriend Mark Firkin, who have been held for the past  weeks in an unrelated incident. The Australian Government has said it is lobbying Tehran to ensure all three are appropriately cared for. The University of Melbourneaposs website lists Dr Moore-Gilbert on its Find an expert page as a lecturer at the universityaposs Asia Institute.    It says she specialises in Middle Eastern politics, with a particular focus on the Arab Gulf states, and that she had published work on the  Arab uprisings, authoritarian governance, and on the role of new media technologies in political activism. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Saturday released a statement from Dr Moore-Gilbertaposs family, which said: We have been and continue to be in close contact with the Australian Government. Our family thanks the Government and the University of Melbourne for their ongoing support at this distressing and sensitive time. We believe that the best chance of securing Kylieaposs safeis through diplomatic channels. We will not be making any further comment and would like to request that our privacy - and that of our wider family and friends - is respected at this time. Although Iranian authorities have not made public the charges against Dr Moore-Gilbert, -year sentences have regularly been dealt in the country to those convicted of spying. While news of the trioaposs incarcerations only surfaced this week, Australiaaposs Foreign Minister Marise Payne says she has raised their cases many times with her Iranian counterpart Javad Zar. And Senator Payne has denied the arrests were politically motivated, although some reports have speculated the trio are being held in hope of giving Iran political leverage on a number of ongoing disputes with the western countries. We have no reason to think that these arrests are connected to international concern over Iranaposs nuclear programme, United Nations sanction enforcement or maritime security concerning the safety of civilian shipping, Senator Payne said.

And it comes as Joeaposs sister, Holly, has successfully managed to source a le-saving defibrillator to be kept at her womanaposs football club stadium in Toxteth. Holly, , a teaching assistant in a special needs school, said: We were all starting to worry and around midnight we got a phone call to say that he had been found collapsed and taken to hospital where he passed away. “Joe had been diagnosed with a bicuspid aortic valve which has no symptoms and was totally undetected. “Had a defibrillator been nearby, Joe could have still been here with us now and received treatment.” The -year-old was a regular at his gym and had no known illnesses. His sister added: Joe was a popular lad, he loved to socialise, getting the mums up to dance, and loved his holidays and his designer clothes. After he died, we had people coming to the house, who had met him just once, telling us how they he had touched their lives. Joe was a young, fit man who had his whole le in front of him.

It’s shown the tough time many communities are having. But it’s told stories of wonderful people too. Hardworking, honest people with pride in their home towns – despite today’s problems. They give me hope for the future. But they desperately need a new deal. Many of these towns were once powerhouses of industry. They made Britain a wealthy nation and offered good working-class jobs you could build a le on. But when those industries closed, the jobs that replaced them were low-paid and insecure.  Then after the financial crisis, communities that were already down took another a kicking from a decade of austerity.It’s time to do right by our towns again. They need decent, solid jobs and world-class public services.We want to hear stories from your town. What do you think about it  Are you facing any issues  Email webnews@mirror or call       There’s an election coming, so my message to all the parties is this. Firstly, invest in our towns to attract good employers and create decent jobs. That means modern transport links and new centres of green industry across the UK. We can win the battle against climate change and create great new jobs while we’re at it. And we need a National Investment Bank to target investment to towns where good jobs are in short supply.Secondly, the next government must rebuild public services.  Austerity has done deep harm to Britain. And the worst damage is to towns that were already struggling.Every town needs good schools and hospitals, safe neighbourhoods and truly affordable homes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email When Nicola Owst found a Staffordshire bull terrier abandoned and close to death she didn’t think twice about saving him. But what she didn’t know then was that her new buddy would save her too – by freeing her from her past. The brave dog would also go on to become a social media star and capture the hearts of dog lovers everywhere. Here, in an extract from her new book, Saving Buddy, Nicola shares their story of survival, hope and love.His poor sad eyes were just slits in his bony, bruised face and just trying to keep them open was causing him intense pain. The skin around his filthy, swollen muzzle was pockmarked and livid pink where his fur had worn away. Blood under his right eye had soaked down his face and neck and on to his body, and his skeletal bird-like legs showed every sinew.  He was barely alive and every movement was agonising for him. It was April  and I’d travelled from Leicestershire with my stable-owner friend, Sally, and her daughter, Charlie, to collect two unwanted foals from a couple of shady-looking men in a junkyard just outside London. We’d just finished loading the horse-box when Charlie spotted a dog wedged into a cat carrier, inside a rusty crate. He was barely breathing – clinging on to le. So I freed the cat box and carefully lted him out of his prison. He was some kind of staffy and his terribly scared face showed he’d endured the most dreadful mistreatment. Had he been in illegal dog fights  He’d been left to die in his own waste. The stench of rotting flesh and faeces was unbelievable. His paw pads were red raw from standing in his own urine. What sort of monster could leave an animal is such a state  When I lted his limp body on to my lap, his legs buckled beneath him. I gently swaddled him in a towel. “I’ve got you now, buddy,” I whispered to him. And from that moment on he was known as Buddy.  We set off home but I feared he might not survive the journey and kept saying “Hang in there, Buddy.” We drove straight to the vet who took one look at Buddy and shook his head. It was the worst case of neglect he’d ever seen. Buddy was riddled with demodectic mange. The infection had eaten his skin and his weakened immune system meant he couldn’t fight it. The next  hours would be critical. Armed with antibiotics and a treatment for his skin, we went home. I half-filled the kitchen sink with water, added anti-bacterial shampoo and lowered Buddy in. I gently bathed away the foul dirt and grime as he sat there, placidly. Bit by bit, his lovely, splodgy brown and black brindle markings became clearer, and the real Buddy started to be revealed. This was possibly the first tender care he’d ever been given. I talked to him the whole time, telling him what a brave boy he was. It broke my heart to think about how scared he must have been, abandoned in that crate to die. Once he was clean, I wrapped him up in a big fluffy towel and patted him dry. I then cooked him some mini-fillets of chicken and a sachet of rice. I knewhe ate something, he would stand a better chance of making it through the night. Next morning Buddy seemed perkier. He tried to stand and walk towards me like a wobbly Bambi, but his back legs were too weak and his paws were agony. I went to Asda and bought some baby socks, padded the soles with cotton wool to cushion his paw pads and kept them on with sticky tape. The next time he wobbled on to his feet, he stayed upright for a few more seconds. It was a step in the right direction. And I did some research on Staffordshire bull terriers and was reassured to read they’re a lot softer than their fearsome reputation suggests.    I was going through a break-up at the time and, looking back, it feels asBuddy was sent to give me new focus. I needed help too. I felt very raw and vulnerable, unwanted and rejected. The moment Buddy looked at me with those pleading eyes, I knew he wanted me as much as I wanted him. By healing him, I was healing myself of heartache. I rescued Buddy that day but he also rescued me. Day by day he grew stronger and started to put on weight, but it was a long process. The raw, pink boy I’d rescued started to sport a summer coat. As I massaged his velvet-soft ears, he’d close his eyes in pleasure and wag his tail. I didn’t feel alone as I was so unconditionally loved by my little ball of energy. I had spent so long with loser boyfriends and shed too many tears when relationships had failed. But now I had a fantastic companion who’d be there for me through thick and thin. I was a manager at a job centre and in July  we got some new recruits. We were a similar age and got on well and would all go out for a drink. One of them, Jon Owst, was really nice and I enjoyed chatting to him. He was tall with dark hair, lovely blue eyes and a kind way – eager to hear all about my twin passions: Buddy and horses. We became friends and, six months later, Jon asked me on a date. It was lovely, but I’d gone on about Buddy so much Jon could be in no doubt it was a case of love me, love my dog. To my surprise he asked me out again and we took Buddy to the park. It was a fantastic day – the start of something special. Jon was a breath of fresh air and quickly became a new dad to Buddy. It made me realise how self-centred my recent ex-boyfriend had been. Buddy made me realise le is too short to be with someone who only cared about themselves. In August  Jon popped the question and presented me with a beautul ring. I said yes, straight away. We got married on Easter Sunday, . Our wedding was perfect. Buddy had a gorgeous garland of flowers in the coral wedding colours and he starred in many of the wedding photos.    But two years later I was cuddling Buddy and noticed a hard swelling on his back left ankle – the size of a large broad bean. The vet didn’t think it looked sinister. But I had a niggling feeling it was serious and Jon insisted I take Buddy back to the vet. He sent Buddy for an X-ray and “to have some cells tested.” I went into panic, worrying Buddy had cancer. Five days after the tests the vet rang. And the only word I heard was “tumour”. I couldn’t bear it, not after everything we’d been through, after his terrible start in le. Jon hugged me and tried to put my mind at rest. We went to the surgery. The vet said the tumour was in an awkward place and Buddy needed an specialist. Whatthe cancer had spread into Buddy’s leg. Would it mean amputation to save his le  The op went well. But the surgeon wasn’t % certain he’d removed all of the tumour. Buddy had to have radiotherapy and eight doses of chemotherapy. But how were we going to pay for it  I’d got pet insurance after rescuing Buddy, but with cancer costs rocket and there was very little in the pot.   I was desperately worried. We hadn’t been in our new house long and had no savings. But I’d created a Facebook page called Buddy Dog – The Rescue Staffy, to spread the word that staffies are lovely dogs.I posted about his treatment and the more I shared, the more Buddy’s friends increased.Friends suggested I set up a GoFundMe page to raise funds towards the treatment. And, amazingly, within weeks, we had raised the £ needed. When Buddy had his final round of chemo it was such a relief. It looked as though he would again be the incredible personality we knew and loved. But during Buddy’s cancer scare, we found out I was expecting. I had terrible morning sickness and Buddy knew there was something wrong with me. He’d sit next to me with his head tilted, a worried frown on his face. And I told him everything – as I always had. But eight weeks into the pregnancy, I woke up and sensed something was wrong. I turned to Jon and said: “I think the baby’s gone.” A scan confirmed it two days later, I had an operation to have the pregnancy removed. I was terribly upset but knew it wasn’t uncommon. A few months later I was pregnant for a second time – but miscarried again early on. When it happened a third time I was utterly devastated. Surely there must be something wrong with me  But the gt of morning sickness was delivered again, in the autumn of .

And this week she was centre stage again as she and William took Charlotte, four, for her first day at Thomas’s Battersea, in London. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are regulars at the school and have often done the school run for six-year-old Prince George, who started there in .  But despite the appearance making papers across the country apparently parents at the school are not quite so fussed about the royal couple. One parent there is actually another mother who people find a lot more interesting than Kate and William, especially the dads.Speaking after Prince George started at Thomasaposs Battersea last year, the parent told the Daily Mail : “No one really gives Kate a second glance when she does the school drop-off. “We have a Victoria’s Secret model doing the school run, too, and the dads are far more interested in her!” Unfortunately, the chatty parent did not reveal the name of the beauty who frequents the school gates.

You can only find love motels like this one in Latin America and Asia.    But the urban explorer has not revealed the precise location of the old hotel in fear of vandalism.

It’s harder for the defence when you move it quickly from side to side because there will be a gap in the defence some time.“As well as moving it quicker, you have to be patient to wait for that gap to appear.”Marshall was given a break by manager James McPake for the - Challenge Cup defeat to Elgin City last Sunday and is keen to get back on the pitch come tomorrow.“I wasn’t playing on Sunday, the gaffer said I could head home and see some family and get a rest, but when I came back the feeling was positive around the place, to be honest,” he added.“I don’t think we need to dwell too much on it. We’ve had a couple of bad results but it’s happened, it’s over and it’s about putting it right tomorrow.“If you look over the whole start to the season, it’s been a decent start.“The derby was obviously a night to forget but we have three more derbies this season and we’ll be looking to put that right later on in the season.”On being rested, he added: “I want to be playing every week but we have a good squad with two good players for every position. The gaffer needed to see Sean Mackie play as well so, fair enough, I respect his decision.“It’s always good to have a bit of competition.”Dundee picked up six clean sheets in their opening eight matches of the season and rediscovering that will be key to getting back to form, says Marshall.Their inability to deal with set-pieces at Tannadice, too, took the left-back by surprise two weeks ago and the former Queen of the South man revealed improving that has been a key part of training lately.He added: “We’d kept a few clean sheets already this season and then conceding six was unacceptable, particularly at this club.“We need to get back to being solid and doing the basics right like we were doing when we were picking up so many clean sheets. We’ve been working on our set-pieces.“Usually we’ve been pretty solid from them this season. We need to put that right because we can’t defend like that.”And Alloa in the past have used their threat at set-plays to pick up some vital results in the Championship.Marshall added: “I haven’t seen much of Alloa this year but last season they were always organised and they scored from a few set-pieces against me when I was at Queens.“They are also a good footballing side and I’ve heard they are playing out from the back this season so they’ll probably come here and try to play football as well.“They are a part-time team but they were brilliant last year.

He gets them working for each other and they get good energy in their team. They’ll be a force this year.”On top of that, Robbie admires the way the man who had a troubled spell at Tannadice more than a decade ago has resurrected his managerial career.He added: “As all managers know, we go up and down. We have good periods, then we have dficult periods.“I’ve had that as well and it’s about resilience. Ian’s had that and he’s shown it. He’s gone to a club and shown what capabilities he’s got.“He’s built something at Ayr and it’s like anything, it’s about getting time.“If you get three or four years, you get the chance to build something and get stability.“The problem in the game now is that you are getting two or three months. Ian’s managed to get time down there and, hopefully, I get that here because it gives you the chance to make a football club.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d7b472adbd355.69813056.jpg ","title":"new 1m digital playground designs get thumbs up from people of dundee","story":"New images of the million pound “digital playground” have been given the thumbs-up from the people of Dundee.Dundee City Council has issued a call for applicants to design and deliver the interactive play park at Waterfront Place, to the east of VA Dundee.Taking pitches until early October, the council wants all designs to match its initial brief of a nautical play area inspired by whales and whale song.The local authority has set aside between £, and £m to cover design and construction, with an aim of completing the entire Waterfront Place project by March .And it has attracted praise from locals and visitors alike after pictures were published this week.Valerie Clark, formerly of Dundee but who now stays in Guildford said: “I think it’s a lovely idea to pay homage to Dundee’s whaling history.“It will keep the area open and will stop it being covered by buildings.”Elanor Brown, from Edinburgh, said: “I think it’s a really nice design. It will fit in well with all of the regeneration that has taken place at the waterfront.#But Ashley Squire, from Coldside, insisted there were other issues that also had to be ironed out, saying: “It’s a nice design but there are issues with parking at the Waterfront.“Perhaps they could revise the design to include more parking spaces for families wishing to use the playground.”Council officers say they have only “very high” aspirations for the design and features of the play park, which is expected to have large numbers of visitors due to its proximity to the VA.In a design brief published as part of the bidding process, they express the hope that the facility will be “unique and very memorable”, with interactive elements such as keypads, buttons and features triggered by sensors.#Planners also want to see it illuminated at night, like the VA and the adjacent Discovery. “The intention for the play area is that it should be innovative in design, and ambitious in its unique identity,” they said.“There are fundamental starting points for the designers involved: that it is to be themed on whales, and that a digital element should be included.“The play area needs to be suitable for all ages and needs.”The council is leaning heavily on Dundee’s historical whaling trade as inspiration for the play area. As well as specying that the play area should be the shape of a whale it also wants kids to be able to create whale song.Officers have even alluded to the bowhead whale – the preferred whale of the one-time Dundee whaler – as the ideal inspiration for any design.Following the construction and opening of the park, the council aims to form a Whale Park Engagement Group with experts from Dundee Science Centre and the University of St Andrews to promote sustainable marine practices.The launch of the design competition comes after Andy Scott, creator of the Kelpies sculptures in Falkirk, scrapped a plan for a whale sculpture in Waterfront Place.Much like the play area, Mr Scott’s steel design would have been le-sized, inspired by the bowhead whale, and built as a tribute to the whaling trade.However, the Scottish sculptor had to let his design – which he drew up at no cost to the council – “swim off into the sunset” after agents acting for the local authority ignored his pitch."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-2-e1553252194766-940x564.jpg ","title":"shankland starring but appere not far behind says dundee uniteds mcmullan","story":"Ten goals in just nine appearances so far for Dundee United means the hype surrounding striker Lawrence Shankland is both understandable and fair.And it’s meant him picking up the Player-of-the-Month award for August has to go down as one of the easiest decisions the judging  has ever had to make.So far as winger Paul McMullan is concerned every plaudit that’s come his new team-mate’s way has been thoroughly well deserved.Butthere is an injustice surrounding the Tangerines’ blistering start to the league season, McMullan feels it might just be the lack of recognition for Shankland’s fellow-striker Louis Appere.Because he feels since breaking into the first team at the start of the campaign, the -year-old has also had a massive impact.“Louis has been brilliant. He came in for pre-season looking sharp and really fit and he’s carried that right through into the league campaign,” said McMullan.“He’s been really good but that’s probably gone under the radar a wee bit with Shanks scoring however many goals he has, but Louis has been great.“I’m sure Shanks will say the same thing because Louis has been really good for him and they seem to work together very well.“It’s made things a bit more dficult for defences because there is two of them up there to worry about and that’s good for us.“The two of them complement each other very well and that’s what you want from your strikers. It’s good for the team.”As they look to continue what’s been a perfect start in the Championship with, four wins from four outings so far, tomorrow sees United head for Ayr United and potentially one of their toughest tests to date.McMullan is well aware last season Somerset Park was not a happy hunting ground.It saw United suffer two defeats that were signicant blows to their automatic promotion challenge.While he is determined to take three points this time, he expects to have to work hard for them.“They were dficult to play against last year and it will be the same again,” McMullan added.“They are direct and make the game really physical. You don’t really get a minute on the ball.“So you have to be ready to go against them andyou are not at it % then you will get beat.”Of course, one big plus this time round is that man Shankland being in tangerine instead of black and white.McMullan’s viewing that as a double bonus.“I think he scored six goals against us so it will be great that he is not up against us this time.“Having him in your team is brilliant. You just need to get it into the vicinity of the -yard box and the ball usually hits him and then goes in!”For the Terrors, the main priority is another win to keep the early season momentum going.While he admits his preference would have been for the league games to be coming thick and fast right now, he’s not too concerned about last week’s break for the Challenge Cup possibly interrupting the team’s flow.“The cup has kind of broken it up a bit for us. It was a bit inconvenient, to be honest, and it’s not the greatest cup as it is.“It kind of broke up our momentum but we are determined to pick up where we left off after the derby against Dundee.”“The positive side of the couple of breaks we’ve had since the league started is that they can give time for boys who’ve picked up knocks to recover properly and we’ll all be feeling fresh for this game.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/KMil_Bee-005-846x564.jpg ","title":"the first thing i did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water dundee man turns his life around with the help of community group","story":"“The first thing I did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water,” said Ian Thomas, speaking of his -year alcohol addiction.“I’d have a few of those for my breakfast.“I would wake up and vomit, have diarrhoea.“I was delirious, tremors, no appetite. I was drinking to knock myself out.”Ian, , of Earn Crescent, said his le was so low he had suicidal thoughts of slitting his wrists and jumping off the Tay Road Bridge.He said: “I kept a diary. I wrote in it every day the amount of times I was sick, bleeding, diarrhoea, then wrote that I just wanted to go to sleep and not wake up.”Ian desperately wanted out of the le of alcoholism but he did not know how he could escape it without dying.He said: “I was hospitalised dozens of times.“I wasn’t the master of my le anymore, alcohol was the master of me, everything I did revolved around it.“I lived in a slum.“There was blood everywhere, spewing everywhere, mouldy drink cans, pee all over the place – I knew it was a slum but I didn’t care.”It got so bad that Ian could not walk or talk and was checked into former psychiatric hospital Sunnyside in Montrose three times for detoxication by his family.But it was only following the third time Ian made the conscious decision to stay sober – a feat he’s managed for  years now.He said: “I’m not proud of myself.“I don’t look at the past, I just take each day at a time.“I tell myself I’m sober today and the rest slowly takes care of itself.”Ian now keeps himself busy with activities such as drawing and creative projects at Just Bee Productions.The community group offers people a safe space to be creative and connect with others at vulnerable times in their lives.Ian said: “Getting involved with Just Bee is one of the best things that’s ever happened to me.“It keeps my mind busy and gives me something positive to focus on and it’s good to be around people again, instead of sitting in the house on my own all day with just my thoughts.”Ian and about  other participants in the group are gearing up to start working on a musical theatre show called This is a Mental Musical.Claire Bee, founder of Just Bee Productions, said: “The show is about mental health and everything that goes along with that.“It’s also about giving people a  to have a voice to say what they want to say.”The show will be performed in Dundee and the group hopes to take it to Edinburgh Fringe Festival next year.Former plays performed by Just Bee include Drink, The Musical which toured community venues in Dundee, including nearby prisons, and another musical called Next Stop Please.Former heroin addict Cheryl Ferguson, , said: “Doing the musicals has helped to build up my confidence, self worth and a feeling that I belong.“It’s opened up opportunities which I wouldn’t have thought were possible and I’ve met loads of brilliant people who are like family now.“I love it. No drugs can give that sort of feeling.“The first time I did it, I came off stage and felt brilliant and it wasn’t brought on by any substance.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-old-photos-show-royal-visit-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times"},{"url":null,"title":"nominate-glasgow-community-champions-sep-17","story":"IN EVERY corner of Glasgow, there are terric teachers, top cops, fabulous firefighters and marvellous medical staff working tirelessly to support the people of this city."},{"url":null,"title":"football-fans-give-views-kris-boyd-39-s-39-middle-class-39-sport-jibes","story":"OUR article in Tuesdayrsquos Evening Times on former Scotland and Rangers striker Kris Boyd branding football a middle-class sport in Scotland after the national sidersquos latest defeat sparked many comments.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"an album with atmosphere and depth","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowExtract of an album review by Marc HigginsThis striking album is a collaboration between singer songwriter Sheila K Cameron and John Saich and Mags Russell of Argyll#s Wild Biscuit productions.In  they collaborated on an album called More Like a River than a Road. These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment. Lewis, aged only four, conveyed a powerful symbolism for apples that morning.The apple falling from the tree in front of Isaac Newton was a symbol of scientic discovery. For my son, an apple is a symbol of love. And my son loves the apples he eats, and the ones which walk with him.

Only after persistently sitting the exam  times ndash and being rejected many of those times because she was a woman ndash did she become a chief engineer. Born at Megginch Castle, Perthshire, the god-daughter of Queen Victoria, she was from an early age interested in mechanics. Inspired by the machinery in the Robert Morton and Sons engineering works near her home, in , at the age of , she did an apprenticeship at the Northern Garage Perth.

John Knox:Religious revolutionaryand educationalistJohn Knox was a pillar of the reformation. It was said by one English ambassador that to hear him preach was like was ldquohaving  trumpets blowing in onersquos ear. The sound of those trumpets still reverberates. We live in a Scotland in which that Presbyterian sensibility lingers, in which we, in spite of religious ersity and the waning of the Church of Scotland, are frequently caricatured as a Calvinist nation. Knox, a former Roman Catholic priest from Haddington, went on to become a firebrand prophet, railing against idolatry. His journey towards bringing the Protestant revolution to Scotland involved a period as slave in the French kingrsquos galleys and time in Geneva where he came under the instruction of John Calvin. His legacy, however, is more than the established Church of Scotland. It was an education system and the idea of universal schooling, as well as new ways of providing for the poor.He was also, many believe, a key influence in the American revolution. A black mark lingers against him for his misogynist rantings ndash though it should be said that his belief in the inferiority of women was typical of his time, and his famous First Blast Of The Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment Of Women was directed not at all women, but specically the Catholic queens. John Loudon McAdam:Road-making revolutionaryBorn into an aristocratic family, John Loudon McAdam moved to New York in , made his fortune there, and ed in . Then he started to experiment with road construction, dabbling with using roadstones in the building of a road from the local highway to his newly acquired estate. He would go on to write papers on the ldquoScientic Repair and Preservation of Roads.In , when he was appointed surveyor to the Bristol Turnpike Trust, he decided to remake the roads under his care with crushed compacted stone layers, shaped with a convex camber for drainage. It was the greatest revolution in road construction since Roman times. His roads were smoother, cheaper and longer-lasting.By the end of the th century most roads in Europe underwent what became known as macadamisation. McAdamrsquos brilliant idea is still there, albeit with a few adaptations including a bit of tar, beneath our wheels whenever we travel. Janet Keiller:Marmalade matriarchIn the th century, Janet Keillerrsquos husband, John, bought a cargo from a Spanish ship after it sought refuge from a storm, for the cake and sweetie shop they ran in Dundee. It happened to be loaded with Seville oranges and Keiller made good out of a bad lot by boiling them with sugar and making marmalade. By  the Keiller factory had begun manufacturing marmalade.Food writer William Sitwell states: ldquoJanet Keiller called her version Dundee Marmalade and it sold so well that it became a byword for Scotland, a key part of Scottish breakfast, a symbol of excellence, a matter of national pride.Did Keiller invent marmalade  The idea is much debated. The Spanish had been making something like it from quince for decades. One food historian created a stooshie in  when he suggested marmalade had been featured in English recipe books long before Keillerrsquos creation ndash though he did confess she was the first to mass produce it.But Three Chimneys chef Shirley Spear, creator of the hot marmalade pudding, retorted: ldquoThere are amazing recipes which go back hundreds of years. But I think marmalade as we know it today is more likely to have been of the kind that the Keillers made. Mary Somerville:Self-taught polymath and worldrsquos first scientistLong before Brian Cox or Sir Patrick Moore, there was Mary Somerville, a great populariser of science in general, but also her most favoured field, astronomy. In , she became the first person to be described in print as a ldquoscientist ndash since she was more than just a physicist or astronomer, but could not be called, the popular term of the time, a ldquoman of science.Much of her thinking was ground-breaking. It was Somerville, for instance, who inspired the discovery of Neptune, when she theorised that the dficulties in calculating the position of Uranus suggested that there may be another planet out there.Twenty years before Charles Darwin published The Origin Of Species, she was writing, in her book Physical Geography, of man being ldquoa fellow-inhabitant of the globe with other created things, yet influencing them to a certain extent by his actions, and influenced in .Itrsquos not just that she was a brilliant self-taught mathematician and scientist, but that she had a gt for communicating ideas. Somerville herself once wrote, ldquoI was intensely ambitious to excel in something, for I felt in my own breast that women were capable of taking a higher place in creation than that assigned to them in my early days. James Keir Hardie:Founder of early Labour partyLabour prime minister Clement Atlee once said, ldquoHardie was not only born of the working class, he remained of the working class. Few members of parliament had a greater effect upon the House of Commons than Keir Hardie. Before the end of the th century parliament consumed itself very little with the le of the common people.

People magazine declared him ldquothe Sexiest Man of the th Century. In  he topped an American poll for the greatest British actor of all time. No other Scot has gone on to become quite the international Hollywood icon that Connery did. None has made Scottishness seem quite so suave. He was also the James Bond that defined Bond.It was Dana Broccoli, Albert ldquoCubby Broccolirsquos we, who identied him as the man for the role ndash appreciating not just his physique, but the fact that he ldquomoved like a panther.His Bond, the ladykiller, may seem like a dinosaur in the #MeToo era, but he still dazzles. Connery brought to Bond something meritocratic rather than aristocratic. He was a former milkman and bodybuilder, who grew up in a two-room Fountainbridge flat with an outside toilet. Connery might have worn a hairpiece in every Bond movie but he didnrsquot fade like many other matinee idols, as he greyed, but held the screen in maturity, clinching a supporting role Oscar in The Untouchables. In his biography, Being A Scot, the longtime backer of independence attributed his success to being Scottish. Isobel Wylie Hutchison: Poet, author, botanist, explorer and painterIsobel Wylie Hutchison walked across Iceland solo, when everyone was warning her not to. It has been said she was the first Scotswoman to travel in Greenland. In the s she journeyed as a lone woman across the top of Alaska and found herself marooned for seven weeks on a sandspit with a fur trader ndash then wrote a compelling memoir about it. In terms of inspirational women who lived outside the expectations of her age, she was a trailblazer. Rather than marry, Wylie Hutchison, who was brought up in Carlowrie Castle, devoted her le to travel and collecting rare plant species. When St Andrews University awarded her an honorary degree in , it was said that she displayed ldquothat indomitable spirit which defies hazard, danger and discomfort, and is the source of all great human achievement. Mary Queen of Scots: Tragic queen and female leaderMore than  years after her bloody execution, therersquos still something about Mary. Recent years have seen it made ldquowoke in a film starring Saorsie Ronan, and charted by historian Kate Williams in Rival Queens, an examination of Maryrsquos relationship with Englandrsquos Elizabeth I. Williamsrsquo book has been described as ldquothe great rivalry reimagined for the #MeToo generation. Why does she remain relevant In part, itrsquos that her story remains so compelling ndash its charged romance, the murder of her secretary and favourite David Rizzio, the killing of her husband Lord Darnley and her violent end. But also therersquos a fascination with the relationship between the two queens. As Kate Williams puts it, ldquoIf we look at her in terms of queenship, she engaged in many acts that Elizabeth was congratulated for ndash but Mary did the same and lost everything. James Watt:Inventor of steam engine and father of industrial revolutionIt was an idea that popped into his mind while he was out for a Sabbath stroll. When James Watt perfected the steam engine in the late th century, he was putting into place the key element that set off industrialisation. So many things followed on, including locomotives, steam-powered ships, factories of multiple types, the transformation of the then water-based cotton industry, Britainrsquos evolution as the first industrial country.It was a revolution that would ultimately lead to the biggest challenge we face today: climate change. Wattrsquos genius stroke was to separate the condenser of a steam engine from the piston cylinder. Later, he would develop the sun and planet gear ndash which could provide a circular motion, thereby powering a wheel, which would then be used in transport and spinning.He even created the unit, the horsepower, to show how strong his engine was by comparing it with the weight a group of ponies could lt. Such was his impact that Andrew Carnegie, in a  book on the inventor, estimated that ldquoin  the value of world industries dependent upon steam was thirty-two thousand millions of dollars, and that in  it had reached forty-three thousand millions of dollars. Elsie Inglis:First World War nurseWhen the Great War broke out and she applied to the Royal Army Medical Corp, Elsie Inglis received a letter back saying, ldquoMy good lady, stay home and sit still. But Inglis, who was one of the first women to graduate from the University of Edinburgh, and set up her own medical practice in , as well as a hospice for poor women, was not one for sitting still.She persuaded the Scottish and National Womenrsquos Suffrage Societies to fund women-run field hospitals, leading to the founding of the Scottish Womenrsquos Hospitals for Foreign Services in . She would be lauded by Winston Churchill as a ldquoheroine who will shine in history. Inglis and her team worked in Serbia, staying on when the Germans advanced and ultimately they were interned, working in a prisoner-of-war hospital.Her unit was sent home in , but she went out again later in the year to join Serbian troops in southern Russia. What it is believed Inglis already knew, but had told no one, was that she had cancer. While out there, she collapsed and sent a telegram home with the news, ldquoEverything satisfactory and all well except me.On the day she landed in Newcastle in , she stood to bid farewell to her Serbian staff, and collapsed. She died the next day.

Not everyone loved it. It was, according to Lord Gowrie, the chairman of the Booker prize , rejected for the shortlist after two judges deemed it offensive. A  Scottish Book Week poll saw Trainspotting named Scotlandrsquos favourite book of the last  years. William Cullen: Inventor of refrigerationBefore fridges we had holes in the ground lined with straw and ice brought down from the mountains. We had to eat stuff immediately or cure it or ferment it. Ice harvesting was a huge business. Then, in , William Cullen, one of the most important figures at the Edinburgh Medical School, devised a method of cooling through using evaporation of a liquid, which would absorb heat from the area it had come off. He didnrsquot make an actual fridge ndash it would take an American inventor to do that ndash but he pioneered the principles in . Eight years later he did a public demonstration of articial refrigeration in which he used a pump to create a partial vacuum in a container of diethyl ether ndash the result was that the liquid boiled. That reaction absorbed heat from the surroundings and produced a small amount of ice. The process is now an essential part of what the author of Chilled, Tom Jackson, has called ldquothe cold chain, which links our perishable food back to the farmerrsquos fields. The refrigerator, as Jackson says ldquohas changed the way we live. Kirkpatrick Macmillan: Created the first bikeIn the early th century, there were no bikes but people did ride on wheeled vehicles called hobbyhorses, propelling themselves along by pushing off the ground with their feet. Dumfriesshire blacksmith Macmillan decided to craft one in his smithy ndash and added horizontal pedals, whose movements were transmitted by cranks to a rear wheel by connecting rods. Macmillanrsquos bike was hard work, but in June , he rode to Glasgow, in a trip that took two days and resulted in him being fined five shillings for mildly injuring a small girl who ran across his path. Macmillan didnrsquot patent his invention, or make any money out of it ndash it was others, like Gavin Dalzell of Lesmahagow, who copied it and did so. Author Gordon Irving, in his book, Devil on Wheels, describes Macmillanrsquos first run: ldquoThe villagers watched in total amazement as he lted his feet to the pedals and went whizzing down the rough highway, the first person anywhere in the world to ride on a velocipede... The bicycle as we know it today had been born. This simple piece of technology looks set to be more important as we are encouraged, in the interest of our fitness and for the sake of the planet, to get on our bikes. John James Rickard Macleod: Physiologist who discovered insulinIt wasnrsquot Aberdonian John James Rickard Macleodrsquos own idea that there was something in the pancreatic secretions that might be involved in controlling blood sugar levels and deficient in those with diabetes. That notion came from surgeon Frederick Banting. But without Macleodrsquos input ndash he was an expert in carbohydrate metabolism running a lab at the University of Toronto ndash the discovery might never have come about. Macleod was, along with Banting, awarded the Nobel prize for the breakthrough. It saved the le of a -year-old boy who was the first human test subject for insulin treatment. Almost a century on we are in the grip of a global pandemic, with rates predicted to rise by % by . Undoubtedly the lives of many millions more will be saved by insulin.

Plus, since they met on a radio show, she has been the forensic inspiration at the heart of crime queen Val McDermidrsquos works, the on-call expert who gives them their scientic grounding. Her book All That Remains, is a challenge to how we view death. ldquoI wanted, she has said, ldquoto show that death has dferent faces ndash scientic, emotional, even hilarious. We think wersquore expected to behave a certain way, but wouldnrsquot it be wonderful , with our last dying breaths, what we hear is people laughing and singing rather than crying  John Muir: Conservationist behind the national parks movement Adam Smith: Father of modern free market economicsAdam Smith brought us the idea of an economics based around the twin ideas of ldquopersonal interest and the ldquoinvisible hand of the market ndash and those principles have been at the heart of much capitalist thinking since, though he himself never used the term capitalism. Smithrsquos Wealth Of Nations is considered one of the most important contributions to economic thought, and it was based around a new idea of the economy, forged in contrast with the prevailing principles of mercantilism of his time. It was generated in th century Scotland, where Smith, who was friends with David Hume, the geologist James Hutton, the chemist Joseph Black, was at the heart of enlightenment thinking.One of the problems with Smithrsquos legacy is that we are often presented with this theory in a caricatured form. Yes, Smith was opposed to all laws and practices that tended to discourage production and increase prices. And, yes, at the heart of his thesis was the idea that an unregulated system would work because each person would try to maximise his or her benefit. But too often we are delivered that theory through the filter of the free-market fundamentalism of economists who followed, particularly the Chicago School. The wider scope of his moral philosophy is often omitted ndash his lamentations, for instance, on the potential social and moral ills of what he called ldquocommercial society. More and more now people are drawing attention to the concerns Smith had over inequality. As Nicola Sturgeon has put it, ldquoAdam Smith is sometimes misquoted, misrepresented by some of his, what I would describe as, ultra-free-market supporters. Adam Smith, yes, knew that personal interest was a motivator of human behaviour. But, you can see in the Wealth of Nations that Adam Smith also knew and wrote that no country, no economy, could be fully successfulmany of the people living within it were poor and we had inequality. So thatrsquos the real legacy of Adam Smith.We live in times of questioning about capitalism, of ain some countries, for instance Trumprsquos America, to a kind of neo-mercantilism. Are there still answers to be found in Smith  Many believe so. Jesse Norman, his biographer observes: ldquoHe has a vast amount to teach us, not merely about economics and markets and trade, but about the deepest issues of inequality, culture and human society facing us. Far from attacking Smith, we must turn to him again. For we cannot understand, or address, the problems of the modern world without him. Moses McNeil, Peter McNeil, Peter Campbell and William McBeath: Founding fathers of Rangers FCPeter McNeil and Moses McNeil, aged  and , and Peter Campbell and William McBeath, both , discussed the possibility of forming a team during a walk through West End Parkin March . The club that has won  Scottish championships essentially started as a street team by a group of boys who had been smitten by the latest sporting craze of association football. They were joined in their endeavours by Tom Vallance, later to become a legendary Rangers captain, but who was then barely  years old.The group called their team ldquoRangers, having seen the name of a Swindon-based rugby club in an English Rugby Football Annual. Their triumph was to be the foundation stone of a Scottish institution. Rangers played their first ever match against Callander FC at Flesherrsquos Haugh on Glasgow Green in May , which resulted in a - draw. Moses McNeil played for the club he helped found for  years, taking part in the  and  Scottish Cup finals and being a member of the first Rangers side to lt a trophy, the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup in . Historians now consider that Peter McNeilrsquos greatest contribution to the formative years of the club was off the field after his playing days. As match secretary, a position he held until , he was in effect the clubrsquos first manager. His administrative skills were recognised in  when he became vice-president. Brother Walfrid: Celtic FC founderAndrew Kerins crossed the Irish Sea during the potato famine and settled in the east end of Glasgow in , aged . After taking up the oath with the Marist Brothers in France, he eventually became a teacher and was assigned to Sacred Heart School in the East End to cater for the childrenrsquos spiritual and educational needs. He established the ldquopenny dinner and set up a boysrsquo clubs, before spotting the potential of football, which had fast been gaining in popularity in the late th century, to raise money by attracting paying customers.During a meeting at St Maryrsquos Church hall in the Calton area on November  , with little fanfare , ldquothe Celtic was formed. It was intended to ldquosupply the East End conferences of the St Vincent De Paul Society with funds for the maintenance of the lsquoDinner Tablesrsquo of our needy children in the Missions of St Maryrsquos, Sacred Heart, and St Michaelrsquos. It is therefore with this principle object that we have set afloat the Celtic. Although formed to raise money for the needy of the East End who were mainly Catholic and Irish, the new club would be neither exclusively Catholic nor Irish. Walfrid remained a largely forgotten figure for much of the th century but in the late s as interest in the so-called ldquoIrish diaspora burgeoned there was renewed attention too on the man who did so many good works in Glasgow. A man who changed tens of thousands of Catholicsrsquo lives for the better and, through his enduring legacy, Celtic, tens of millions. Jackie Stewart: Formula One driver and safety advocateFrom mid- until his retirement at the end of , Sir Jackie Stewart was the undisputed number one and everyone knew it. As well as his unquestioned driving skills ndash  grand prix wins in  races and three world championships ndash this Milton-born legend championed safety in the sport and was the first to wear a seatbelt, insisted circuits should be lined by barriers and called for fire-resistant clothing. When it was called for, the Flying Scot, as he was known, led driver boycotts.Attitudes to safety were very dferent in the s and early s, and Stewart was vilied for his stance. But he didnrsquot care and his one-man safety crusade made the sport much safer. The catalyst for Stewartrsquos safety campaign was an accident he suffered in the  Belgian Grand Prix, when he was left trapped in an upturned car with fuel leaking out and was stuck for  minutes before being rescued. He also recalled counting  deaths while he was racing. Many were friends. ldquoSo many people were killed during that period, he said. ldquoThe only way I can relate to it, thinking back, is that it must have been like World War Two and the Spitfires and Hurricanes leaving the south coast of England to stop the German Luftwaffe. They were losing their colleagues on a regular basis. And so were we. Despite turning  this year, Stewart has not slowed down and is the founder of Race Against Dementia, a charity established to fight against the as yet incurable disease that his we, Lady Helen, suffers from. Mairi Mhor Nan Oran : Gaelic songstress and political campaignerMairi was born in March  at Skeabost on Skye, the daughter of a crofter. When she was about eight the family, following an abortive attempt to emigrate to Canada, settled in Glasgow ing to Skye some  years later. Mairi left in about  and went to Inverness where she married Isaac MacPherson in . After her husbandrsquos death in  she earned her living as a nurse. During this period she was accused of stealing clothing from her employer and imprisoned. She always protested her innocence and her bitterness at the injustice which she had suffered left a deep impression upon her.Upon her release from prison in  she went to Glasgow, where she underwent formal training as a nurse before going on to become a district nurse in Greenock. Her talent for Gaelic poetry and ability for storytelling made her socially and politically signicant in Glasgow. She became a focal point amongst the lsquoexiledrsquo Highlanders in Glasgow and Greenock, and she was present at number of gatherings there. She ed frequently to Skye, finally settling there in . During her time in the Lowlands she had become deeply involved in the Land Agitation movement and she continued to attend meetings in the islands and on the mainland. She also accompanied Charles Fraser Mackintosh on several trips on behalf of the movement. Mairi vigorously opposed the treatment and disenfranchisement of Skye crofters and wrote songs directed at those she held responsible and the indference of those unwilling to act. David Hume: philosopherDavid Hume was a Scottish philosopher, historian and essayist known for his radical philosophical scepticism and empiricism. He believed that passion rather than reason governed human behaviour and that human knowledge was solely based on human experience. Hume was born on February , , in Edinburgh. His father died when he was an infant, leaving him and his two older siblings in the care of his mother. Hume went with his older brother to the University of Edinburgh in .He began his literary journey with his masterpiece, A Treatise of Human Nature while he was living in France for three years. Though the book was widely discarded and written off by the critics then, it is today considered as one of the post important works on the history of Western philosophy. Hume found success only later in his le when he turned into an essayist. His job as a librarian in the University of Edinburgh helped him access a lot of research materials which provided him the guided information for his massive six volume masterpiece, lsquoThe History of Englandrsquo. The book earned favourable response and became a bestseller. It was considered as a standard history of England during its time. Charles Rennie Mackintosh Designer and architectThe Glasgow-born artist and architect attended evening classes at Glasgow School of Art while working as an apprentice to architect John Hutchison. It was through the School of Art that in  he gained his first commission as a professional, and won a prize from the Glasgow Institute of Fine Art, for a design for a terraced house. Between  and  most of the classic buildings associated with Mackintosh emerged. The Glasgow Herald Building was completed in  Ruchill Free Church Halls were completed in  Queens Cross Church opened for worship in  Kate Cranstonrsquos Willow Tearooms opened in  Hill House in Helensburgh was completed in late  The Glasgow School of Art was completed in stages between  and  The Scotland Street School was completed in  and The House for an Art Lover was designed in , though it was not built until the s.Mackintoshrsquos attention to detail was fanatical: in the Scotland Street School, for example, hot water pipes were routed below the coathooks, meaning that pupilrsquos coats were warm and dry at the end of the day. But this attention to detail, which some have attributed to borderline autism on Mackintoshrsquos part, also meant that the projects he led were seldomever profitable. Never as successful or as recognised in his day as he should have been, he has since gone on to become an hugely influential icon, a superstar of the design world. David Livingstone: Missionary and explorerLivingstone became a great hero of the Victorian era for his epic discoveries in the heart of unexplored Africa. He spent the last six years of his le almost cut off from the outside world, refusing to leave his beloved Africa. From an early age, he was fascinated with geology, science and the natural world. He had to work long hours in a local cotton mill from the age of  to . His work in the mills imbued him with a classic Protestant work ethic this experience left him with respect and empathy for workers. Fanny Wright: Feminist and social reformerFrances Wright was one of three children born in Dundee to Camilla Campbell and James Wright, a wealthy linen manufacturer and political radical. Both of her parents died young, and Fannywas orphaned at the age of three, but left with a substantial inheritance. An aunt acted asfor both Fanny and her sister Camilla. Wright was brought up in the homes of relatives, including James Milne, a member of the Scottish school of progressive philosophers. Milne, who encouraged Fanny to question conventional ideas, was to have a lasting influence on her development.She was to go on to tour the US extensively and was appalled by the practice of slavery. She decided to establish a colony in which slaves could be emancipated. She believed that slaves would work harder for their freedom than they would for a master, and therefore expected the colony to be self-supporting and to provide funds for the purchase and training of additional slaves. Due to the effect hard labour at the settlement took on her health, she went abroad to recover. She was later forced to abandon her plan, after spending her personal fortune on it.In the late s Wright was the first woman lecturer to speak publicly before gatherings of men and women in the United States about political and social-reform issues. She advocated for universal education, the emancipation of slaves, birth control, equal rights, sexual freedom, legal rights for married women, and liberal orce laws. Wright was also vocal in her opposition to organised religion and capital punishment. Sir Walter Scott: WriterFrom his earliest years, Scott was fond of listening to his elderly relativesrsquo accounts and stories of the Scottish Borders, and he soon became a voracious reader of poetry, history, drama, and fairy tales and romances. In  he published his first literary work, Minstrelsy of the Scottish Borders. It was his second work which made his name, however The Lay of the Last Minstrelwas an immensely successful poem. Scott followed this with further romantic poems, such as Marmionand The Lady in the Lake .In the decade between  and  Walter Scott published a succession of hugely popular historical novels, beginning with Waverley , Guy Mannering , and Ivanhoe . These books, and others that followed in the s, were published anonymously or under pseudonyms. It was not until  that the author was revealed to be Sir Walter Scott. He helped popularise the historic novel as a literary genre, and influenced generations of future writers. Robert Louis Stevenson: NovelistFrom a very early age, RLS was spinning stories. As a child ndash he was born in Edinburgh in November   ndash he suffered from chronic bronchial disease, and spent much of his childhood alone in bed making up tales. Trained first as an engineer and then as a lawyer, he was always more interested in writing, imitating authors he admired and then, from , publishing essays and working on plays.Conflicted with his father over both religion and earning a living, he led a bohemian le in Edinburgh and took walking tours in Britain and abroad.In , he met the love of his le, the lively American Fanny Van de Grt Osbourne. In , he followed her to Calornia, where they married after Fannyrsquos orce The Silverado Squattersis the story of their honeymoon in an abandoned mining camp. Stevensonrsquos fame grew with the publication of Treasure Island , and in  he and Fanny moved to Bournemouth, where they lived for three years. During this period he wrote Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Kidnapped . He died from a brain haemorrhage working on his very Scottish masterpiece The Weir of Hermiston. Thomas Telford: Godfather of civil engineeringThomas Telford was born near Westerkirk, Dumfries, in , the son of a poor shepherd. He apprenticed for a time to a stonemason in Langholm, and worked on the construction of Edinburghrsquos Newtown, before moving to London in  in search of work. There he helped design and build Somerset House, and later moved to Portsmouth as manager of works at the dockyards. He was responsible for the construction of the Ellesmere Canal in , and the Severn Suspension Bridge at Montford .His success led to a government appointment to survey the roads in rural Scotland as part of a major transportation improvement scheme. His survey results were accepted and Telford was asked to oversee the construction of some , miles of roads and  bridges ndash a job which took him over  years to complete. Also in Scotland, Telford worked on dock improvements in Wick, Aberdeen, Peterhead, Leith, and Banff, as well as the Caledonian Canal project linking a series of freshwater lochs with  miles of canals. His use of the cast iron arch bridge at Craigellachie in Strathspey and the Waterloo Bridge in Wales turned structure into a form of art. In  Telford helped found the Institute of Civil Engineers, and he served as its first president. Alex Salmond:One of the most signicant political figures of recent historyIt is dficult to exaggerate the importance of Alex Salmond to the Scottish National Party. He was responsible not just for hauling the SNP from the fringes of Scottish politics to become a party of government, but also for forming a majority SNP administration at Holyrood and holding a referendum on Scottish independence. Alexander Elliott Anderson Salmond joined the SNP in , while still a teenager. He went on to become a rising star of the party, winning the Westminster seat of Banff and Buchan in  ndash and notably getting himself banned from the Commons chamber for a week after interrupting the chancellorrsquos Budget speech in protest at the introduction of the poll tax in Scotland. When the SNP leadership job came up in , Salmond grabbed the opportunity and repositioned the party as more pro-European. He resigned in , for reasons which remain largely unexplained, but came back again as leader in , to mould his party as a more focused force.Confronted with a combative ndash some might say brash ndash SNP leader, Scottish Labour imploded, losing a series of leaders, and found itself out of power in Westminster too. Following his leadership comeback, on a joint ticket with deputy Nicola Sturgeon, Salmond led the SNP to what was then its greatest hour ndash victory at the  Scottish election and delivery of a minority SNP government. He went on to lead the party to a landslide victory in . The nationalistsrsquo victory brought about a generational sht in Scotland, where Labour had been the dominant force.The result made the independence referendum a certainty and the first minister, along with his government and the wider independence movement, set out a vision of Scotlandrsquos as one of the worldrsquos richest small nations ndash with opponents arguing he was willing to say anything to win a ldquoYes vote. But on the night it wasnrsquot to be, as voters rejected independence by % to % on September  . Salmond stood down as First Minister and SNP leader the next day. He faces nine charges of sexual assault and two of attempted rape, which he denies.Tomorrow: The top  Scots"},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-post-brexit-fairytale","story":"My heart sank.

In this rendering it would reach for a sturdy tool-kit: dferent spending priorities the sharp lurch to the right of the Tories the creation of hostile environments for minorities the one-sided austerity programme providing tax cuts for the wealthy even as it cut basic lelines to disadvantaged communities.The requirement to chivvy the Tories, however, has become redundant. Why attempt to land punches on the acolytes of the Union when they are making such a good job of self-immolation  Brexit and the manner in which the Tory right has approached it constitutes a much more eloquent White Paper on independence than the first one. Certainly, Unionist supporters might invite us to recoil at the prospect of further economic instability with newly-minted and untested independence on top of all the post-Brexit uncertainty. The issue here, though, isnrsquot about further instability itrsquos that the hard Brexiters who now control the UK economy seemed cheerfully insouciant about risking everything while seeming impervious to its social consequences.:Support for Welsh independence reaches lsquohistoric highrsquoLike the expected repercussions of the millennium bug in  some of the more apocalyptic presentiments of Brexit might yet prove to be fancul. This, though, doesnrsquot diminish the most sinister aspect of Brexit: that its most fervent disciples seemed not to care one way or the other. Worse they were prepared to lie and deceive to maintain any convenient fiction. All that mattered was this: that they would be handed a fragile, softened-up, punch-drunk version of Britain, one that could thus be moulded much more easily into that th century caricature of itself that exists in the scrambled dreams of Jacob and the European Research Group.Next Wednesday marks the fth anniversary of the independence referendum and the Yes movement is entitled to think that itrsquos in a good place. With each newly-revealed misdemeanour of the Brexiters support for independence grows among those who werenrsquot persuaded of it first time around. At the base of this, I think, are questions of trust and decency. The three Scottish judges who deemed the prorogation of Parliament to be illegal did so ultimately because they simply didnrsquot believe Boris Johnson. They virtually accused a sitting Prime Minister of lying to his Queen as a means of escaping the scrutiny of the sovereign parliament he is sworn to uphold and from whom he derives his power. This bore all the imprints of a political coup now we know it actually was one. If they can do thisthey can even contemplate doing this then all the other democratic institutions that underpin the way we reach decisions and make choices must be considered fair game too.When left-wing revolutions have occurred where in the world radicals try to justy them, even when they have withered under human corruption. ldquoAt least they were attempted for the benefit of the many, they say. But what lies in store when a revolution is staged by the few who also control our security services  There is a reason why social mobility is scarcer at the top of the UK military than in any other of the UKrsquos social and cultural jurisdictions.The conduct of Brexit, deal or no deal, has permitted the SNP to claim the social and cultural arguments. Their politicians at Westminster, led by the formidable duo of Joanna Cherry and Ian Blackford, have been the driving forces of the anti-Brexit alliance and have provided it with moral purpose. This is symbolic of another rather more perverse irony: that the hallowed institutions of UK identity and pride will be respected and upheld more in an independent Scotland than in a UK ruled by the Johnson Cummings Rees-Mogg axis. Evena deal of sorts is concluded in the next four weeks this remains the most likely outcome of the next General Election.:Paul Hutcheon: the Queen will see off independence, but will her son In Scotland, the ability of the Unionist parties to oppose independence has also diminished. Ruth Davidson, their most eloquent advocate has retired because she too couldnrsquot trust her boss. The Scots Tory MPs who arrived at Westminster on her coat-tails have since been exposed as indolent popinjays of a stamp much more reactionary and right-wing than their Holyrood counterparts, and thatrsquos saying something. Five years ago, too, it seemed that the Labour Party in Scotland had dredged the lowest depths after its leadership turned it into a footstool of the UK Conservatives. Somehow they have since found a lower place and have learned nothing.The sight this week of Anas Sarwar sharing a  with Gordon Brown was wretchedly appropriate. One of these men destroyed himself in an unhealthy obsession with being Prime Minister the other has lately become obsessive about leading Labour in Scotland. To proclaim a message of Hope Not Hate when attacking the Yes movement is cheap, nasty and unworthy of either. Itrsquos a sign of desperation and of itself proof that neither is ndash or ever was ndash cut out for mature leadership. They know and we know that you only need to worry about nationalist movements when they are being proclaimed in countries that are already independent.If independence is delivered, and we are closer to it right now than we ever were at any time during the first referendum, then it will have been gted by a British elite which was unable to camouflage its true nature. Thus, the biggest threat to independence may yet come from within the SNP itself. The cybernats who have been made convenient scapegoatsfor the ills of political discourse are nothing of the sort. Instead itrsquos a toxic troupe of silent assassins which have taken root inside the SNP, under the influence of the Scottish Greens, who could damage the Yes movement. They have previously tried to destroy the careers of Joanna Cherry and Joan McAlpine, two of the SNPrsquos most able operators.

Itrsquos the same over here, with the recent pantomime posturing in parliament over a wee, harmless proroguing making Britland an embarrassment around the world.Embarrassment brings us to Scotland, where wersquore ruledby an independence-supporting party that spends all its time campaigning to remain in a union.No wonder wersquore all harking back to the past, the right to the s, the left to the s. As regards the latter, I never bought into all that ldquowinter of discontent propaganda that the right has cunningly instituted as historical fact.But I wouldnrsquot really like ato the s in all respects. The trousers ndash always a trustworthy barometer of any era ndash were outlandish and the beer in pubs deplorable. No one can doubt that there have been advances ndash not just in trousers and beer ndash since the s. But there has also been decline: in civility, common sense, the quality of confectionery, and morally uplting persecution of the wealthy.As for the future, for the first time Irsquom thinking of not voting for anyone. I think Irsquod prefer a system where, rather than backing one party, you could put ticks beside their ious policies. However, that would probably take an hour or so and, lacking the relative leisure of the s, I suspect wersquore probably all far too busy for that sort of thing.++++WOULD I take a child of mine to the football  I would not. I would shield himfrom it, telling them itrsquos just a television programme, and that the stadia in reality are no more susceptible to visits than Narnia or the Klingon Empire.The reason is that the language, rage and violent gestures of the fans would expose them to a side of human nature Irsquod rather they didnrsquot see. Perhaps I just mean Scottish nature. Here, fans are more permanently furious and downright rude than where.Even in England, which my researchers tell me is quite near here, camera shots of fans beside the touchline show a generally good-natured, happy crowd, whereas here theyrsquore always standing up and pointing furiously or shouting vile insults.I write after revelations about the appalling abuse from rival fans suffered by Celtic captain Scott Brown. I donrsquot want to sound a note of controversy, but football is just a game and, objectively speaking, is really rather daft.No player should have to experience the ghastly taunts that Brown has. He wouldnrsquot have to suffer such abuseCeltic were playing a crunch game against White Witch United or Klingon Rovers.++++SHOULD the police even be tweeting  In todayrsquos PC world, theyrsquore forever emitting right-on bilge, leading the lieges to lose confidence in them.Their latest attempt to show theyrsquore looking after us featured a tweet advising every citizen to prepare a ldquograb bag in case of some unspecied emergency. The warning came out of the blue, so to say, and was prefaced by a peculiar claim that September is ldquopreparedness month, implying that we can remain safely unprepared the rest of the year.Items that terried punters were encouraged to pack included flashlight, radio, batteries, personal toiletries and whistle. Irreverent punters responded with their own essential items, usually alcohol-related, including gin, gin and gin, while in Scotland square sausage and Irn Bru appeared among the staples.Fortunately, as someone who fears disaster any moment, I have for some years carried a ldquoRab-bag containing notebook, camera, whisky flask, copy of The Hobbit, spare wig, taser , change of underpants, and a dinner jacket.One wonders, though,the police have intelligenceabout something about to happen in September. Brexit-fuelled civil disorder  Empty shelves in the supermarkets  Inclement weather  I think we should be told.++++MOST commentators agree that, when the end of British civilisation comes, the symbolic moment will be the closure of John Lewis.The favourite store of ldquoMiddle England and the Other Bits exudes cosy warmth, stability and good taste. That it has become largely unaffordable may be one reason why it has suffered its first half-year loss.Certainly, one notices some departments ndash particularly electronics ndash with more staff than customers, while others, such as stationery in my experience, arenrsquot staffed at all. As Irsquom more likely to buy three quid writing paper than a five-grand wraparound TV set, this leaves me discombobulated.In a surprise development, the store has blamed Brexit uncertainty for its woes, just as in  it set up Scottish independence as an Aunt Sally. This exclusive revelation just in: not one person in the land is deciding whether or not to buy a bed, writing paper or wraparound television on the basis of Brexit uncertainty.One good bit of news to emerge from the sad fall in profits is that the store might ditch its ldquoNever Knowingly Undersold pledge. It was always predicated on the premise that customers were too polite to point out that it was bilge.Read more: Itrsquos hard for a PM to be on fire when he gets a weekly grilling"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-public-infrastructure-projects-hamstrung-legacy-tory-labour-pfi-schemes","story":"On procurement itself, the public purse is being stfed with a huge debt overburden due to PFI scams introduced from the time of John Majorrsquos Governmentto ldquoprivatise public investment. Profits are enormous, with little apparent risk to the lenders involved, and resultant build quality is poor . The building contractors should obviously pay the penalty, but too often the contracts are poorly drafted, no bonds are posted and companies regularly go bust expunging liability.

Has this same scenario, or similar, been the cause of all of the problems at the Queen Elizabeth in Glasgow  Surely some of the blame must also lie with the Scottish Government, as high-cost, publicly-funded projects would surely have had their documentation checked by it too  This error goes beyond carelessness.George Dale, Beith.THIS week, the interim leader of the Tories in the Scottish Parliament got manna from Heaven in the shape of problems at new hospitals in Scotland, and used these to avoid any mention of the interim leader of the British Tories who had been publicly castigated by three of Scotlandrsquos most senior judges. At First Ministerrsquos Questions, Mr Jackson hectored on about faults in the new hospital but he would have been justly incandescentthe Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman had not stopped the opening of the new hospital.Incidentally the word ldquoegregious has been only vaguely known by me over the years, but its use by Lord Brodie in the prorogation case of the Westminster Parliament led me to check my dictionary the definition was ldquooutstandingly bad, flagrant.It was no wonder Mr Jackson was anxious to avoid any mention of Boris Johnson.Jim Lynch, Edinburgh EH.THE SNP never likes to be seen to fail. Disguising this all-too-resent aspect of its term in office, now approaching  years, has been achieved by kicking everything into the long grass by setting up committees or saying \"lessons will be learned\". The grass is now a wilderness.No excuses are adequate to describe the mistakes and delays in this flagship hospital over several years. These years have seen very ill children therefore being treated in less than satisfactory conditions simply due to the age of the building, not staff application. This is not on and now yet more taxpayers money is being used to fix what should have been excellent. There really can be no excuses now. Nicola Sturgeon has a favourite word to describe the opposition, it is \"shambles\". This shambles has simply joined the queue behind the economy, transport and education in her back court now.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.BARONESS Kennedy, Labour member of the House of Lords, made a statement on the BBCwhich has major implications for Scotlandit represents a widely-held position. Baroness Kennedy, in the context of a Brexit discussion, asserted that since referendums were advisory, Parliament did not require to implement their outcomes. Also, she was completely opposed to having any referendums.Assuming she had given this some thought, this would mean thatthe Scottish people voted for independence in a referendum, there would be no obligation to act on it. Alsoreferendums are to be ruled out, what would constitute a legitimate route to achieve independencethis has majority support  Is she suggesting that it should be a majority of Scottish MPs that would trigger independence negotiations  Or have we to wait until a majority of the enlightened opinion at Westminster decide for us  One thing the Brexit issue has done is to flush out a lot of confused thinking on both sides.Isobel Lindsay, Biggar.I HAVE just been watching Question Time on BBC  . Once again I have heard the same fundamental error repeated by both pro- and anti- groups: that we must respect the democratic decision of the people in the  referendum. One speaker even said that Parliament is not sovereign, the people are sovereign. This is nonsense. We elect a Parliament which is sovereign and has not only the sole right but also the duty to govern.A referendum can only be consultative, a test of public opinion, not a policy-deciding process which the government has to obey. This lies at the heart of the dangerous situation which our country now faces. Where are the constitutional lawyers who must know that this the issue  Parliament decides on policy after debates, readings, consultation in both Houses by people who have a reasonable chance of understanding the issues and only Parliament can finally decide government policy.Kenneth Roberts, Lenzie.Read more: Sturgeon under pressure at FMQs over hospitals crisis"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-scotland-force-good-world","story":"While the Scottish First Minister said the last  years had been defined by the Conservatives austerity agenda and the pursuit of Brexit, the next period should be about \"what Scotland can do for the world\".Ms Sturgeon, who was addressing business leaders in Glasgow, argued that in recent years the policies of \"the most reckless, self-interested UK government in living memory\" had hindered efforts to make Scotland a fairer and more prosperous nation.Speaking at the Business for Scotland dinner, she said: \"We are reaching the end of a decade which will be remembered for two Tory obsessions - austerity and Brexit.\"Both of these have been an unmitigated disaster - not just for Scotland, but for the whole of the UK.: Boris Johnson is a serial liar who doesnt recognise the truth anymore\"The ideologically driven cuts to Scotlands budget have choked off the economic recovery and put incredible pressure on our public services.\"And the Brexit referendum, which was cynically designed to heal isions in the Tory party, has instead brought the UK to its knees.\"She hit out at Prime Minister Boris Johnson over his decision to suspend Parliament in the run-up to the UKs exit from the European Union on October  - saying that he \"appears to have misled the Queen, misled Parliament and misled the country\".Noting that Scotland had voted to stay part of the EU in the  referendum, Ms Sturgeon said: \"We didnt vote for Brexit, we didnt vote for Boris Johnson, and we certainly didnt vote for the catastrophic no-deal Brexit which is now being imposed on us. \"The SNP leader added: \"As we reach the end of this decade, lets all resolve that the next one will not be defined by that which is done to Scotland.: Scotland is closer to independence than it ever was in , says Kevin McKenna\"Instead, lets resolve that the next decade should be defined by what Scotland can do for the world.\"Lets resolve to use Scotlands immense human and natural resources to build a fairer and more prosperous nation - an economic powerhouse which is a force for good both at home and abroad.\""},{"url":null,"title":"passenger-unable-check-ryanair-systems-outage","story":"Twitter users complained of ldquochaos at Stansted Airport on Saturday morning, with many struggling to find their booking details online.The budget airline confirmed that the outage resulted in disruption to airport check-ins and boarding.@Ryanair once again you have surpassed yourselves!

It was abolished by the Family LawAct , except for very particular circumstances, and so only relationships established before May  will be recognised.“They are getting in touch with me to arrange a visit to the house to speak with me and ask questions about our -year relationship,” said Ms Robertson.“Under Scottish law,myself, Gary and others before  saw us as husband and we then I should have a good case. They will have to interview people that knew us but that won’t be a problem as we were seen and did live as common law husband and we.”Ms Robertson switched jobs and moved house to care for Mr Dunn who was disabled and the loving couple brought up a daughter together.

Others for holding it and losing it, he says in the interview. ldquoThere are, of course, all those people who wanted a referendum and wanted to leave who are glad that a promise was made and a promise was kept.Mr Cameron says he has ldquohad some robust exchanges when askedmembers of the public shout at him in the street. He also reveals that on the morning after the EU referendum, he called European leaders and US president Barack Obama to say ldquosorry for the result. The vote left him ldquohugely depressed, Mr Cameron admits. ldquoI think about this every day. Every single day I think about it, the referendum and the fact that we lost and the consequences and the things that could have been done dferently, and I worry desperately about what is going to happen next.He adds: ldquoI was miserable about giving up the job I loved and working for the country I loved. I was miserable.Mr Cameron says a no-deal Brexit would be a ldquobad outcome for the country, adding: ldquoI very much hope it doesnrsquot happen.

I worked with him well, as I say in the book, he said. ldquoI also say that he was a capable mayor. He was easy to work with. I thought he was very talented. I wanted him in my government. Wersquove had issues. Even before Brexit, there were sometimes tensions and disagreements but, on the whole, wersquove got on well. And I want him to succeed. Look, hersquos got a very clear strategy and plan. Itrsquos, you know, not the approach that I would have taken, but I want him to succeed.The former prime minister also told the Times he did not support the removal of the whip from Tory MPs ndash nor the suspension of Parliament.He said: ldquoOf course, as a new prime minister, I wished Boris well. I wanted him to get a deal from the EU that would have passed in the House of Commons. If that was to happen, I would have been elated.

We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September. Acts on the bill include Niteworks, Elephant Sessions, Lau, Tide Lines and Peat and Diesel as well as DJs Erol Alkan, Optimoand Leon Vynehall.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2471_6September19_Page_01crop.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 6th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

The majority of his pupils would only have a primary school education, but the lessons learned at Tullygrawley have never left them. Guided by Master Russell, they produced art and poetry to a standard many children of today would struggle to match.Alison met a number of Master Russell’s pupils – some now in their nineties – whose memories of school days  and  years ago are as fresh and vivid asthey happened yesterday.She discovered their work, preserved in the collections of the Braid Museum and the Causeway Coast and Glen’s Council.One of the many hand printed linographs, hand drawings and poetry prose produced by pupils at Tullygrawley School under the tutelage of Master R.L Russell.

The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer. Working with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and Dalriada Urgent Care, there is a planning and training programme organised for January soyou are interested check the group out on Facebook.The group posted recently: “One thing has become clear in the course of our first month’s activity -we need to recruit and train more responders. “We are working with NIAS on dates for another training course and this will determine our recruitment timetable.”A spokesperson added: “We owe huge thanks to those who made our new service possible.“The people and organisations who contributed so generously to help us meet our funding needs.“The NIAS Community Resuscitation Development Team, who guided us through the complexities of setting up the scheme, trained our members for us and continue to support us.“The Governance team at Dalriada Urgent Care, who supported us in our recruitment efforts and other vital matters such as insurance.“The front line staff of NIAS who have supported and guided us on scene.“And, last but certainly not least, our volunteers, who continue to give the community their time and newly-acquired expertise and to meet their new challenges with great resilience and good humour.“Its a privilege to work with you.”Follow the Braid Valley Community First Responders on Facebook to keep up to date with all their news and to see how you can become involved.

In truth, the margin of defeat flattered St John’s who, for the second game running, failed to fire.They got out of jail at the weekend when an injury-time Pearse Donnelly goal almost plundered an unlikely victory before Conal Delargy kicked the equaliser. The general consensus was that Casements had missed the boat and that the Johnnies would win the replay, but Portglenone boss Barry Dillon said he knew his players could better Sunday’s performance. “We sat back too deep on Sunday, it was our own fault,” said Dillon. “Maybe the fear of winning made them a bit apprehensive, but we knew we had more in us. “In the first half of the drawn game, we showed we are the better team and we had that belief coming into this game that we could go and finish it.” While Portglenone fielded an unchanged team from Sunday’s drawn game, St John’s started Domhnall Nugent, Brian ‘Bam’ Neeson and Sunday’s goal-scorer Donnelly. Yet, as was the case on Sunday, it was Casements who made the brighter start with a hat-trick of frees from Conal Delargy and Ronan Kellyhelping them establish a - to no score lead after a cagey opening  minutes. It took the Johnnies  minutes to open their account following a well-worked move finished by Matthew Fitzpatrick, but Paddy Kelly responded in kind for Portglenone minutes later. Peter McCallin got his side’s second score on  minutes with St John’s struggling to break down a well-organised Portglenone defence. The Whiterock Road men then lost Donnelly to a black card and Delargy converted another free to move his side - to - ahead. When Kieron McKenna added another from play, Portglenone looked in a strong position approaching half-time and a Paddy McBride free with the last kick of the half was badly needed by the under-par West Belfast outfit. The second half was just four minutes old when Portglenone cut a dash through the heart of the St John’s defence to score a brilliant goal with full-forward Michael Donnelly firing past Padraig Nugent. Less than a minute later, St John’s hit back with a goal of their own. Having been off-target with a few efforts from frees,Neeson’s fortunes changed when an attempt at a point dipped under the crossbar and beyond the reach of Portglenone goalkeeper Ryan O’Neill. That should have been the catalyst for St John’s to kick on, but instead it was Portglenone who regained control of proceedings as another Delargy score moved them four clear once more. St John’s continued to squander chances at the other end with Neesonand Fitzpatrick firing wide of the posts. McBride converted a free before Dermot McAleese broke forward to score for Casements. Ryan McNulty landed a stunning point from play with  minutes of normal time remaining, yet their hopes of another rousing comeback were dented when they lost centre-forward Conal Kelly to a second booking. McBride briefly reduced the gap to two points while Nugent was forced to make a great save to deny Niall McKeever at the other end. Michael Kelly scored an excellent point moments after his introduction for Portglenone and a Ronan Kelly free gave them a four-point cushion approaching full-time. Rather than sit back and defend their lead as they did last Sunday, Dillon’s men went for the jugular and further points from McKeever and midfielder Fergal O’Kane put them six clear. There was one last surge from St John’s with Michael Bradley’s sideline being fisted into the net by Fitzpatrick deep into stoppage time and the Antrim star had a second goal-bound shot blocked with the final play of the game. Yet Portglenone were the better team over the two games and they progress to a semi-final meeting with Lámh Dhearg on Saturday, September  at Creggan.

For Martin Moreland, Principal of Mercy College, it was very dferent indeed.Born on the Ormeau Road in South Belfast, Martin was the youngest of six children. Having left school with no exams, Martin’s road to the classroom and education sector began as an engineer.“I never really thought I would be a teacher because I never had the confidence to be one,” he explained.“It was a dream in a sense but I never really thought it would be a reality.“I left secondary school with no exams. I went out into the world of work – it gives you a lot of le experiences or the real world as I call it.“I went into engineering and had several jobs. My we has a job in education and she told me about a course up in Derry that gave you access into university. I went and got a GCSE in English and Maths and spent three years up in Derry doing the course.Martin was accepted into St Mary’s University College and after his first teaching job in West Belfast, has moved to the North of the city.“With my engineering background, my first job was a Technology and Design teacher in St Colm’s in Twinbrook and I spent  years there. I loved it there, it was a great community and a school that was thriving.“I moved on to Mercy where there was just  kids. I started off as a teacher before becoming Principal and I’ve been in the role for ten years.”Martin then reflected on the many changes in education over the years, not least the challenges and successes of Mercy College.“When I came in, it was about building up confidence and profile of the school, given our location in North Belfast.“Pupil numbers now are  but our challenges now is very much to do with space and classrooms.“We have been co-educational for a few years now which is fantastic. We have a   ratio girls and boys in Year . Our LLS programme is still really successful and we were the first school to start that.“The standards are amazing – % of girls are getting three A-Levels from A* to C which is very unique. % of our GCSE students got five GCSE’s at the top grades and there are not many other schools in the North that can boast such results.“Finances remain a huge challenge for us. There is no room for any extra money in the system. It is not easy at all.”Away from school, Martin is kept a busy man being a father of ten children.“I am a family man. I am a father-of-ten so at home it is a very busy household, with the kids ranging from  to .“I am very much an outdoor person. I like nature and sunshine. I am also big into running and gardening. With my technology background, I like a project such as a pond or a patio to keep me entertained.”As for the future, Martin is content at Mercy College but would love no more than see a new building for the school in his working le.“I am  now and I suppose you start to think about how many more years I can give in education.“I probably have another ten years in me. I am happy at Mercy College – there are so many challenges every year.“I really want to see our newbuild come for the school which is in the pipeline – just need Stormont up and running to approve it.“The future of the school is very bright. There is a lot of work still to be done to maintain our standards and results and improve facilities for the kids.“"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem.

In the first speech from one of leader Jo Swinson’s top team at the party conference in Bournemouth, she said: “Now, like Trump, Johnson is talking about ‘extreme weather conditions’ – he is moving away from the acceptance of climate change. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Boris Johnson was accused of acting like a ‘climate change denier’ “Theyare even talk about reducing fuel duty. These are the words and actions of climate change deniers.” As mayor of London, Mr Johnson shrank the congestion zone but rolled-out a city-wide bike hire scheme and vowed to “lie down in front of those bulldozers” rather than see a third runway built at Heathrow Airport. Ms Hobhouse said “populist” leaders across the globe were using the impact of climate change to their own advantage. “Whether it is Trump, or Bolsonaro, Putin, or any other dictator across the world, they all actively encourage activities that create environmental chaos, ision, social instability and economic disruption. Because these are the conditions in which they thrive,” she told party members at the Bournemouth International Centre.

She singled out for criticism the decision to scrap the Department for Energy and Climate Change and blasted the Government’s policy of pursuing fracking – which has resulted in drilling that has caused earth tremors in Lancashire in recent weeks – as “madness”. The party’s climate change spokeswoman told supporters that the Lib Dems could support future airport expansion – but onlyan alternative to jet fuel was found. “In aviation, we urgently need to find an alternative to jet fuel. This development could take  years. Until then, Liberal Democrats will not support any airport expansion across the UK,” said Ms Hobhouse. “For the Green Party, aviation is the problem, for the Lib Dems, jet fuel is the problem.” The conference is due to debate the party’s climate change policy, which includes setting up a citizens assembly to decide on how best to tackle the threat of changing weather and rising sea levels, on Monday. If approved, the idea for citizens assemblies would form part of the Lib Dem manesto at the next election."},{"url":null,"title":"abandoned alleycat learns how to walk again at battersea","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are other guys in Derry who are on the edge of that, the problem with this is and Declan Morgan was right, there is a human cost, a psychological cost, a physical cost.“People are getting their hopes built up thinking something is going to happen and then they’re deflated again, you can only pull yourself up so many times.“I’m having dficulty pulling myself up week by week, to continue fighting this, and it would be a hell of a lot more dficult for people who aren’t aware of the detail and the argument that goes into getting this far.”For victims it is about much more than monetary compensation, that comes secondary to an apology from the state and institutions responsible and a package that enables them to move on with their lives in a better way – which includes appropriate healthcare and support.Last Friday, Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland Sir Declan Morgan said it was \"shocking\" that victims are still awaiting action.He revealed that before Sir Anthony Harte, who chaired the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, died, he had expressed \"profound disappointment\" at the lack of progress.Sir Declan said it \"epitomises how the lack of an assembly impacts negatively on the lives of Northern Irelands citizens\".‘Absolute disgrace’The Historical Institutional Abuse Redress Bill was listed amongst parliament business on Monday but was not dealt with because of prorogation.Mr McCourt believes the suspension of parliament by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has essentially “killed off” the Redress Bill.“To all intents and purposes the Redress Bill is killed off. If the legislation is not passed and hasn’t gone through the House of Lords and received the royal seal of approval then it is killed off.“The fact that it hasn’t been dealt with at this stage is an absolute disgrace, Declan Morgan is right to bring it back up again.“Even at this point they are still talking about it being a devolved matter, the hope of having this dealt with through the NI Assembly does not exist, the only avenue for this to go forward is through Westminster.\"Speaking at Westminster on Tuesday, Independent Unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon said she was \"extremely annoyed and disgusted\" that the motion to discuss historical abuse in NI wasnt even moved because of prorogation.\"By proroguing parliament tonight, the Prime Minister has wilfully and deliberately deprived victims of a -minute debate. He has sent out a clear signal that those victims to not even merit a debate.“It’s appalling, I ask the Secretary of State to demand that the Prime Minister comes to NI, sits at the meeting and looks the victims of HIA in the face and explains to them why he is so disrespectful and discourteous of the hurt and the suffering that they have had to endure.”Unexpected and emergency debates were to blame, Julian Smith explained, and he apologised for the change in business which he said “in no way diminishes how seriously I’m progressing the issues or affected the commitments I have made.”Mr Smith said officials have prepared the policy and lawyers the draft law and he has asked that it be included in the Queen’s speech as a matter of urgent priority.He was however challenged about why legislation hasn’t been brought forward and was told that the state is failing victims yet again.Scotland’s progressIn Scotland their inquiry is ongoing, the report is not written, but the Scottish First Minister has instructed the civil service to initiate an advanced payment scheme. Anyone over  years of age or with a terminal illness can now apply for an award of £, – which is not their full and final settlement.Some child migrants who were taken from homes in Northern Ireland and shipped off to Australia have also received payments.Mr McCourt believes the same could have been done for victims in Northern Irelandthere had been the political will to do it.The HIA inquiry studied allegations of abuse in  homes and other residential institutions between  to .These were run by the state, local authorities, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and the children’s charity Barnardo’s. The largest number of complaints related to four Catholic-run homes.A report in  recommended that victims should receive compensation, however, the process of securing compensation stalled when devolution collapsed in the same week.After a four-year Inquiry and over two and a half years since the publication of the report, the government has still failed to deliver a promised apology and financial redress.In recent weeks Secretary of State for NI, Julian Smith, gave assurances to victims that a Redress Bill would be fast-tracked through Westminster. But Brexit, and the suspension of parliament, has placed yet another roadblock in front of victims.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Termonbacca where historical institutional abuse took place.  Campaigner Jon McCourt has highlighted that another HIA victim has passed away before receiving compensation."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

Members were told that a key element of this innovation project was the provision of mechanism to support the transfer of skills and expertise to company staff and university students.Personalised MedicineIn relation to the prioritisation of the Future Fund of £m and the further anticipated match funding from NI Government and other partners, the emphasis is on advancing with projects such as the Graduate Medical School as a key catalyst for the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus. The delivery of a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellenceat Ulster University and Altnagelvin is also a priority for this fund as is the provision of an integrated, Council-wide, multi-skills employment pathways intervention support programme.The report advised that work on these innovation projects as well as the proposed SMART and digital city projects were advancing in close collaboration with local industry and partners and relevant government departments, while the strategic outline cases for major regeneration projects for Derry City and Strabane Town Centre are at an advanced stage of progress.The Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence intends on harnessing the power of Genomics to predict and diagnose inherited and acquired disease, and to personalise treatments and interventions.The Ulster University representatives said it will expand its partnership with Genomics Ireland and other commercial enterprises to sequence the genomes of % of NI’s population contributing to a research database that can be interrogated to develop personalised medicine solutions with worldwide application and valuable I.P. and how it will also contribute to health improvement locally through a unique ‘community buy-in’ approach.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wOVxcXC8wOTEyMTkwNlxcXC9TVFJBQkFORS1ERVZJQ0UtLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjhlOTFmNGZjY2ExNDE2YjZiOGFkN2MwMzExOGY0ZWQ0NThmOWJlMmIifQ==/strabane-device.png","title":"security operation creggan area derry following discovery mortar device strabane","story":"District Commander Superintendent Gordon McCalmont said: \"It is our assessment that the New IRA is responsible for the mortar device that was discovered outside homes in Church View Close in Strabane on Saturday morning th September.

For example, can lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights in the town centre  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking Cllr Curran said he believes that all the key players need to get together, suggesting years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors to the town.He added: ldquoIt is time to forensically examine the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. What people, in particular those in the business community want to see, is action in addressing the congestion nightmare..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Cool.jpg","title":"Cool Daniel club champ  ","story":"THE Ardglass Club Championship, played over  holes last week, saw Daniel Vaughan declared club champion for the fth time.

Wersquoll do this is by doing our part to tackle the growing issue of poverty in the UK and our Fight Hunger campaign is part of this work.Roger and Linda, along withy other staff members from the Downpatrick store, recently visited the Fountain Foodbank to see the impact the donations have made, to meet volunteers and find out more about how the foodbank works.The foodbank provides emergency food parcels to those who find themselves in dficult circumstances and has distributed over three thousand food parcels in the local area since opening in March .It also receives weekly donations of fresh food from Asda as part of an ongoing scheme with FareShare which has  yearsrsquo experience working with the food industry to safely ert edible surplus through a UK-wide network of frontline charities fighting food poverty.FareShare works with businesses and charities to get food to good causes in a way thatrsquos cost effective and makes sense for the business and the charities, with the Fountain Foodbank registered to receive some of this food.The volunteers say this particular initiative is an effective way to cut down on waste and help those who find themselves in dficult circumstances.Asda says that by the end of the Fight Hunger campaign, it aims to provide an additional  million meals every year by investing in the charitiesrsquo infrastructure and services so they can collect, store and transport more food.In addition, the store aims to provide , vulnerable people access to fresh food every year and make fresh food the norm in food banks and not the exception.Asda also wants to tackle the root causes of poverty, helping one million people with the food and support they need to help them out of the situation they are in and expand the companyrsquos existing food donation activities so every one of its stores has the ability to donate edible surplus food to local food banks and community groups..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 4%2C 1979  ","story":"WARRENPOINT mdash A plea by Official Unionists to adjourn this weekrsquos meeting of Down Council because of the murders at Warrenpoint and Mullaghmore was rejected the SDLP and Alliance members.The motion to adjourn was defeated by ten votes to six and immediately the Unionists walked out mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuesaid he would be impartial in the matter and was quite sure they all shared the revulsion, horror and disgust and would like to show their sympathy with those were bereaved ldquoin such a dreadful way.He pointed out that there had been two committee meetings of the council since the murders occurred, but since Mr Finlayrsquos motion was a procedural matter councillors must decide without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors approve of the vile deeds which have been perpetrated.After the vote, in which the SDLP and Alliance members voted against the Unionists, Mr Finlay said he was sorry about the decision which the majority had made.NEWCASTLE mdash The fireworks display organised as the climax of the Newcastle summer season did not go down with a bang, but instead fizzled out.Torrential rain minutes before the fireworks bonanza was due to begin washed the show out and it now seems likely that the display will be held at Halloween at Downpatrick racecourse instead.Drumgath Accordion Band and Ballykeel Pipe Band were about to march into the arena to put on a marching exhibition when the rain came down.More than pound had been spent on the fireworks, but the rockets, roman candles, catherine wheels, shells, mortars and numerous other favourites were saved from the rain.

The proposed new school will also be in the trusteeship of the De La Salle Congregation.St Patrickrsquos Grammar has maintained its opposition to the merger proposal since it was muted in , while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos support the merger.Mr Joe McCann, St Patrickrsquos Grammar principal, said he is ldquodisappointed that an apparent EA source had broken the news of the merger plan locally before his and the other schools were formally notied.St Patrickrsquos parent body mdash The Parents and Friends Associationmdash said that it will ldquovehemently fight these proposals with every means necessary, through the courts and, unfortunately, in the media.PFA spokesperson, Cormac Artt, criticised the EA on how the news was leaked ahead of the schools being notied last Thursday and the argument that local children will be educated together and the likelihood of capital funding for a single-site school build.Mr Artt continued: ldquoThis proposal cites an enrolment of  pupils and alleges that this yearly intake will be made up of up to % who will be admitted by academic selection.ldquoHowever, the census figures suggest thatall those who live within a three-mile radius and those for whom the school is the nearest Catholic grammar are admitted automatically without sitting the GL entrance assessment, there will be very few,any, places for those applicants seeking admission via academic selection.Mr Artt suggested that the outworking of this means that the rural communities and primary schools who have been an integral part of the grammar schoolrsquos -year history, will no longer have a place in this proposed super school, including those in Teconnaught, Loughinisland, Strangford, Kilclief, Dundrum, the Ards peninsula, Castlewellan and Newcastle.ldquoThe choice for boys in these areas who wish an academically selective education will therefore be travel to Newry or Belfast to try to secure a selective grammar school place in Catholic schools that are already heavily oversubscribed, he said.ldquoThe alternative for those who wish to keep the tradition and connection with Downpatrick will be to attend the state academically selective, Down High School. Aside from the injustice of this on the rural communities, is the impact this will have on families.While the EA said that the proposals have ldquoalready been subject to formal stakeholder consultation with parents, staff, governors and pupils, Mr Artt disputed that.ldquoParents of students from St Patrickrsquos Grammar requested a meeting with the De La Salle Trustees in April to discuss the Trusteesrsquo vision going forward. They finally responded in June by refusing to meet the parents citing rsquoit is not clear what,anything, will be gained by a meeting,rsquo which clearly makes the parents think that they do not care about the pupils of the school where they are Trustees.ldquoThe Board of Governors, staff and parents are overwhelmingly opposed to this proposal and for the De La Salle Trustees, who are the only stakeholder supporting this vision, to refuse to speak to the current parents is a disgrace.De La Salle principal, Ciaran Maguire, said he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He told the Recorder: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.ldquoThe De La Salle Congregation have been working on bringing post primary education in Downpatrick into the st century. In , they first proposed that St Patrickrsquos Grammar should become a co-educational school.ldquoThe Department of Education at the time wanted to see a proposal that was reflective and inclusive of all schools in the Downpatrick area. That advice was taken by the De La Salle congregation and they have been working, in partnership, on a solution to ensure that all children in the greater Downpatrick area have an education system that they can be proud of.Mr Maguire said the origin of the transfer test ldquowas a solution to a problem back then, suggesting the problem is dferent now and a new solution is needed.He added: ldquoWhat we need now for our children is something radical and exciting for all those involved. If we are the child-centred schools we say we are, then this is undeniably the right thing to do, not just for my pupils, but for the St Maryrsquos girls and St Patrickrsquos boys.Mr Maguire contended that while some may see the proposal as ldquoas an attempt to wipe out a schoolrsquos history and tradition, itrsquos an opportunity for them to continue their great work in preparing our children for le.He said that it will cater for all children from the local feeder schools, without the fear of having to sit and possibly fail a test.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe are removing barriers those same barriers that our children currently struggle with, the fear and anxiety of not fitting in, not being good enough. I urge all parents to get behind this proposal, your opinion matters and should count.Welcoming the proposed merger, St Maryrsquos High School principal, Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, said ldquoit has the ability to deliver.She added: ldquoWe are very proud of our school as a centre of excellence and we look forward to this new opportunity of proposed change to serve all young people..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Migle.jpg","title":"Migle thanks foster parents for help in education success  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH woman has thanked her foster carers for the key role they played in her educational success.Miglehas revealed how growing up in foster care helped shape her future career as the Regional Adoption and Fostering Service launches a new campaign encouraging more people to become foster carers across the Provincersquos health trusts.Migle was fostered by South Eastern Trust foster carers Michael and Martha eight years ago and is currently studying Computer Science at Queenrsquos University Belfast.She moved in her with foster parents when she was  and admits she would not be where she is today without their support.ldquoBefore I went to live with Michael and Martha I never even thought about going to university, said Migle who moved to Northern Ireland in  from Lithuania.ldquoThey were able to help me choose what I wanted to do with my le.

Over the past three years Irish Lights has proactively engaged with the local community and relevant state agencies to establish the best approach to the site. he continued.ldquoWe have now developed and tested new technology to achieve a sustainable solution that will enable retention of the historic lens and sweeping beam at St. Johnrsquos Point. I look forward to meeting with the community to discuss these plans in more detail.The Lecale Lightkeepers say that while they accept there is some concession on CILrsquos part in proposing to keep the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, they have been informed by the Commissioner that the range of the beam will be reduced by up to nine miles. They also claim that the beamrsquos iconic ldquoloom will be lost, robbing the lighthouse of what they describe as its ldquointangible heritage.A spokesperson for campaigners said that through their freedom of information requests for communication between CIL and others, they have found a ldquolack of appreciation for the intangible heritage of lighthouses and a disregard of the views of coastal communities.ldquoWe have seen examples of modernised lights and none have retained their original characteristics. The new light source proposed for St Johnrsquos Point would be an LED which, in itself is suspect, as according to the Royal Society Publication April , LEDs have detrimental effects on Epaunal Marine Communities.Campaigners say Newry Mourne and Down Council has already voted unanimously to protect the sweeping beamrsquos current mechanism and trustsrsquos that CIL will not be given planning permission to proceed with its proposal.ldquoThe lighthouse is a listed building and its character, the light, must be protected, declared the campaignersrsquo spokesperson.ldquoWith the loss of the historic lights at Fastnet, Mew and Tory it is even more vital that St Johnrsquos Point should be kept for heritage purposes.

We as a family remember Mark everyday but to know that these young men thought about him often too brings us a great deal of comfort.Mark was the youngest of the family of nine. He showed great promise as a soccer player, playing locally for Ballynahinch Olympic and catching the eye of Norwich City.Well-liked and respected, and much loved, Katie says that her family never realised that Mark was suffering with mental health issues.Katie said: ldquoMark was an extremely engaging young man who got an A in his  plus. We called him the brain box of the family, teasing him about going to the grammar school which after the eight of us, that was quite a novelty.ldquoOur wee manrsquos funeral was one of the largest ever seen in Ballynahinch and held on New Yearrsquos Eve. If he only knew how much he was loved. It was truly heartbreaking.ldquoWhy, why, why was our overwhelming thoughts  Before Mark died, we had rarely heard of the word suicide.

He was always laughing and his friends knew him as Quinny. He loved his family and friends.Katie said that Mark was buried in his Olympic strip and his jersey number  was retired by the club shortly afterwards.Ballynahinch Olympic has continued to honour Mark every year at their awards night presenting the Mark Quinn memorial cup to the young player of the year.Katie has also made a plea for those who feel le is a struggle to talk to someone.She said: ldquoIf anyone reading this is struggling, please let someone know. Talking can make all the dference, we wish we knew then what we know now.ldquoThe pain and devastating reality of living without your son, brother, nephew or uncle truly causes physical pain. But there is also help in dealing with the loss of someone to suicide. In the early days after Markrsquos death when our faith was extremely tested, we received tremendous support from our parish community.Katie also asked for support for the upcoming football tournament at St Patrickrsquos Grammar next Saturday, September  and for Ballynahinch Olympicrsquos annual fundraising effort.She said: ldquoWe hope everyone will come along to the Red High next weekend to enjoy the football tournament. Itrsquos sure to be good day and all money raised will go to Ballynahinch counselling services and The Edge, as we feel that the Edge contributes enormously to the youth of our town. Ironically, Mark would have been  years old on September  a week after tournament.Former schoolmate, Conor MacNamara, spoke on behalf of the men involved in the fund-raising initiative.   He said: ldquoSo far the lads have raised over pound, with great support from past pupils, ex-teachers and of course Quinnyrsquos family.ldquoThese are dferent times now compared to .

However, there has been no confirmation from the inquiry of when it expects the report to be complete and unofficial suggestions of ious publication dates have consistently proved to be incorrect.Ms Bradley said she was “satisfied that the response was swt and thorough.” She added: “Given the volume of evidence gathered it was always envisaged a reasonable amount of time would be required to produce a considered final report.“I trust that when launched the depth of content will justy the time and resource directed to this critical process.”DUP’s Brexit Backstop alternative: Sinn Fein

We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Several motorists were warned about their speed but the sad thing was that two motorists received Fixed Penalty Notices for speeding.“On top of this one motorist obviously didn’t see us driving behind him when he decided to lt his mobile and start chatting to a friend instead of concentrating on the road. As a result this motorist also received a Fixed Penalty Notice for his misjudged action.“I would prefer to inform you that we had a successful day and caught nobody as it truly saddens me to issue these fixed penalty notices but some people just will not learn.“What I also noticed today was that not one person waved to us.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.

Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/dm11.jpg","title":"tech entrepreneur named catalysts innovation founder","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by Ulster Business A top tech entrepreneur has been named as Catalyst’s Innovation Founder for  by a  of leading judges.
