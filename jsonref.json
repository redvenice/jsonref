They provide all the intermediary services through which we sell advertising.\u0027Facebook are also dominant in social media with Instagram, which they own, they hold about 62 per cent, and within Facebook to a large extent you have to use Facebook advertising services. This means that advertising markets are opaque.\u0027Google have, I think, six different vertically integrated advertising services, all of which charge commissions, fees or take revenue shares, many of which are opaque, and we have to accept what terms they impose.\u0027Even the contracts that we sign to use their services are often presented to us on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.

And as of the last couple of months, the biggest apart from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Australia.\u0027It now makes more money out of advertising than our newspapers do, but we don\u0027t have any subscription revenue, or any to speak of, and the next struggle is to replace the newspaper cover price revenue, which now forms about 80 per cent of the newspaper revenue.\u0027DMG Media, which is based at Northcliffe House in Kensington, West London, also owns the Daily Mail, The Mail On Sunday, Metro and the i newspaper."},{"url":null,"title":"Weight issues increase chances developing dementia 30 research suggests","story":"Share this article Professor Andrew Steptoe, director of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing said: ‘Dementia is one of the major health challenges of the 21st century that could threaten successful aging of the population.’He added: ‘By identifying factors that may raise dementia risk that are influenced by lifestyle factors, we hope that a substantial portion... of dementia cases can be prevented through public health interventions.’Britain’s spiralling obesity crisis means two in three adults and one in three children are now overweight or obese. Researchers suggest obesity can contribute to the accumulation of amyloid proteins or lesions in the brain, responsible for some types of dementia. It can also damage blood vessels in the brain, which in turn leads to the death of brain cells, causing different parts of the brain to shrink.The findings, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, suggest dementia is the latest in a long line of health problems linked to obesity, with soaring rates of cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease also blamed on excess pounds. Lead author Dr Dorina Cadar, of UCL’s Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, said: ‘These findings provide new evidence that obesity may have important implications in terms of dementia risk. \u0027Both BMI and waist circumference status should be monitored to avoid metabolic or vascular complications.’Fiona Carragher, of the Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘Keeping active, eating well and looking after your heart health are all important steps towards reducing the risk of developing dementia later in life.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Medical research devastated Covid 19","story":"Share this article Fundraising events have been called off and charity shops have been shut for months, which has caused a \u0027big blow\u0027 to the income of charities.As a result, some research into illnesses including heart disease, cancer and Parkinson\u0027s have been put on pause.The AMRC is leading a call for the Government to commit to a matched funding agreement to put the sector on stable footing.In the first year it is calling for a cash boost of £310 million.Such a boost could put medical research \u0027back on track\u0027 and mitigate some of the risks faced by the charities, said Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of Cancer Research UK.\u0027We are facing a precipice here, we do not want to make the cuts we may be compelled to make,\u0027 she said.AMRC chief executive Aisling Burnand said: \u0027The current pandemic has put the future of charity-funded research at significant risk.\u0027The impact of the pandemic will be felt by medical research charities and their communities and their supporters for many years to come.\u0027We can see the impact of the pandemic is immediate and will have significant long-term repercussions.\u0027The AMRC said, last year, medical research charities spent an estimated £1.9billion in the UK.This year it has estimated a 41 per cent decrease spend in charity medical research.\u0027And we estimate it will take approximately four-and-a-half years for spending to return to last year\u0027s levels,\u0027 said Ms Burnand.\u0027Four-and-a-half years is a long time for anyone with a life-limiting or life-shortening condition.\u0027She added: \u0027I can\u0027t begin to express what this means for patients across the UK waiting another four-and-a-half years could be the difference between severe and non-reversible deterioration, or death. It\u0027s absolutely devastating.\u0027At the end of April almost three-quarters (74 per cent) of clinical trials and studies funded by AMRC charities had been paused.As lockdown has eased some have resumed, but the AMRC said that some will never restart.Dr Charmaine Griffiths, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation (BHF), said: \u0027We now face an unprecedented research funding crisis, one that threatens to arrest the progress made in tackling heart and circulatory diseases that sadly still kill one in four people.\u0027And we anticipate that such a sharp fall could have a catastrophic impact on UK cardiovascular research.\u0027She added: \u0027So I think the shockwaves from such a drop in funding for heart and circulatory disease will be profound and stall progress in making the discoveries that patients urgently need.\u0027The BHF is losing £10million a month at present, she added, even with support from the furlough scheme.Cancer Research UK said that the impact on cancer patients could be \u0027significant\u0027.The charity has said that it may be forced to cut £150million per year from its research funding.It said this could set back the progress made in survival for people with cancer.Ms Mitchell said: \u0027We have been massively hit by Covid-19, as our fundraising efforts have been hugely restricted. We have been doing everything possible to limit the impact. But without a way to bridge this funding gap, we will have to make radical decisions about cutting lifesaving research.\u0027Ultimately, it will be patients who will suffer the consequences, which is heartbreaking.\u0027It is imperative that the Government urgently works with medical research charities to come to a solution, so that decades of investment in UK research is not lost in a matter of months.\u0027She added: \u0027We don\u0027t want to make catastrophic cuts to research which could last a decade.\u0027Steve Ford, chief executive of Parkinson\u0027s UK, said: \u0027The pressures of this pandemic are being felt across the research world.\u0027While our agile approach has meant we have been able to continue with some of our projects, inevitably others have been put on hold and, without further investment, the future of Parkinson\u0027s research will be heavily impacted.\u0027A Department for Health and Social Care spokesman said: \u0027The UK is home to globally-recognised medical research charities, which are an integral part of our world-leading life sciences sector.\u0027We are working closely with medical research charities to understand the impact of the pandemic on the sector and identify how we can work together, ensuring patients continue benefiting from charity-funded research.\u0027It comes after a thinktank boss warned last month that as many as one in 10 charities could go out of business in the next six months due to the coronavirus pandemic.Sir Stephen Bubb, director of Charity Futures, suggested there are \u0027too many\u0027 non-profit and voluntary organisations and that more should look to merge together.His comments come as Oxfam announced it will be laying off 1,450 staff - almost a third of those on the books - as it pulls out of 18 countries around the world.Oxfam bosses revealed the drastic cuts as they came to terms with the financial fallout of the Covid-19 crisis.The charity said continuing uncertainty over how quickly countries will come out of lockdown make the financial repercussions \u0027difficult to accurately quantify\u0027.Sir Stephen told BBC Radio 4\u0027s The World At One Programme: \u0027A group of economists estimate that something like one in 10 charities will go bust in the next six months.\u0027He added: \u0027I think the public believe there are too many charities, I think that is probably true, I think we should be looking at more mergers and consolidation in our sector.\u0027This has also shown that the infrastructure for charities is incredibly weak. Donors want money to go to the front line, not on things like IT systems, and yet we need to do that.\u0027Our governance structures in some cases are antiquated, we have an ineffective regulator and the Government... frankly the relationships with Government are dire at a time when actually you would think the Government would be looking to the strength in charity in terms of motivating, organisers volunteers and community action."},{"url":null,"title":"Reopening schools fully September spread Covid 19","story":"Share this articleSubscriptions | Subscribe to The Times \u0026amp The Sunday Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/999081e6dc018965176a15448338f3fe43b9284a/0_0_5906_3543/master/5906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eedb95cf043d6cda77b4a0cbebf9af9","title":"shopping is back but not as we know it a look at the covid secure high street","story":"This week, non-essential shops in England opened their doors for the first time in months. DIY store owner Surinder Josan explains the steps that he has been taking to keep his family and his customers safeAll non-essential retailers – including clothes, shoe, toy, book and electronics shops, tailors, auction houses, photography studios and indoor markets – in England were able to reopen this week, provided they had followed UK government guidelines to make them “Covid-secure”.That means reopened shops should have carried out a risk assessment using guidance from the Health and Safety Executive. Employers also had a duty to consult staff about the safety measures required. Businesses were expected to inform all staff about the findings of their assessments, and those with more than 50 employees should have published the results on their websites.Shops should now have hygiene procedures in place to keep staff and customers safe, for instance by providing hand-washing facilities and regularly cleaning surfaces, including self-checkouts, trolleys, or devices handled by staff. Employers will also need to help those with visual impairments or disabilities to navigate these measures.It’s not only shop owners tasked with keeping customers safe. Shoppers have also been urged to protect each other by, for example, not trying on clothing or testing goods. Fitting rooms should be closed wherever possible. If they are open, contact between customers and staff should be limited. They should also be cleaned frequently, typically after each use.For many it is all new. But not for Surinder Josan who has been implementing safety measures for the past few months. Josan owns two family-run businesses in Smethwick, West Midlands: a hardware store, All Seasons DIY, started by his parents and Seasons Palace, a banqueting venue for weddings and parties.The 55-year-old grew up helping in the DIY shop and appeared to be heading down a different career path after a degree in electronics and studying for a master’s in IT. But when his father developed a heart problem while Josan was studying, he took the reins, streamlining the way the DIY shop ran and developing two thriving businesses.The whole family has been involved – including his wife, his mother, his father until he died a few years ago, and even his children when they’re not studying. “We like to be right in the thick of things so we run them both. With the venue it’s actually pretty easy – we just take the bookings and direct people to our suppliers like caterers, DJs, the people who do the decorations.The detail is taken off our hands. Plus, the main use of that is at the weekend and evenings when the shop isn’t open, so I can jump from one to the other.” When Josan started hearing about the coronavirus in late December, he admits to being scared.“The first thing that came to mind was that the banqueting venue was not going to work in those circumstances.” So, in late Januaryearly February, he took the decision to close the 200-person venue, persuading customers to move their bookings to 2021. While the loss of income was a hit, he decided the move was in the best interests of everyone’s safety.He was then faced with deciding what to do about the shop. “The biggest problem is that my mother’s DNA is part of the shop, and asking her to step away from it was a big no-no. The only way to get her away was to close. So when they announced that pubs and schools were all closed we bit the bullet and shut it too.”Putting the time to good use, he decided to carry out a shop refit, but put notices up saying if anyone needed hardware items for repairs or urgent work, he would help. It started with a few phone calls, he says, but soon there was a steady stream of people wanting to buy things. “It also dawned on us that hardware stores were allowed to remain open, so we thought: ‘If we’re going to do this, we will have to do it properly.’”That decision prompted Josan and his family to put an array of measures in place to keep both themselves and their customers safe. “We put lines outside the shop. We also barricaded the area by the till so customers come in one by one, tell us what they want, then we go and get it. We reduced the contactless payments minimum from £5 to £1 to make it easier for people to limit contact. We also started cleaning the money using wipes.”The measures weren’t necessarily easy, but were well-received by customers filled with confidence that Josan was doing everything he could to keep them safe. “It was hard work – we were constantly going backwards and forwards – I think I did 17,000 steps in one day and that was just in the shop.“It was so tiring that we cut down our hours, so instead of opening from 9am to 7pm we opened from 10am to 4.30pm. The number of customers who’ve come in and complimented us is unbelievable. They say that when they come here they feel really safe. We did it because we wanted to be safe, but it works for everyone.”While many businesses will be getting used to new practices and ways of working, Josan and his family have few changes planned for the immediate future, being happy to continue with the safety measures they’ve been using for the past few months.“We’re going to carry on doing exactly what we have been doing up until now,” he says. Despite that, he remains concerned that not everyone is as careful with their safety as he and his fellow retailers are.“People have calmed down and there’s less panic-buying, but they aren’t observing the 2-metre rule. They’re just a bit absent-minded about it,” he adds.And while he plans on keeping things as they are for the DIY store, potentially until the end of the year, Josan admits the future is less clear for the banqueting venue.“If the government says we can open, I have thought about how I would do it and keep people separate. You could do it with the tables, with the toilets, and the kitchen and even the stage. But how do you do it on a dance floor? Unless you draw circles and tell people to stay inside them.“So the only way I can think of is that instead of having 200 people you have 60-70, and use more of the outdoors as opposed to the indoors. These are some of my thoughts, but I have got to do it so we are safe and whoever is with us – the caterers, the guests – are safe too. The last thing I want is for there to be an outbreak.”In the meantime, he plans to offer the space to a local school free of charge if it needs more room in order to welcome children back. With so much adjustment needed for the “new normal” when it comes to our shops and venues, Josan acknowledges that it can be confusing. But he says there is a lot of information available, both from the UK government and other organisations, to help business owners put the right measures in place to keep themselves, their staff and their customers safe. And while he is confident that he’s been doing his bit to make sure his customers aren’t put in harm’s way, he admits the future is uncertain.“This is a new normal – we’re not going to go back to what we had for some time yet. There are still so many unknowns. At the end of the day, this virus is going to take out people who are close to us. It isn’t good enough to only think of our businesses and economy.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

With women only allowed to have one birth partner and home births restricted for a time, I spoke to women and men about how having a baby during lockdown has been for them and their new families. The project is ongoing.”Misgalla lives in south London and has been a doula for 4 years. She’s currently supporting Cath, who has undergone solo IVF, via Zoom.“I’ll be Cath’s birth partner, I’ve been supporting her since November.

Once I’d decided, it all happened pretty quickly. A friend and I got pizza and a bottle of prosecco one night and went through the website.“Michele and I did a lot of the preparation together and she was there during the birth, looking after me.“Gaspar looks just like his cousin Jude when he was a baby, he feels like a total Rooney.

We Zoom with them every few days.”Kara has been a doula since 2017, supporting Becky and her daughter Silver, four weeks old, who live in Wirral.“I started supporting Becky on the day of her C-section, from when she went to hospital to immediately after the birth. Mums need a lot more support in the first week, then it gradually tapers off. Hopefully I’ll get to visit when lockdown’s over. It’ll be lovely to see them in person.”Thando has been a doula for seven years, supporting women around London and Bristol and attending hundreds of births.“It was horrible not being able to attend Colleen and Joe’s birth. I spoke to them on video call, but environment is everything in birth – you need intimacy and privacy.

Thando has been their doula since February. McKeever and Mae were in hospital for eight days following her birth.Weber: “Mae was in intensive care for the first few days because she had jaundice. We’d meet up in NICU during the day, then Colleen would go back to her room and I’d come home and play Nintendo. I delivered supplies to Colleen in the days after. We could meet downstairs but not with Mae. Colleen held her up to the window for me.”Emily de Groot and Rashid Ariori with twins Maya and Joshua, born 21 March“My mum was going to come for a couple of weeks to help – that’s been hard because our families haven’t met them yet.

At the moment my local hospital have suspended their home birthing service. They should be up and running again by the end of June, so hopefully the baby waits!“I had a socially distanced baby shower. I saw balloons and then suddenly this convoy of cars started coming down the road! We played games, everyone was guessing the sex of the baby, we had a bit of music, sweets. That was probably the nearest to having a social connection with people. It was a surprise, I really appreciated it.”Reyhan Akyıldız-Gladstone, 31, Jack Gladstone, 30, and Aphra, born 16 MarchAkyıldız-Gladstone: “We had Aphra at home 10 days before they shut down the local home birth team. She was born at 9am on the day everyone started working from home. I was quite aware that everyone was around in their houses! I went into labour at 4.30am and by 10am we were in bed and everyone had gone. Everything happened at a crazy pace.“We have no idea when our parents are going to meet her. My dad lives in Turkey – he had flights to come over but they were cancelled.“It’s had advantages, getting to know her and her getting to know us. The three of us have our little routine.”James Dow, 36, and Juliet Cochrane, 34, east London, who are expecting a girl on 21 JuneCochrane: “It’s definitely going to be different. The grandparents and siblings will have to self-isolate for two weeks when she’s born, and even then they might not be able to hold her. They might, it’s so hard to know what the right thing to do is. There’s a real plus side in slowing down and having time to really plan and get things organised. It’s quite good for us as a family.”Nilufar Anwar, 35, Johan Bjerke, 38, and baby Alma, born 13 AprilAnwar: “At hospital, my midwife’s name was Rachel. I wouldn’t be able to recognise her again as she wore a mask the whole time. It’s strange to go through such an intimate, intense, life-changing experience with someone you can’t really see. I would have loved to have given her a hug. But the pandemic has given us time to do nothing but adore every move and sound that Alma makes, and slowly grow into our new role as parents.”Raquel Ruiz Tognetti, 40, with baby Leonardo, born 20 April“I’m a solo 40-year-old mum, and had a complicated delivery in the worst weeks of the pandemic. My parents were supposed to come and help, but they were stuck in lockdown in Venezuela. In hospital you could feel the fear in everyone. Since the delivery, things have been much better, but I’ve been weighing my baby at home as the midwife visits stopped. Sometimes I think Leonardo thinks I’m the only human on earth.”Helen Ward, 35, and Oli Evans, 37, with daughters Emily, 4, and Erin, born 19 MarchWard: “We feel a lot calmer now. the start of this was insane. I was so anxious, crying all the time, really stressed. Now Erin’s putting on weight, I feel better about things. Emily has been remarkably fine. So far only Oli’s sister has met Erin, no one else. Friends have come for distanced drive-by drinks and cuppas so they’ve only seen her from afar. The experience has been otherworldly at times. Erin isn’t registered with a birth certificate yet, so coupled with no one meeting her, it’s almost as if she doesn’t exist.”“It’s nerve-racking taking the bus to maternity appointments. Even though you have a mask on and other people have a mask on, you still feel on edge. My partner can’t come to any scans, so we’ve booked a private 4D one so he can see her.“I’ve mostly been worried about the baby when she’s here, I’m not worried about myself. I think her grandparents can meet her with a mask, not touch. Maybe everyone can meet her around Christmastime. Hopefully it’s over by Christmas!”Sherica Spence, 34, and baby Caleb, born 4 March“The morning we checked out of hospital, I heard them say they had two confirmed cases of coronavirus. I just wanted to go home. We saw family and friends for the two weeks before lockdown, but after that we couldn’t see anyone. Everyone made sure we had food in the house: toilet rolls, nappies and wipes.“That was weird, having to rely on people. I’m a person that does everything myself. Celeb’s dad thought he might have the coronavirus, so he was at his house, doing video calls, making sure we were OK. I’m just lucky that he’s a peaceful child. He’s so good!”Lena Buhler, 31, and Johnson Aboaba, 27, due 1 SeptemberBuhler: “We were supposed to travel for work over March, April and May, but that was all cancelled. The hardest thing is not having a routine – that can make you feel a bit lost. My mum would have come over from Switzerland during this time but instead she’s been ordering baby stuff to the house. After the initial worry and anxiety subsided, I’ve found this to be good for us as a couple. Johnson’s been good. It’s a strange time for him but he’s been very calm.”Nissa Moger, 36, with baby Indy, born on 8 April“Indy was born in hospital and we were home 12 hours later. We were planning a water birth at home, but at that time they’d stopped the service, so we went in. It wasn’t what I planned, but the midwives were brilliant.“I work at St Thomas’ on the labour ward as a midwife and I teach hypnobirthing. All the classes moved online in March as soon as they said mums were at risk. It’s worked really well. I think initially my clients were more anxious because it was the unknown, but they seem more settled now.”Tammy Woodhouse, 30, and Adam Woodhouse, 28, due 9 AugustTammy: “They announced the lockdown the night of our 20-week scan, so off we went to our appointment. There were signs up, but we didn’t really read them, we just went up, and they told Adam he couldn’t be there. We had no idea. I just sat in the waiting room crying! It was a shock.“They let me FaceTime Adam in the appointment, but it turned out I had my hand over the microphone the whole time! In the first trimester I was sick quite a lot, but the second one’s been an absolute dream. I’m a little bit sad I had to spend it indoors.“I’ve deleted all my news apps – that was probably the best thing. I think it was just watching the numbers go up and up and feeling completely helpless.”Esther and Shahin Najafipour, both 31, with baby Milo, born 21 MayEsther: “I was in hospital for two days when I had him. No visitors were allowed. I work as a costume maker for film and had made 85 pairs of scrubs for the local hospitals while I was on furlough. Some of the nurses were wearing ones from the same batch. The midwife that delivered him was wearing some.”Shahin: “Normally, I would get two weeks’ paternity leave, so I’d go back next week, which doesn’t seem that much. It was kind of a blessing to be home as well and help where needed.”Farah Habibi, 28, and Faisal Imadi, 27, two-year-old Araaz and baby Zaayan, born 6 MarchHabibi: “Zayaan was born two weeks before the lockdown. My mum stayed for two weeks, then I sent her home. She would usually have stayed with me a lot longer. We FaceTime with her and my sister everyday.“My sister’s been dropping food outside the flat for us. We were self-isolating with him, but I’ve started going in the garden now. Today was the first proper walk I did with Araaz – he mostly goes out with his dad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11fa43710d551127f18faa36836202b8acb87672/0_187_1200_719/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=747b52bf4ad73dcc183fc5cc3fedc907","title":"great british art quiz perth museum and art gallery","story":"Perth Museum and Art Gallery set today’s quiz, which enables you to explore the art collections of British museums closed due to Covid-19 – while answering some fiendish questions along the wayThis quiz is brought to you in collaboration with Art UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues by 45,000 artists.

But if not, examine the evidence, come and see our test sites and let us open.”The UK has more than 7,000 gyms and leisure centres, with around two-thirds run privately and the rest by councils or operators on their behalf. With 10.4m memberships, it is an £8bn-a-year industry that employs about 190,000 people.“We are confident we can provide a safe place to workout,” continued Cobbold who said the fitness industry had drawn up detailed safety protocols as far back as May. “Through our existing electronic entry system, we know the names and details of every single member in our facilities at any moment.”Although outdoor gyms are allowed to reopen on 4 July alongside hotels and other parts of the hospitality sector, indoor sites are categorised as “close proximity” venues, which the government deems too risky for now. That list extends to nightclubs, soft-play areas, swimming pools, spas, bowling alleys and water parks.While the prime minister said it was people’s “patriotic duty” to return to pubs, which are to reopen on 4 July, there was widespread consternation that sporting facilities had not been allowed to start up again despite months of intensive planning.There is still no date for club cricket to resume, even though it appears to be a naturally physically distanced game, with the hiatus putting huge pressure on inidual club finances. “At the moment we’re still working on ways to make cricket more covid-secure, but we can’t change the guidance yet,” Boris Johnson said on Tuesday.The economic crisis triggered by the pandemic is testing the partnerships between local authorities and leisure operators, typically charitable trusts, which run gyms and swimming pools on their behalf. On Tuesday, Nick Bitel, the chair of Sport England, warned that the longer venues remained closed the “greater the danger to their ability to survive financially”.“With the first leisure trust collapsing last week in Peterborough, this is a real and growing risk, with public leisure providers a particularly deep concern because so many of those operators provide activities for disadvantaged groups,” said Bitel.However, later on in the day the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, provided hope that the fitness industry might not have much longer to wait, tweeting the government’s “aspiration is to reopen gyms and leisure facilities in mid-July”.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media \u0026amp Sport, said: “We are continuing to work with representatives from the gym and leisure centre sectors on plans for a safe, phased reopening with the ambition for this to happen from mid-July, subject to public health guidance. “We need to make sure that plans are comprehensive with all risks minimised. We are fully committed to making sure the public can exercise and stay healthy, as outlined in our guidance for outdoor exercise.”But for other parts of the industry the “nightmare of enforced closure goes on”, says Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association. Many of its members, including nightclubs and pubs and restaurants that are unable to comply with physical distancing – were in dire straits, Kill said, and needed additional financial support from the government.In another apparent inconsistency, while the country’s hairdressers will be back in action – with appropriate precautions, including the use of face visors, in place – on 4 July, consumers will have to wait longer for a manicure or facial as beauty salons and nail bars have been told to remain closed. The government would only allow these “close contact” services to restart when it was confident they could operate in a “covid-secure way”, Johnson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa7b4a9222d5229f098e31cddaa5afc446aad7b1/0_0_3014_1808/master/3014.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=d830aaad63d048e5ee50c5f7b6b10bc7","title":"how did wildlife groups start collaborating in the destruction of nature ","story":"We need strong campaigns to confront environmental collapse. Instead, we get weakness and complicityOut of this horror comes hope. In the backwash of the pandemic’s first wave, we see the shingled ruins of the old economy, and the chance to construct a new one. As we rebuild our economic life, we should do it on green principles, averting a crisis many times greater than the coronavirus: climate breakdown and the collapse of our life-support systems.This means no more fossil fuel-based infrastructure. Even existing infrastructure, according to climate scientists, could push us past crucial thresholds. It means an end to megaprojects whose main purpose is enriching construction companies.Even before the pandemic struck, this megalomaniac scheme was in trouble due to the strength of public opposition. The pandemic, some of us assumed, would be the death blow. Why would the government spend money on this grandiose nonsense when there are so many other priorities?It’s one of the most outrageous exercises in greenwashing I’ve ever seen. But I haven’t told you the worst of it. This guff was not published by the government or the housebuilding companies. It was published by a consortium of wildlife groups: the RSPB, the Woodland Trust and the region’s two wildlife trusts. All of them once fought the Arc and its associated developments. The Wildlife Trusts once mounted a legal challenge to the expressway. This looks to me like a switch from opposition to collaboration.There’s a remarkable, distressing similarity between the wildlife groups’ campaign and Highways England’s own PR materials. The groups use the same dismal, instrumental language. They call nature “natural capital”. They rebrand nature reserves and woodlands as “green infrastructure”. They uncritically deploy one of the most controversial concepts in development planning: “net gain”. This is the principle that established wildlife habitats destroyed by a project should be replaced by a greater area of new habitat. It has been used repeatedly as an excuse to destroy ancient and precious wild places, replacing them with uniform saplings in plastic guards. Government newspeak appears to have framed their language and shaped their thinking.Both the wildlife trusts in this consortium, in response to my questions, tell me they have applied for funds from Highways England for other projects. The boundaries blur and the objectives mesh, until it seems hard to tell the difference between protectors and destroyers. But I don’t think this is about money. I think it’s about power.The four groups all tell me that, despite the statements in their press materials, they still oppose the housing target. They say they want to lay down green principles for construction in the Arc and ensure it “respects environmental limits”. But by rebranding the Arc as the potential saviour of nature, I believe they are playing straight into the government’s hands.To make matters worse, people in local campaign groups who have been leading the fight against the Oxford-Cambridge Arc say they were not consulted. Deborah Lovatt of the Buckinghamshire Expressway Action Group tells me she had no idea Nature’s Arc was coming. “When I saw that they were describing this scale of destruction as ‘a perfect opportunity’, I felt sick.” They have “completely undermined community campaigns”, she says. This is ironic, as one of the many complaints against the government’s proposal is the lack of public consultation.The bigger and more established an organisation becomes the more timid and conformist it seems to get, until it’s almost indistinguishable from the interests it should be confronting. In this age of environmental crisis and collapse, of government lies and corporate power, we need our nature defenders to rise like lions after slumber. Instead, they queue at the abattoir gate like sedated lambs.As commercial propaganda seeps into every corner of public life, trust collapses. No one knows what or whom to believe. We need campaigning groups that stand on principle, mobilise their members, use their own words and think their own thoughts. Instead, they swing in the winds of power."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d559f02fdf3a39bd731b7be05735be5f4039f1e/0_201_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a06960ff9a0952c357ed428987b8b247","title":"back to class how to study from home as a mature student","story":"Whether you’ve been furloughed and want to retrain or just fancy studying a new interest, the experts discuss your optionsIt’s been nearly three months since lockdown started in the UK and many people are wondering what to do next. If you’re thinking of\u0026nbspgoing back to university, then you are not alone: the number of first year undergraduate students aged 21 and over\u0026nbsplooks set to be rising. According to\u0026nbspUcas, mature applicants have risen in 2020 and people in the 30-34 age group have increased for the first time in five years.Whether you’ve been furloughed and you want to retrain, or you simply want to pick up an interest you didn’t have time for in the past, a return to education\u0026nbspcould be a sensible move. Whether it’s for a short course or a full degree, here are some tips on how to make a success of it:If you’re worried about committing to a full degree, many universities now offer short courses. Places like the Open University also have free courses available that can give you a flavour of a subject. Most are around eight weeks long and some have a fee for the certificate at the end.“It’s a really good use of people’s time, especially\u0026nbspif they’re struggling with lockdown,” says Damon Miller, associate lecturer at the Open University, who advises looking at online reviews and comparison sites. “Even if you just wanted\u0026nbspto have a taste of online learning and then go to a campus uni afterwards, short courses are a good way to see what works for you.”One of the key struggles for mature students can be establishing and maintaining the sense of themselves as a student when they typically have many different hats to wear. “Sometimes I wonder why I’m doing this,” says Eddie Thompson*, 57, who is doing a creative writing MA at the University of Derby. Although he lives alone and has the space and time to study, Thompson says he has to force himself to do the work. “I do it\u0026nbspin bitesize\u0026nbspchunks,” he says. “But it’s provided an escape and, actually, it’s quite lovely.”James Brunton from Dublin City University, whose research focuses on off-campus learning, says people should actively remind themselves why they began their studies and what goals they are working towards. “Keep communicating with fellow students and lecturers, so that your identity as a learner remains an ongoing part of your life and does not fade into the background,” he says.Thompson says this works for him. “There are times when I catch myself saying, ‘I’m a student, really?’ But I try to stay in touch with the original goal, because it’s still valid.”Adult learners often have difficulties managing their studies alongside other commitments. This is likely to be exacerbated by the current crisis, but being organised will help. Create a daily routine and maintain some flexibility. Use planners, calendars, diaries and to-do lists, and negotiate time and space to study with those around you.\u0026nbspJudith Harper, 60, did a degree in youth and childhood studies while being a foster carer of six. Fitting it all round the children is hard, she says, so work out the best time\u0026nbspof day to study and stick to a routine. “For me, it was after the children were in bed when I knew I was unlikely to be disturbed.”Liz Fox, 36, who is studying social psychology and runs her own cake business, says it’s important to plan ahead. “I book in times to study and I recognise which days tend to be for business.”Having a designated study area puts you in the right head space for work. You don’t need an entire room, just a space somewhere where all the books are so you don’t go round the house looking for them.Miller says if you’re in a house with other people it can be “exceedingly annoying”, but find a space, even if it’s the kitchen table, and clear it for a period of time, even if that means studying alongside kids.\u0026nbspJacob Polden, 27, is studying computing and IT while working for a software company. Since he is able to study outside of the house during lockdown, he makes sure his work area is not the same as his unwinding space. Without that, he says it is difficult to switch off and “it feels like you’re forever working”.\u0026nbspStudying from a distance is very different to being in a class and it can be very isolating. With the face-to-face meetings and informal chats gone for the time being, you may find yourself in a situation where you think you’re on your own, but you will have tutors, support networks and fellow students, and they are all going through the same thing.Contact time may be low on many courses, but pastoral services are good at offering advice – particularly if you fall behind. Thompson thinks you may be pleasantly surprised at what’s on offer. “There may be a lack of contact time but support services are fantastic. If you know who and where to ask there is tonnes of support,” he says.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3d14c969d0a8c63287fd13ed4b3ebe773bf499e/0_95_5390_3236/master/5390.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3a4d3f366c3650b22427996d410a257","title":"fashion graduates have a unique opportunity to make retail sustainable","story":"The coronavirus pandemic is changing what we want from fashion, and new graduates have the skills to make it happenThe lockdown should have been online retailing’s chance to shine, but distribution centres weren’t set up for social distancing and some stores had to close their websites down temporarily. Now shops have reopened, retailers are working around the clock to ensure they can carry on trading if trouble hits again. This presents a unique opportunity for fashion graduates.For fashion businesses, hiring young talent means tapping into the latest retailing knowledge – and post-pandemic, this will be more crucial than ever. In recent years, we have seen a massive shift in the way fashion courses are taught: there is an increased emphasis on the importance of technology and its role from supply chain to shop floors, as well as broader scientific skills.This was an effort to keep pace with the changing face of retail and the challenge to the high street from online. The latest cohort of fashion students is the most technological yet, making them way ahead of the game in terms of what the industry needs. It will be data analysts, web designers, online marketers, social media copywriters and supply chain architects who make the biggest impact. The retail graduates of 2020 are already equipped with these skills.Fashion graduates may feel stuck in a period of uncertainty, having seen their studies catapulted from the campus into their front rooms. But the good news is that forward-thinking fashion businesses will already be looking to them to meet the challenges of a post-Covid-19 world.With the rise of online shopping and “multi-channel” experiences, the ability to code, analyse data to reveal trends and buying habits, and the know-how to turn supply chains into well choreographed retail ballets will be crucial.Fashion brands will also need scientific, probing minds to develop new, environmentally-friendly fibres to meet the emerging purchasing habits of more green-conscious customers. Pre-pandemic, sustainable fashion was already gaining a lot of traction, and this is expected to increase further post-crisis.As the industry is rethinking supply chain models and hurtling towards digital transformation, it is clear that fashion brands simply cannot afford to ignore recent graduates.Fashion colleges can help students bridge the ide between education and vocation. Colleges need to improve the access potential employers have to students, inviting them in to meet undergraduates well before the end of their courses.Vocational centres of learning have a very symbiotic relationship with the fashion industry – the Fashion Retail Academy itself was created ultimately by a coalition of retailers – and neither will recover without the other. The pandemic’s great legacy for fashion could be a working relationship between industry, students and recent graduates that is closer than ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8523985c652c92b76797f1159014415a8c70afe6/0_156_5283_3170/master/5283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbeb68529b42d8b41541d7e05fec0b71","title":"my land is now owned by lions maasai farmers offer kenya wildlife a lifeline aoe","story":"Parsaloi Kupai’s home, situated on the edge of Ol Kinyei conservancy near the Maasai Mara game reserve, is no different from any other Maasai homestead – oval-shaped huts with an almost flat roof and walls plastered with a mixture of water, mud and cow dung. At the centre of the homestead is a cattle boma, an enclosure where his livestock spends the night, safe from the many predators that roam the area.Kupai, 47, and his two wives chose to live here after they surrendered 69 hectares (170 acres) of land to the 7,500-hectare conservancy. He is among 240 landowners who gave up their highly valued grazing land for the project.“I cannot graze on that land any more,” he tells me, pointing to a hill far into the horizon, the outer reaches of the conservancy. “It is now owned by elephants, wildebeests and lions.”In 2018, Ol Kinyei achieved IUCN Green List status for its good governance, sound design and planning and effective management.Michiel Veldhuis, lead author of the study from the University of Groningen, concluded: “There is an urgent need to rethink how we manage the boundaries of protected areas to be able to conserve bioersity. The future of the world’s most iconic protected area and their associated human population may depend on it.”Communities around the national reserve were driving their livestock further into protected areas. This encroachment, coupled with a lack of clear strategy by the government, has brought wildlife conservation to a crossroads.The conservancy model, Kaelo says, is one way to tilt this imbalance, and in the greater Mara region, more than 14,000 landowners have embraced the idea by forming 15 conservancies that offer close to 142,000 hectares of refuge to wild animals. Apart from Ol Kinyei, other conservancies in greater Mara include Naboisho, Olare Motorogi, Lemek, Mara North, and Siana.Landowners in a conservancy identify a tourism operator willing to set up a safari camp within the new block of land. The operator benefits from tailor-made safaris since a conservancy has a higher concentration of wild animals owing to enlarged rangelands. Funds derived from conservation and accommodation fees and philanthropy are shared between the operator and landowners at an agreed percentage.Kupai receives Ksh20,000 (£193) every month for the land he surrendered to Ol Kinyei conservancy, money that he invests in livestock and his children’s education.Critics, however, ask whether setting up community-based conservancies is the best form of land use, as opposed to farming or raising livestock. Some landowners have protested over what they see as skewed agreements between them and tourism operators, with the latter being accused of making huge profits at the expense of landowners.In their defence, conservancy proponents argue that both agriculture and livestock-keeping heavily depend on adequate rainfall, something that is in short supply around the Mara. In addition, they say the soil in the area is too rocky for any meaningful form of farming to take place, and that mechanised farming is too expensive for the many small landholders.“Ideally, a conservancy is a commercial venture and an alternative form of land use to the local Maasai,” says Simon Nkoitoi, the senior warden and manager at Ol Kinyei Conservancy. “The economic benefits derived from this form of wildlife conservation outweigh other commercial ventures, otherwise the local Maasai would not trade their grazing fields for wildlife conservation.”Ol Kinyei was set up in 2005, partly due to the efforts of Jake Grieves-Cook, a veteran of the local tour industry who has worked in sustainable tourism for more than 40 years. His tour operations outfit, Gamewatchers Safaris, operates camps in a number of conservancies in Kenya, including Ol Kinyei.Operators like Gamewatchers must adhere to strict tourism regulations laid out by the group conservancy management. As an example, there can only be a single tent per 700 acres and no more than 12 tents per camp. Low tourism densities in such conservancies mean the few guests have access to thousands of acres, increasing the chances of a memorable wildlife experience. The carbon footprint is kept to a bare minimum.The economic benefits of a conservancy go beyond the land-leasing fees paid out to landowners. In the largely rural settings where conservancies are located, safari camps have created job opportunities for youths who now work as camp managers, drivers and tour guides, housekeepers and chefs.Nkoitoi is part of the conservancy management team. His role includes overseeing a team of 19 rangers charged with securing this vast piece of wild Africa. A smartphone app known as Wild (Wildlife Information Landscape Database) assists Nkoitoi and his team in collating wildlife numbers and their location, information that is then transmitted to the conservancy rangers’ post. The application also helps map out possible human-wildlife conflict hotspots. In the greater Mara ecosystem, such conflicts are not in short supply and continue to test the fragile coexistence between local communities and wildlife.Sitting under a giant yellow-backed acacia, Nkoitoi’s phone rings. On the other end is a ranger who informs him of an elephant incursion into a human settlement. “We will check it out in the morning,” he tells the caller. “If we don’t address such issues in time, those people can take matters in their hands,” he says after hanging up. “They can get trampled by the elephants as they try to chase them away.”The following morning, Nkoitoi visits the village, Ereyiet Oltome, located on the eastern edge of Ol Kinyei. Tempers are high following the invasion of elephants. Several homesteads stand a few metres from a thicket where more than a dozen elephants are holed up. The previous day, an elephant had chased a young man who, in a bid to distract his pursuer, threw his traditional wraparound to the ground. “Look! This is what the elephant did to his shuka,” a young man says, holding the tattered cloth belonging to his friend who was too traumatised to venture outdoors. He was fortunate. Some don’t live to relate a close encounter with an elephant.Nkoitoi is soon joined by Marc Goss, head of the rapid response unit at Mara Elephant Project. The villagers are relieved to hear the roar of his helicopter, a sound they have heard before when elephants have invaded their farms. For hours, Goss tries every trick in the book to drive the elephants back to the conservancy. “It is tricky driving elephants out of the private fields,” he says during a break in the operation. “They are clever animals. Mothers will never leave their young behind. Some even go under the helicopter to avoid detection from the air.”By 2pm, a handful have been driven back to the confines of the conservancy. “At least we tried. We did our best,” says Goss. The operation was set to continue next day.Elephant incursions into human settlements are a new phenomenon around Maasai Mara. While the conservancies have increased the land under wildlife conservation, communities on the borderlines have fenced off blocks of land partly to preserve the grass for livestock. Grazing is allowed in some conservancies and outlawed in others. Elephants are attracted by the lush grass within the fenced-off areas.Despite the periodic conflicts between wild animals and humans, there is general agreement that the conservancy model is the way to go in preserving what most of the world has lost.With funding for the conservation model disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has prevented thousands of foreign tourists who would have trooped to the Mara to watch the annual wildebeest migration, a number of emergency fund appeals have been launched. For example, £44,867 has been raised to support local communities and protect endangered wildlife in Mara Naboisho conservancy, while Gamewatchers is urging donors to adopt an acre of land for a year with a donation to the Wildlife Habitat Trust, a fund set up to help to pay the wages of staff working in the conservancies as well as the land leases.The Kenyan government has also announced it is setting aside 2bn Kenyan shillings (£15m) in the coming financial year (starting July 1) to support wildlife conservancies. “We have hope that wildlife will flourish,” says Kaelo of the conservancy model. “This will happen if investment in our national parks and reserves is quadrupled and private landowners and local communities are effectively incentivised to ensure wildlife is perceived as a national asset.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b0006d04708ed5f45e4bb1c139d6b4c854efb12/0_311_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22537d032f6d562fb4183da6f694dd2a","title":"tackle uk carbon emissions by working with nature government urged","story":"‘Restoring nature needs to be given top priority,’ says Craig Bennett, Wildlife Trusts CEO Restoring the natural environment could absorb as much as a third of the UK’s carbon dioxide emissions, making the government’s target of net zero emissions by 2050 much easier to meet, according to green campaigners.Returning degraded peatland and bog to its natural state, cultivating marine meadows of seagrass, restoring salt marshes and wetlands, and taking some grasslands out of cultivation, as well as planting more trees, all contribute to creating carbon sinks, which absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.Craig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, urged the government to restore degraded areas in order to tackle both the climate crisis and the collapse of wildlife populations and habitats around the UK.“Nature in the UK is in a sorry state and important habitats are damaged and declining,” he said. “Efforts to cut our emissions must be matched with determined action to fix our broken ecosystems so they can help stabilise our climate. Restoring nature in the UK needs to be given top priority.”The government’s pledge to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 is under close scrutiny this week, as the first anniversary approaches of the pledge being signed into law. The government’s statutory climate advisers, the committee on climate change, will publish a progress report on Thursday on the government’s efforts to reach net zero, and call for a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis.On Wednesday, the Institute for Public Policy Research will call for a Royal Commission on preparations for environmental breakdown. The thinktank will warn that climate breakdown, the poor state of the natural environment around the UK, pollution and our unsustainable use of natural resources – both from the UK and in the goods and services we import from abroad – were all contributing to a growing crisis that could overtake the country.In its report, based on a year of research, the IPPR concluded that the UK stood on the brink of environmental breakdown. The authors drew parallels with the coronavirus pandemic and called for new legislation in the form of a sustainable economy act, which would set targets for cutting environmental damage. A minister should also be appointed to oversee the effort, the thinktank said.Laurie Laybourn-Langton, associate fellow at IPPR, said: “It’s becoming increasingly clear that the UK was not adequately prepared for the coronavirus pandemic. The threats posed by the environmental crisis could also emerge quickly and could overwhelm our capacity to respond.”The UK’s environment could also come under threat from post-Brexit trade agreements, warned the Aldersgate Group of sustainable business leaders in a new report. New trade deals must take into account the imperatives of the net zero target, as well as the government’s pledges not to dilute the UK’s environmental protections after Brexit, and the need for British businesses to avoid being undermined by foreign competitors that do not uphold such high standards, according to the report.Farmers face particular concerns over trade deals with the US, as the government’s pledges that no chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef will be allowed into the UK do not extend to other animal welfare and food safety standards. Ministers must ensure that as a minimum future trade deals should exclude any provisions that would create obstacles to the UK’s sovereign right to regulate in the public interest and to apply regulations to all participants in the UK market, the report found."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ff95247a1ddeffceef53f2bb0a1e68d44d57286/0_428_4341_2605/master/4341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1368495f261919e0c761c1798e4eba82","title":"uks net zero pledge what has been achieved one year on","story":"The urgency of the climate emergency has grown but there has been little progress so farLast summer, Theresa May signed into law the UK’s ground-breaking target of hitting net zero carbon emissions by 2050 against a backdrop of increasingly vocal Extinction Rebellion protests, school climate strikes and Brexit-related political turmoil within the Conservative party.It was one of the last acts of a beleaguered prime minister, under fire after a series of missteps and haemorrhaging support in party and country. Protesters lined the streets, businesses despaired at the lack of leadership and the government seemed to have little strategy for extricating the country from its immediate travails, let alone a viable long-term vision.Since then, Britain has been transformed by the coronavirus crisis, with the economy mired in the deepest recession for centuries and braced for a possible second wave of infections. But while the skies have cleared and carbon emissions plunged during the lockdown, the urgency of the climate emergency has only grown.As the first anniversary looms this Saturday of the signing of the net zero pledge into law, there has been little concrete action, and no clear roadmap on how to meet the goal.Asked by the  what measures had been taken on net zero in the past year, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) cited only: John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “If the government wants businesses, local authorities and households to make the appropriate investments over the next decade, they will need confidence that Britain really is committed to decarbonising the economy. But the practical measures taken by the government over the past 12 months add up to a tiny fraction of what is needed to keep us on course to meet that commitment.”The UK was one of the first countries to enshrine in law a net zero target for carbon dioxide. That leadership helped the UK gain host status for the crucial next round of UN climate talks, called Cop26, and the target – endorsed by all the major parties in last year’s general election – was intended to galvanise action across government and spur business investment.The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:• Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.• Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.• Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\u0026nbsp • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050.• Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels. The law was passed amid political turmoil over Brexit, followed by Boris Johnson’s landslide victory in last December’s general election. The subsequent redrawing of the political map was still in progress, and the reshuffled cabinet still bedding in, when the coronavirus pandemic struck early this year. These upheavals forced the postponement of Cop26 to next year, and have also, according to insiders, stalled new climate policy.Progress has been slow on key fronts, however. Billions of pounds spent to bail out airlines, carmakers and oil companies have come without green strings attached. Home heating is the biggest source of emissions from households, but there is still no strategy for insulating Britain’s draughty homes, despite clear evidence that doing so would provide thousands of “shovel-ready” green jobs. Switching from gas boilers to low-carbon alternatives is essential, but at the replacement rate the government proposes, it would take 1,500 years, according to Friends of the Earth.“To see this kind of foot-dragging so early on is hugely concerning,” said Jamie Peters, the campaigns director at FoE.Investors want to see more direction from the top, to spur private capital into low-carbon projects, while businesses want more regulation that provides clear signals that private investors will follow, as well as support for large-scale trials of new technologies, such as hydrogen fuel and carbon capture and storage. But while many are prepared to cut ministers some slack for having to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, the government’s political opponents say the delay shows an unwillingness to take the drastic steps needed.Matthew Pennycook, the shadow climate change minister, said: “Setting a target is one thing, hitting it is quite another. As things stand, not only are the government failing to do anything like enough to meet our legally binding net zero target, they are not even on track to meet the less ambitious one that preceded it.” Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem climate emergency spokesperson, said: “Without a plan to cut emissions, the Conservatives’ pledges fall far short of the action we need.” There must be clear focus on a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis, added Caroline Lucas, the Green Party MP. “This really is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to put us on the path to a greener, fairer future. Going back to business as usual would be a one-way street to climate disaster.”A spokesperson for BEIS said: “Tackling climate change is a national priority, which is why the UK was the first major economy to commit to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. We have proven that green growth is possible, and our track record of driving down emissions while growing our economy and supporting our world-leading renewable and low-carbon sectors will see us go further and faster in the years ahead.”The government will be under the spotlight later this week when its statutory adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, produces a progress report on Thursday on the UK’s emissions-cutting efforts. The CCC will recommend a green recovery, for which there are indications of public support, and the government must make a formal response.Ahead of the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s pre-budget statement, thought to be slated for 6 July, ministers must show that warm words will be backed up by action, experts said. “There are encouraging signs that the government is beginning to realise that all policy and public spending must be put through a net zero filter,” said Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the thinktank Green Alliance. “The whole government now needs to shift gear and ensure that ‘build back better’ and ‘green recovery’ are not just slogans, but drive the economic recovery from Covid-19.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb99b26bf18f30041654a6bc4e3c66d7757ef52d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=959633dc753902cca1aafa2a7f815521","title":"the science of shorts how to pull off this summers toughest style","story":"It’s boom time for short trousers – just make sure you swerve the ‘Boris Johnson out for a jog’ look This week’s dress code can be summarised in one word: shorts. There is a heatwave incoming, for a start. Plus, this weekend would have been Glastonbury, so the spirit of imaginary Worthy Farm is in the air, conjuring up the ghosts of Kate Moss and Alexa Chung in hot pants and wellies.Look around you. It is boom time for shorts: perfect with trainers when you are walking or cycling rather than taking public transport ideal for impromptu frisbee games. Also, the are-they-office-appropriate problem is, well, not an problem. (Marks \u0026amp Spencer reported that nine out of the bestselling menswear items in the first days after it reopened were shorts.)The past three months have relaxed our standards of wardrobe formality. Not getting dressed up for work events, weddings or parties has dialled down our wardrobes to the point where what used to look scruffy now looks acceptable – and what once looked like a baseline level of public-facing polish reads as if you have made a tremendous effort. Something has shifted, also, for those who have tended not to be “brave” enough to wear shorts. The past three months has pushed us outside our comfort zone in so many ways. Getting hung up about whether other people are looking at your knees? Maybe we can leave that one in the old normal.The shorts vibe of 2020 is one part Paul Mescal owning lockdown London in his O’Neills Gaelic football shorts and one part Carrie Bradshaw tapping at her laptop on a hot Manhattan night in a stretchy tank top and a pair of boyish athletic shorts. (Carrie Bradshaw at her laptop is a bluechip working-from-home icon, of course.) The loose, boxer-style shorts Rachel Green wore to hang out at home with Monica in Friends two decades ago are now turning up on Instagram: see Teen Vogue’s fashion editor, Michelle Li, who has been chronicling her at-home athleisure during quarantine in New York.Leggings were ideal when we wore our athleisure in the sleek, minimal aesthetic of a yoga studio, but when your exercise class is an Instagram Live in the kitchen or tricep dips on a park bench, the lo-fi, games-kit mood of what are essentially PE shorts hits the spot. Cut-off denim Daisy Dukes are a touch too poseurish for this moment. Culottes, which are basically shorts pretending to be midi skirts, are a little unnecessarily fiddly and formal. Cycling shorts are still going strong, buoyed by Lizzo and their usefulness when riding a bike, and long, tailored Bermuda shorts would probably have been more of a hit had this summer involved more urban commuting. There is a niche revival for the buttock-hugging micro boxer short in its 70s-retro mode – think Barbra Streisand in the 1979 film The Main Event – but the loose, athletic style short is where it’s at.\u2028Do not be fooled by the air of pull-on ease, however, because this is not a straightforward look to pull off. Too saggy and scruffy and you inch perilously close to “Boris Johnson out for a jog”. You need a wide waistband and enough fabric to give a standalone, slightly A-line silhouette – not a million miles from the paper-bag waist silhouette, in fashion terms. You need to accessorise, to make the point that this is fashion. (A bumbag will do the trick nicely.)

Hollywood has finally come calling.A New Zealand talent agency is looking for actors to appear in the big-budget Lord of the Rings television adaptation, due to resume filming in the country shortly, and is seeking urgent applications from people they have euphemistically deemed “funky looking” in an unusual job advertisement.The Facebook post by a casting agency in New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland, lists facial burns, “long skinny” limbs, acne scars, deep cheekbones, facial lines, missing bones, large eyes, and skinny faces as desirable qualities.It does not mention a particular role, and an earlier image has been removed that featured a range of police mugshots to illustrate the look the agency is seeking.The booker who wrote the post said she was not allowed to confirm to the  that she was selecting applicants for the Lord of the Rings television series, which is due for release next year on Amazon Prime. But an earlier version of the Facebook post described her as “lead booker submitting talent for Amazon’s Lord of the Rings” and included the hashtag #lordoftheringsonprime. The mention of Lord of the Rings was later edited out of the post.Pre-production on the television series – for which a second season has already been commissioned – was disrupted in March due to the Covid-19 crisis, the New Zealand Herald reported. It is set to resume next month in Auckland, according to the newspaper.The agency, BGT, has been providing extras for the Lord of the Rings franchise since Peter Jackson’s movies were filmed in New Zealand in the early 2000s.It is not the first time that adapting Tolkien’s fantasy novels for the screen has required a search for unusual-looking actors. An advertisement in October for the television series called for applicants who were particularly tall (over 1.95m), short (below 1.5m), androgynous or hairy.And while work as an film extra can be boring and poorly paid, there are always Tolkien super-fans eager to do it. In 2012, a casting call for the The Hobbit films outside Wellington was shut down and police were called after 3,000 unusual-looking hopefuls thronged to audition.Only those who have the right to work in New Zealand and live in Auckland should apply for the latest roles, the agency said.In response to the post , a number of people jokingly tagged their friends in the comments – most of whom did not fit the bill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21382daea48faee90773357bb6e8369358978745/53_156_2919_1751/master/2919.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb618ac91c87140601b079c4fc43695b","title":"my favourite film aged 12 bridget jones diary renee zellweger","story":"Garrulous and inappropriate, Renée Zellweger’s heroine drove home the farce of impossible, gendered standards. I couldn’t have had a better guide for my teen yearsBridget Jones loomed large over my early adolescence, by which I mean that a seven-foot-tall poster of Renée Zellweger in character hung behind my best friend’s bed. Bridget watched over us as we slept back-to-back at sleepovers, analysed whether it was worth spending 10p of precious phone credit replying to an SMS from a boy off the bus and built a brains trust of everything we knew about sex. Plenty has been written about how Helen Fielding’s creation is antifeminist and perpetuates outdated ideas about body image and marriage as the ultimate goal for a woman. But in many ways Bridget was a sound guide through those formative years.Aged 12 I had already read the book, assuming it – probably not incorrectly – to be a kind of adult version of Adrian Mole. (I felt let down by The Cappuccino Years: Mole cooking offal in some restaurant was much less interesting than measuring his willy with a ruler.) It was rude and funny – I loved it. When the film was announced, I knew some people were annoyed that an American actor had been cast as Bridget but I had no idea who Zellweger was either way so I didn’t care. Plus my beloved Geri Halliwell was on the soundtrack: what could anyone have to complain about? The trailer quickly became a communal classroom obsession, the line “wanton sex goddess with a very bad man between her thighs – mum, hi!” quickly deposing childish Simpsons catchphrases, because pre-teen girls are ardent perverts.I grew up in Cornwall and had been to London once, for a day. Bridget Jones’s Diary opened up an adult, metropolitan world full of “urban families”, mini breaks to Paris and posh women with names like Perpetua. But Bridget, when she’s not with her cutting, cackling best friends, is always on the outside. She works in publishing but hasn’t mastered the literary bullshitting that fuels the industry. (“Sal-maan!” “Chech-nyaaah”, “the problem with Martin’s definition of the novella …”) She’s just as alienated at her parents’ house, where their chintz is resolutely un-chucked. Bridget’s mother tells her what to wear and parades her around family events like a sullen child while she endures having her bottom pinched. (A disturbingly familiar experience back then.) She was just like a teenage girl.Seduced by her boss, Daniel Cleaver (a no-flies-on-me Hugh Grant), Bridget attempts to transform herself from chaotic lush to ideal woman. “First, look gorgeous,” Zellweger says in voiceover over a montage of her waxing, wincing, primping and comparing the potential success rates of control pants and a thong. I didn’t see a template, but a warning. If a tense, noir surf riff out of a spy film didn’t emphasise the absurd stealth manoeuvres that underpin female beauty standards, the Spanx wedgie drove home the indignity.And god, the indignities. Workplace harassment, impromptu public speaking. Even if, aged 12, you had not yet been tricked into dressing as a Playboy bunny for a garden party and subject to the patronising biological clock “tick-tock” of smug marrieds called – sorry, what – Cosmo and Woney (what the hell was going on in London), these horrors resonated in skirts tucked in knickers, in being frogmarched by a teacher to the loos to wipe off what was evidently not a discrete application of mascara. In his original review from 2001, the ’s Peter Bradshaw says the film makes Bridget “look like the world’s biggest prat, and an egregious emotional imbecile”. To me, she wasn’t an imbecile, but emblematic of these impossible standards, ones that Zellweger bore with painfully apologetic brightness. The endless brilliant comedic set pieces drove home the farce of gendered expectations and made us vigilant against them.But the film as a cultural entity amplified those impossible standards in a nastier sense. As well as the outrage around a Texan playing our English heroine, I remember endless coverage of Zellweger’s weight gain for the part. This was the ultimate indignity, the press affirmed though not to worry, an army of professional trainers would help her lose it afterwards. Size 10 at a push, Bridget was described as some kind of repulsive beast, while the film provided handy shots of diary pages detailing her weight so that viewers could make comparisons. It may have been the first time I heard of cellulite. Bradshaw, again: “Her thighs are massively dimpled and her great bottom is stately as a sinking galleon, and it’s always in our face.” When Bridget finds Cleaver’s American girlfriend hiding in his bathroom, the latter remarks: “I thought you said she was thin”, which struck me even then as uncharacteristically cruel for the film. This media obsession found its inverse in sensationalism masked as concern for Halliwell’s newly minuscule figure, a saga that played out as the never-media-shy ex-Spice Girl rode the film’s promotional wave. The effect was unforgettable.At least Colin Firth’s Mark Darcy, a burning ember of a heartthrob, likes Bridget very much, just the way she is: garrulous, boozy, inappropriate. These are good words to hear when you’re 12, even if later you learn to look beyond male validation. The codes of the grownup world – stiff dinner parties and wanky soirees – turn out to be nonsense much less fun than getting pissed with the people who know you down to the cobbles outside your flat, who will pretend to enjoy a meal of homemade blue soup, omelette and marmalade at your birthday dinner. That’s the shared language that is important. (“Gravy needs sieving, Pam.” “Surely not, Una, just stir it.”) Their callbacks became ours. “Where the fuck is the fucking tuna?” “Come the fuck on, Bridge.” I’ve watched the film so many times that I can hear the actors reciting the lines as if recalling the chorus of a pop song, though I also hear them in the voice of one of my other best friends.Almost 20 years later, Bridget Jones’s Diary gives me a huge sense of my own mortality. (And not just because the last time I saw it, prior to this rewatch, was coupled with frozen pizza and salad cream on a decrepit Sunday afternoon in November after a 24-hour clubbing excursion.) Everyone’s so young, yet we’re now their age, with stories of bad boyfriends, horrible bosses and social awkwardness to burn. Imagine owning a flat in Borough Market. It’s a Miramax film – I wonder what of the more bitingly feminist parts of Fielding’s book Harvey Weinstein might have squeezed out. I wonder how many more big-budget comedy films about women there will be after the coronavirus squeeze on cinema. There are comforts among the uncertainties. Those women are still my closest friends. Bridget Jones’s Diary is still funny. The poster is long gone, but the bullshit radar Bridget gave us has been finely honed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/254d4c5dcd14a0c50b72ac7c2157541511228b8e/0_33_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c120eb805c26f2a04958625f1ee0e378","title":"burnley to show support for black lives matter after banner stunt","story":"Burnley will demonstrate further opposition to the “White Lives Matter Burnley” banner flown over the Etihad Stadium when they resume their campaign at home against Watford on Thursday.Players and club officials were appalled by the stunt over Manchester City’s stadium before kick-off on Monday when the captain, Ben Mee, said he felt ashamed and embarrassed. Discussions were held on Tuesday at the club over reiterating condemnation of the banner, and support for the Black Lives Matter movement, at the Watford game. Although details have yet to be confirmed it is understood Burnley will project their “One Club For All” message inside the stadium with support from Sean Dyche’s squad.Burnley issued a statement during the match on Monday that condemned the banner and vowed to ban for life those supporters responsible. That stance was repeated in a statement by the chairman, Mike Garlick, and chief executive, Neil Hart, on Tuesday. Lancashire police have said no criminal offence took place.Garlick said in an interview with ESPN: “We need to gather our thoughts, but clearly we need to make a clear stand against this sort of behaviour. I am sure will be doing that over the next few days to make our actions speak as loudly as our words. It’s a tiny minority, as any form of hooliganism or racism always has been, because the vast majority come to football in peace. But I want to stress that Burnley football club welcomes all people, from all creeds, races and religions.”Garlick echoed Mee’s embarrassment at Monday’s events – the chairman was at the Etihad Stadium – and said it was a shameful episode. “We will root out these racists and I am sure they will be dealt with in due course,” he said.“We will do whatever we can to make sure justice is done against these people. Let’s be clear. The plane didn’t fly in our name. It has absolutely nothing to do with Burnley football club and we absolutely deplore it. But we have to talk about it. We cannot and will not sweep it under the carpet.“I was at the game and I have been chairmanco-chairman for eight years. I have always been proud to be in that position, but I can tell you that I wasn’t proud to be Burnley chairman last night. It was for all the events that happened off the pitch, not what happened on the pitch. The game became irrelevant after the plane flew over. But I thought Ben Mee, our captain, spoke exceptionally well in really difficult circumstances. I am proud that he is captain of our football club and I have told him that.”Burnley’s condemnation of the banner on Monday prompted numerous complaints on social media and to the club questioning their stance. Garlick and Hart felt compelled to explain their objection in Tuesday’s statement. It read: “While we naturally consider that all lives matter, let us be clear that the Black Lives Matter movement aims to overcome years of racial inequality against the BAME community and promote a greater fairness for all. We at Burnley therefore stand firmly behind it and oppose anything that may appear to undermine or challenge such a positive message.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/286655d605b3fd0583ee5886fd484e6967f956de/0_91_2439_1463/master/2439.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e5f77a2186827964b514cb5f5ad0bbc","title":"from 5 1 down to winning 7 6 in 20 minutes is there a better comeback","story":"Plus: professional games at training grounds, more dreadful debuts and managers smoking at pitchside“In the 1950s, my father was a photographer on the Sunday Express. He took me to one game in 1956, Charlton v Huddersfield. With 20 minutes to go, Charlton were 5-1 down. The game ended with Charlton winning 7-6. Has there ever been another occasion when a team was losing so heavily, but ended up winning in such a short space of time?” asked Mitch Mitchell.“The ‘Wunder von der Grotenburg’ on 19 March 1986 is possibly the closest in recent memory,” notes Darren Beach. “With just over half an hour left in the second leg of their Cup Winners’ Cup quarter-final, East German powerhouse Dynamo Dresden led 3-1 at the home of unheralded West Germans Bayer Uerdingen, and more importantly led 5-1 on aggregate.“A penalty for the home side after 58 minutes pulled one back, before another quick strike put Uerdingen ahead on the night after 65 minutes. Dresden, who had the away goals advantage too, managed to stem the flow for a while before goals in the 78th and 79th minutes put the home side 6-3 in front and gave them an aggregate lead for the first time in the tie. A seventh goal four minutes from time – their sixth in 28 minutes – sealed an incredible 7-3 win for Uerdingen and passage to the semi-finals (where they lost to Atlético Madrid).“An interesting coda to the tale is that Dresden striker Frank Lipmann, who scored in both legs of the tie, went awol from the team hotel and defected to the West immediately after the match. After a year’s Fifa suspension he restarted his career in the Bundesliga with FC Nürnberg.”Paul Carver directs us to the K-League: “Last season, Pohang Steelers were leading Gangwon FC 4-0 away after 70 minutes. However, Gangwon scored in the 71st, 79th, 92nd, 94th and 96th minutes to snatch the win with the last kick of the game.”Finally, Stig Wallerman brings us full circle. “Sweden’s AIK played a friendly against an English club on 7 June 1946. AIK were 7-1 down with half an hour to go, but managed to score six to make it even. The English team was – you’ve guessed it – Charlton Athletic.”“Real Madrid’s La Liga match against Eibar took place at their training complex because of work being done on the Bernabéu. Have any other competitive matches between professional clubs been played at training grounds?” asked Gregg Bakowski.We’re off to Scandinavia for a positive answer to this one. “The Swedish Cup has a group stage in February and March which acts as a useful prelude to the start of the league season,” writes David Ekstrand. “Due to the climate, clubs are required to play their Cup games on artificial turf. In some cases, clubs have had to use their training grounds: two top-flight examples are IK Sirius and Kalmar FF.”Fraser Thom has an example from the United States. “Seattle Sounders have played a lot of their early round US Open Cup games at their training ground. Most of these have come against lower-league opposition but there have been a few all-MLS clashes held there, including against rivals Portland, a game which could easily sell out Seattle’s regular stadium several times over.”Following on from last week’s Knowledge, here a couple more choice examples. “Poor old Michael Theoklitos made his debut in goal for Norwich against Colchester on 8 August 2009, in our first game since being relegated to League One,” writes Will Tucker. “He let in seven goals in a 7-1 defeat, manager Bryan Gunn was sacked and Paul Lambert, who masterminded Colchester’s victory, took over as manager. Theoklitos never played for the club again.”“I thought it was worth mentioning Nigel Pepper when discussing disastrous debuts,” begins Kirk Burton. “After coming on as a sub on his debut for Aberdeen, Pepper was sent off after six minutes. In Pepper’s first game after suspension he was sent off again after 17 seconds. Aberdeen band Depeche Choad have a song named in tribute to his second brief appearance, the song is just as brief.”Indeed they do, James. “I can gleefully point out my beloved Swindon Town’s Arthur Daley-esque gaffer, Andy King,” points out Nick Hide. “As any viewer of Sky’s coverage of our play-off loss to Brighton will tell you, King spent the entire match - and especially the penalty shoot-out - puffing away on those horrible little cigars you get in newsagents. The rogue.”And he’s not the only one. “Both Gianluca Vialli at Chelsea and Stan Ternent at Burnley enjoyed sparking up when the game was getting a little too frenetic,” says Tim Postins. “I always thought that smoking in the dugout in the UK was banned by the various FAs - hence all the gum-chewing and lollipop-sucking.”And cheeky tokes aren’t just confined to off the field. “Roy Vernon, Everton’s Welsh international of the 1950s, used to smoke during the kick-in before the game,” says Pat Kevin.“Kirsty MacColl wrote a song specifically about England’s 2-0 win over Colombia at France 98 (or at least going on a bad date to watch it). I was wondering if there are other songs that specifically mention inidual matches. The only other one I can think of is The First Big Weekend of the Summer by Arab Strap, which details Aidan Moffat being hungover and sleeping through England 2-0 Scotland at Euro 96” – Mike Meehall-Wood.“Which player has gone back and forth between the Premier League and the Championship most often?” asks Kieran Murray.Send your questions and answers to knowledge@the or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c0c2239ec31ab5d2a803872a3fc71183e4bd600/0_380_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f62d7373173c739db43fe9fbee2955d5","title":"brands fans and influencers why social media for small business is about more than sales","story":"Standing out online can transform a business, but it takes focus and strategy. Here, three stars of social share what they’ve learnedMost businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base – half the world’s population is now on social media – it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of “job done”, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.\u0026nbspBeyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what’s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.\u0026nbspBut as well as all this modern stuff – the basics are still important too.\u0026nbsp“On the high street you wouldn’t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,” says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.\u0026nbsp“Social media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,” he says. “High-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.”The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don’t engage and share your original posts then you’re missing a huge potential source of customers.\u0026nbspWhen Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers with GoDaddy.Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.\u0026nbsp“I just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,” says Plas.\u0026nbspHer efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.\u0026nbspThe first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.\u0026nbsp“I understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.”Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.\u0026nbsp“Some influencers get a bad reputation,” says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.\u0026nbsp“Influencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don’t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,” she says.Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you’re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.\u0026nbsp“Anyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I’d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,” she says.\u0026nbsp“What’s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people’s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?”Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can’t be overstated.\u0026nbspThis is something Zaffrin and Brian O’Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.\u0026nbsp“Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,” says Zaffrin.\u0026nbspBefore setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.\u0026nbspThe stories the O’Sullivans shared weren’t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.Once the social channels were up and running, the O’Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy’s services – and they were in business.Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you’re willing to put money behind it – paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is “one to watch”.\u0026nbsp“Our audience are our fans,” she says. “They root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want. We are constantly listening to them, whether they’re letting us know how they are using our products or coming up with ideas for new ones.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed. Over 50 companies have joined the cause, including Slack, Salesforce, PayPal, and more"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893c4234ce16d684159cfc88b869209cae30b022/70_0_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e1de93741ab7d383dab75d5293360425","title":"end of hibernation what the papers say about englands lockdown easing","story":"Front pages seek to balance relief with the dangers that coronavirus still posesA combination of sunny weather and the approaching relaxation of coronavirus lockdown rules in England has led to jubilation on some front pages today, as others mark the start of the end of “our long national hibernation”.“Summer’s back on!” says the Daily Mail, and quotes Boris Johnson urging people to get out and enjoy themselves. It notes, however, the move is a “calculated gamble to head off economic disaster”.The Express takes a similar tack. It uses a picture of the prime minister with beer held aloft alongside the headline: “Cheers Boris! Here’s to a brighter Britain”. It tempers the joy with a message across the top: “PM: we’re coming out of hibernation but virus still a risk”.  also uses the pub theme with “Get the beers in”.The Sun says: “Vast orders” along with a picture showing lots of beer. It reports people are getting ready for “super Saturday” when pubs will openThe prime minister’s “hibernation” comment was the pick of the rest of the papers. balances the relief with the still-serious dangers the virus poses. “PM hails ‘end of hibernation’ – but scientists urge caution” is the headline, beside a grim-faced Johnson delivering the news of the “one-metre plus” rules coming in on 4 July.The  quotes Johnson for its headline: “Our hibernation is beginning to end, the bustle is coming back”. Underneath, a comment piece by associate editor Camilla Tominey is headlined: “So we gingerly get back to normal – in a world that is anything but”.The Times has a straightforward: “Hibernation at an end” and a handy box of the incoming guidelines at a glance. It also joins other papers in looking at the life and death of film financier Steve Bing.The Mirror appears more discombobulated than celebratory in its treatment of the guidelines. “Life … but not as we know it”, is the headline above “Britain unlocked”.The FT gives the bottom half of its front to the coronavirus news. “Johnson gives green light to reopen pubs despite “great worries” of chief adviser,” is their headline but the main story is about the arrest of former Wirecard CEO Markus Braun on suspicion of falsifying accounts.Virus-wise in Scotland, the National reports on anger at BBC Scotland for cutting off the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, in order to receive an update on the virus in England.The Herald reports on the two-metre rule staying in place in Scotland. Sturgeon has said she will be able to give “more clarity” later this week on a timeline for the next steps out of lockdown.The Scotsman says the country will follow the example of nations such as Australia and scrap social distancing measures between pupils in schools."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b202ba8de986a737d3646af9539146f943859ab/700_330_3662_2198/master/3662.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c6cd84eb3a2cc6839f41d9f6ab787f60","title":"you cant pay cash here how cashless society harms most vulnerable","story":"Retailers and banks have been pushing us to use contactless payments and online services for hygiene reasons. But many older, abused and unbanked people still depend on cash. What will happen to them?It had taken so much for Tina to get to the supermarket to go home empty-handed left her in tears. Tina, 47, has conditions including chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. She should not have been out at all, but, although her doctor had told her to shield indoors, she had not been put on the government’s high-risk list, meaning she has to do her food shopping herself.Tina had taken the bus from her home in Kent to her local supermarket. She had queued up outside, which is tough when you are on crutches – standing up for any period of time is fatiguing. When she got into the supermarket, she hustled around as quickly as she could and was relieved to find they had almost everything she needed. At the till, the checkout assistant scanned Tina’s items. She got out her cash. The checkout operator waved it away. “You can’t pay cash in here,” she told Tina. “It’s against the law.”Tina knew that could not be true. “I said: ‘It’s not the law,’” Tina remembers. “‘You can only refuse a note if it’s a forgery. It’s the Queen’s legal tender!’” But the checkout operator insisted – it was a card payment or nothing. Tina told her that she could not pay by card because she did not have enough money in her account to cover the shopping. The checkout operator would not budge. “I got the bus home in tears.”Tina is one of the many people who have struggled to purchase necessities during the coronavirus pandemic, as retailers increasingly refuse to take cash. A recent study of more than 2,000 people by the consumer group Which? found that one in 10 people were refused by shops when trying to purchase essential items with cash during the pandemic. Which? has long been calling on the government to protect cash as a payment option, with some success: the chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak, pledged to protect access to cash in his 11 March budget.If you have ever seen a queue outside banks or post offices to pay bills in cash, you may have seen people like Tina. As is the case for many people on benefits, low incomes or without access to online banking, Tina usually withdraws her personal independence payment and her employment and support allowance in cash. She then tops up her gas and electric at the bank, where she also pays her council tax, and puts the rest aside for food.Those of us who use contactless payment technology routinely scarcely noticed the coronavirus-induced switch to a virtually cashless economy, apart from the limit being increased to £45. But for the approximately 1.2 million people living in the UK who are unbanked – meaning they don’t have access to any bank account – buying essentials became a herculean undertaking. “People without legal immigration status in the UK are not legally allowed to open a bank account,” says James Tullett of the migrant and refugee charity Ramfel. When shops refuse to take cash from these people, they leave them vulnerable to bad actors, Tullett adds. “They are likely to use informal services, which are more open to being exploited.”It is not only unbanked people who will have struggled during the pandemic. People with bank accounts prefer to use cash for a variety of practical and personal reasons. “Those who rely on cash are the most vulnerable people in our society,” says Ceeney. “They may live in a rural area where they can’t get the decent broadband or mobile signal they need for online banking. Or they may be older or on low incomes.”Domestic abuse survivors often squirrel away emergency cash – the odd fiver here and there is easy to hide. “Access to cash is really important,” says Nicola Sharp of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse, “both in terms of their ability to flee and their safety after fleeing.” She explains that many abusers monitor bank transactions, leaving survivors reliant on cash. “Measures to go cashless create a context in which it is more difficult for survivors to access the cash they need,” Sharp says. Age UK received a surge of phone calls in the third week of lockdown, as older people with diminishing reserves worried about how they would reimburse neighbours and relatives for their food shopping. In response, Barclays, NatWest and Tesco Bank started sending out cash through the post. But some older people were left with no choice but to hand over their bank cards to strangers and trust them to do the right thing.“I will not do banking on the iPad at all,” says Audrey, an 87-year-old retiree from Bedfordshire. “I just refuse to do it.” Normally, this poses no problem: it is a 15-minute walk from Audrey’s house to her local building society. But during coronavirus, Audrey – who has lived alone since her husband died eight years ago – has relied on her son to withdraw cash for her, which she gives to her neighbours for food shopping. “I put the cash in an envelope and leave it on the doorstep,” says Audrey. But she worries about older people without family to help out. “What if you don’t have a family?” she asks. “How do you get cash then?”Consumers and retailers favour contactless payments for hygiene reasons: there is no need for customers to handle chip-and-pin machines. “Covid has been a massive win for the digital payments industry, and the digital world more generally, as people retreat from the physical,” says Brett Scott, author of The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance.But, as the economy switched to contactless in a matter of days, many people were left behind. Jaki Whyte, 38, from Colchester, has only a chip-and-pin debit card. This proved difficult during the pandemic, as Whyte – who is disabled and on the shielding list – relies on care workers to pick up supplies. On three occasions, White’s care workers were refused at her local pharmacy because her card was not contactless. (She is not registered for online banking because she can’t afford the data on her phone and, until the banks reopen, she is not able to request a contactless payment card.) “It took nearly two and a half months to get what I needed,” Whyte says, “and only because a family member got a lift into town to help me out.”When Whyte ventures back into the world, she will probably find it more difficult than ever to purchase necessities. “When we emerge from covid,” says Ceeney, “our cash infrastructure will be even more unviable, and it’s likely we’ll see more bank closures. Shops need to deposit cash. If they don’t have a local bank branch where they can do that, it makes taking cash really difficult. That’s why more retailers are going to go cashless.”Some would argue that a cashless society is the future who are we to resist it? Surely people such as Audrey should receive digital literacy training and those who refuse should be corralled through the removal of ATMs, bank closures and card-only tills until the narrowing and more desperate cadre of digital refuseniks is finally obliterated. But there are ideological reasons to resist going cashless. “The war on cash is a bigger issue than people realise,” says Scott.The private banking sector, and payment companies such as Visa and Mastercard, want us to stop using cash. “These guys have been battling against cash,” Scott says. “They view cash as a cost.” (By contrast, state-run banks generally try to preserve access to cash.) When we move towards a cashless society, Scott explains, we are locked into the private banking system. “Imagine you go to a casino and you have cash with you – state money,” Scott says. “The casino gives you chips, which you can cash out when you leave. A similar thing goes on in the private banking sector. Every time they close branches or cut ATMs, they’re preventing you from exiting their system. Our ability to exit the banking sector is the single greatest thing that holds banks in check,” Scott says.The slide towards a cashless economy also raises privacy concerns. “With digital systems, there are huge amounts of data,” Scott says. “When you can see what people are buying, you can start to block payments, chaperone payments, mess with payments … financial data is one of the most sensitive forms of data around.” Moving to a digital-first system benefits the major players, something Audrey understands intuitively. “It’s all right for the big boys, for the banks,” Audrey says. “It makes their lives easy for them: no cash! But I don’t think for the small traders it will do them any good.” Retailers usually pay fees on contactless payments. She worries about how service industry workers will fare. “Suppose you go on a coach outing,” Audrey says. “Normally you put 50p into a whip-round for the guide. How would you do a whip-round if you haven’t got any cash?”This Covid-19-accelerated move to a cashless economy will hurt the most vulnerable in our society the most. “Cash dependence mirrors classic vulnerabilities in terms of income, disability and race,” says Ceeney. People who earn less than £10,000 are 14 times more likely to be dependent on cash than those who earn more than £30,000 a year. “The reason for this is primarily budgeting,” Ceeney explains. “If you’re a gig economy worker, direct debits can be dangerous. If you have a fixed amount of money in cash, you can budget for exactly what you have.” Contactless payments, which can often take a few days to come out of accounts, can skew a precarious financial balance.This is the reason Whyte prefers to use cash. “I can see in my hands how much, physically, I’ve got,” she explains. “I can’t budget when it’s not cash – I don’t know where I’ve spent my money. I can’t do mental maths like that.” Cash is either there or it is not – Tina also does not have to worry about a direct debit looming out of the digital ether and destabilising her finances. “I know what it’s like to go without food, gas or electric,” she says. “With cash, I know exactly how much is in my purse.”For Tina, having to switch to digital payments during the pandemic has been stressful. She recently got out of debt with the help of the charity Christians Against Poverty. Having to set up card payments during the pandemic – she could not pay for her gas or electricity at the bank – caused her mental health to deteriorate. Her daughter helped, but still Tina worries. “What if I’ve done something wrong and the bill hasn’t been paid?” Tina says. “It’s made my anxiety worse.”What are the long-term implications of starving a nation of its access to cash? More anxiety for Tina. Increased exploitation of unbanked people. Fewer options for women fleeing abusive relationships. People who beg and charities that rely on cash donations disadvantaged. A public locked into a private banking system from which we have no escape and increasingly less autonomy. “If we go to a cashless society, I won’t be able to cope,” Tina says.“Cash is really the bicycle of payments,” says Scott. “It preceded the car and is still popular today. We need to have a multimodal form of payment systems … cash and card working together, just as bicycles and car lanes go together.” Because, although cash may be a pain to carry around sometimes, it is actually pretty useful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3095f6032b55f9daaf9696f8475070ece49cf2e/0_279_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d9553ac39e2b3cab196b439f7eab50cb 1290w","title":"uk border force detained pregnant woman for 24 hours inspectors find","story":"Report says children are routinely handcuffed and those detained often held in ‘very poor conditions’ A pregnant woman was detained at the UK border for more than 24 hours with “little meaningful contact”, a damning report into the agency responsible for controlling entry to the country has revealed.Children are being routinely handcuffed by Border Force when they arrive in the UK before they are detained in its short-term holding facilities, which are often in “very poor” condition, inspectors said.Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) visited sites at eight seaports and five airports in March – the first time the inspectors had assessed them on a national basis.Inspectors hit out at Border Force, which is part of the Home Office, for an “alarming” lack of oversight as the organisation was unable to tell them how many short-term detention cells it ran or how long detainees were held for.Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, said: “The fact that Border Force senior managers could not even tell us with certainty which of their ports actually had detention facilities suggests an alarming lack of oversight and accountability.”He added: “There is an urgent need for Border Force managers to undertake a comprehensive national audit of detention, to assure themselves and the public that all sites of detention are identified, properly equipped for holding detainees and subject to consistent management.”Migrants detained at airports generally arrived after short flights, usually from Europe, while those stopped at ferry docks arrived on foot or by car, most after “arduous and often dangerous journeys concealed in lorries and containers”, Clarke said.He said staff tried to provide “respectful detention” but added: “These detainees were subsequently held in often very poor conditions.“Local Border Force staff were themselves commonly embarrassed by the low standard of accommodation and lack of facilities.”According to the report, inspectors became aware last year they had not been notified of some short-term holding facilities being used by Border Force.The organisation subsequently provided a list of 11, nine of which were previously unknown to inspectors.Holly Lynch, the shadow immigration minister, said: “The Border Force has come under real pressure in this pandemic – and this is set to increase as quarantine rules are loosened. Once again we are calling on the government to ensure both compassion and competence underpin the work of Border Force.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “We take the criticisms contained in this report seriously and work to make improvements is already under way.“An audit of all Border Force-run short-term holding facilities, which will establish national accommodation standards, was launched last month and new processes for record keeping, to ensure length of detention is kept to a minimum, have been developed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6ff6ac560668e4f17a928819276f958ea2810ac/0_0_5280_3168/master/5280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce0017cd4068bb99946de8abf8815814","title":"treasury announces 85m for rough sleeper accommodation","story":"People housed in hotels in England during the pandemic won’t have to return to streetsAn extra £85m has been announced by the Treasury to provide emergency accommodation for 5,400 rough sleepers who have been placed in hotels in England for the duration of the pandemic, avoiding them having to return to the streets when the hotels reopen to the public this summer.The extra money will allow councils to rehouse rough sleepers in student accommodation and to find alternative spaces elsewhere until more permanent housing is found.Dame Louise Casey, the chair of the Covid-19 rough sleeping taskforce, said she was extremely relieved the extra money had been allocated, allowing charities and councils longer to work to find long-term housing for those rough sleepers who have been staying in Ibis, Holiday Inn and Travelodge hotels at the government’s expense since the end of March.“This will make sure that local authorities and others don’t have to put people back out on the street. I think it would be, frankly, inhuman – because we’ve given people a taste of life off the street and a taste of life where you get your health looked after. The last think we want is for anyone to go back,” she said. The funding meant she could “guarantee” that nobody would have to leave to return to a life on the streets.Securing the funding had “taken a little bit longer than I would have liked”, Casey said. “But now we can assure people that nobody goes back.”While it was unrealistic to expect the country’s rough sleeping crisis to have been entirely solved during the pandemic period, she said progress was being made, although inevitably some people might make a choice to return to rough sleeping.Casey also stressed the significance of having avoided known Covid-19 deaths among England’s homeless population.Casey said it had been a privilege to work on the unprecedented drive to get rough sleepers into hotels within the space of about three days as lockdown was announced in March. “It’s been absolutely great to give people the knowledge that there is another life off the street,” she said. She said it had inspiring to see the transformation of many people who had come into hotels “emaciated” and unwell.The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said: “In recent months, I have seen a huge effort across the country to keep almost 15,000 vulnerable people off the streets. This has been vital to ensure their safety during the peak of the pandemic and has changed the lives of thousands for the better.“The additional funding announced today will allow us to continue to support these iniduals – giving them access to the accommodation and support they need now while we continue with plans to deliver thousands of long-term homes in the coming months.”Jon Sparkes, the chief executive of Crisis, called the extra funding “a real step forward”, but added: “Money alone will not provide a guarantee of safe and secure accommodation during and after this public health crisis. We need emergency legal measures to ensure that every local council can provide housing support to everyone experiencing homelessness, regardless of their immigration status.“Across the country, we know that support is patchy and inconsistent, with councils often uncertain who they should be helping, and in need of clarity and direction from government.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8195394b2cdd5e2f02de2b6f0eed3b62794e54d4/0_83_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0951d9c3fb17926fb00499e8e73763b0","title":"fbi investigation bubba wallace noose nascar","story":"The FBI says that the noose found in the team garage of Bubba Wallace, Nascar’s only black full-time driver, was not part of a hate crime.“The FBI report concludes, and photographic evidence confirms, that the garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose had been positioned there since as early as last fall,” Nascar said in a statement. “This was obviously well before the 43 team’s arrival and garage assignment.“We appreciate the FBI’s quick and thorough investigation and are thankful to learn that this was not an intentional, racist act against Bubba. We remain steadfast in our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all who love racing.”The FBI said there will be no charges over the incident.A crew member found the noose at the Talladega Superspeedway on Sunday and it was reported to Nascar. An investigation involving the justice department and FBI was launched on Monday, two weeks after Wallace had started a successful campaign to remove the Confederate flag from Nascar events. The removal was not welcomed by some fans who paraded the flag outside the Talladega track at the weekend.Before Monday’s race at Talladega, Wallace was given a stirring show of support by his fellow drivers and the pit crews, who pushed his car to the front of the grid. Wallace broke down in tears after the gesture.“This sport is changing,” Wallace said after the race. “The prerace deal was probably one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to witness in my life. From all the supporters, from drivers to crew members, everybody here, the badass fan base, thank you guys for coming out. This is truly incredible, and I’m glad to be a part of this sport.”Nascar has only had four black drivers in its 72-year history, and has long been known for elements of racism in its fanbase.

After two weeks of bros prancing around big crowds in the middle of a pandemic, everyone was suddenly wearing a mask for the first time. The photos also underlined how young the players involved were. Borna Coric, who also contracted the virus, Alexander Zverev, Donna Vekic and Andrey Rublev are grown up enough to be responsible for their own decisions, but there needed to be better guidance from the elders around them. Most importantly, there was one absence. Arguably the best tennis player of all time had invited them all to his event and exposed them to unsafe conditions, but as they nervously waited he was nowhere to be seen.It is now known that Novak Djokovic crossed borders with coronavirus in his system, as his long-awaited statement confirmed on Tuesday, marking an apt conclusion to a surreal saga. The schadenfreude has already started, but this is serious. This entire lockdown has been catastrophic for Djokovic’s reputation, dating back to those vaccine discussions and his Instagram live talks with numerous snake oil salesmen. People cackled at how loud and wrong Djokovic’s pseudoscientific assertions were, but the sight of Djokovic gullibly noting down each nonsensical belief spouted towards him was just disappointing and sad.There have been fiery discussions about how dangerous the word of a tennis player could even be, and now we have a clear conclusion. When people first stared at those crammed Belgrade crowds in horror, he reflexively pointed out that those criticisms stemmed from “the West”. They perhaps only emboldened the will to showcase Serbia’s mistaken “victory” over the virus. Opinions stemming from countries such as Britain and the US indeed can be sanctimonious and grating, but there is also such a thing as common sense. There are basic scientific realities that have been relayed for months, which have been badly ignored.Reality is something that male tennis players in general have not been part of for three months. Grigor Dimitrov is one of the most pleasant people in the sport but, as with the likes of Dominic Thiem and Zverev, he has spent the past few weeks traipsing around the globe in the middle of a pandemic, apparently without ever imagining he could catch and spread the virus himself. That, too, is dangerous.In his statement on Tuesday, Djokovic underlined the wish to hold the tournament for philanthropic reasons. There is a conversation to be had about nationalistic beliefs, but it is easy to believe he sincerely wanted to promote unity among some of his neighbours. As he showed the world the beautiful Zadar old town, the Croat media were taken by him: “Croatia is watching the best tennis player of all time, a charismatic athlete and friend of our country,” wrote 24sata.hr. A couple of weeks later, he was due to travel to Bosnia where the Serb would face his Bosnian friend Damir Dzumhur, who was born there during the war in the 1990s. They would have played in Sarajevo.Instead, along with the Serb and Croat federations that were so swept up in hosting the best player in the world, they too failed to take all precautions in the middle of a pandemic to keep their audience safe. Around a dozen prominent people have tested positive. Since all indications underlined that an event such as this involving Djokovic was coming, there isn’t much to learn from it.

Here was a race-meeting shorn of flummery, sideshow and distraction, so that the focus had nowhere else to go but on the action and the horses, and large audiences evidently found it compelling.The fact that so many people are confined to their homes and starved of live sport is a ready explanation for the increased figures but it is clearly good news that they were sustained through the week, despite the absence of things like the royal procession and the focus on well-dressed people having a jolly time which are commonly thought to be part of Royal Ascot’s appeal. As the trainer Mark Johnston put it pithily on Twitter: “And they thought people watched it for the hats.” “I wasn’t being too serious,” Johnston said on Tuesday. “The conclusion to be drawn is not necessarily that we can attract those figures every time. But there’s absolutely no doubt whatsoever, there is an audience there for pure horse racing. And the higher the quality, the bigger the audience, something that we’ve often had a struggle with the betting industry about, and even some sections of the media, obsessed with the idea that it’s about field size. If we sell the sport, the betting and everything else will follow.”Ascot’s spokesman, Nick Smith, also saw the viewing figures as “an endorsement of the appeal of the pure sport. Obviously, ITV did a tremendous job of presenting the event, with some excellent montages and royal pieces and their own take on the national anthem and singing around the bandstand. “In a normal year, there’s room for everything. What this and the Guineas has shown and what hopefully the rest of the summer will show is that there is an appetite for racing, that it is accessible and doesn’t need to be dumbed down. The Pattern has been even more complicated than usual this year and yet has been embraced and understood. It should encourage us to be more confident as a sport about what we have.“We should be proud of the sophisticated nature of our sport and less defensive about the allegation that it is not accessible. It is accessible but it requires a certain amount of thought and consideration and devotion. You can see from the viewing figures that there clearly are new people who were prepared to make that effort last week and hopefully have a clearer idea now of where things are going which, in this strange year, is towards the Derby and the Oaks.”“Telling the back story is really what gets people engaged. Less so the celebrities in marquees drinking champagne.” But Cumani insisted that, assuming a more normal summer next year, there would have to be a return of some features that would help broaden the event’s appeal. “I think there are things you can do that aren’t just racing, that do still appeal and are still true to the sport.”A Mark Johnston horse with obvious claims has been made favourite in the last at Hamilton but Dawaaween (3.50) looks a better option at 11-4. This lightly raced filly ran well enough to deserve a win on her first start for James Bethell a fortnight ago but, having battled her way to the front, was done close home by a well-backed rival on a tumbling rating that hadn’t scored for three years.Dawaaween has been nudged up by just a couple of pounds and still looks well treated. She’ll be a bit straighter this time and can hopefully get the job done.Tinochio (12.45) did easily best of those to come off the pace on his Pontefract debut, having been drawn wide. The market sees his chance but 6-4 is fair.At Haydock, High Flying Bird (3.40) has been allowed to drift to 12-1 but her reappearance was encouraging, when she was third here after racing on her own against the far rail for much of the straight. The winner has since been second in the Britannia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4899c5f4db7191fdfbc80c40b197ac92aa66a529/185_175_2510_1506/master/2510.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7815603a448bef0f903932580d8b041e","title":"apple ios 14 new features coming to ipad and iphone","story":"Firm announces latest innovations including for iPad and watch at US conferenceApple has announced the latest features heading to user iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches this summer.At the firm’s first virtual World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple showed off iOS 14, iPadOS 14 and watch OS 7, due to be released later this year as free updates.Last year’s iOS 13 introduced changes centred around privacy and speed, plus Dark Mode, but also came packed with bugs requiring a series of updates to fix various issues.This year Apple is concentrating customisation options to iOS 14. For the first time users will be able to view all their installed apps in a list view called App Library, similar to that available on most Android smartphones, which automatically sorts apps into large category folders or a searchable list. Users can also hide apps from the rest of the home screens by hiding pages.Apple is also adding widgets to the main home screen, which sit between app icons, including one that automatically selects time-dependent information called smartstack. Siri has been brought directly to the home screen as a pop-up overlay, rather than its own page that takes over the screen.Alongside offline, on-device voice transcription for dictation, Apple is also launching the Translate app, which is a direct competitor to Google’s Translate, capable of translating speech and text offline in 11 languages.Apple has also made tweaks to iMessage, with pinned messages, WhatsApp-like @-mentions and improvements to groups. Apple’s vastly improved Maps are also expanding to the UK, Ireland and Canada, with new cycling routes, new electric vehicle directions with charging information and saveable exploration guides.Apple is also looking to turn the iPhone into a car key with its new contactless CarKey feature that allows your iPhone to unlock a car using NFC. The feature is rolling out to both iOS 13 and the new iOS 14. The 2021 BMW 5 series will be the first car to support it.A new feature for the App Store called App Clips allows you to access some functions of an app that may be needed to access a service, without downloading the full app.Apple is also bringing more awareness of privacy to the App Store with privacy practices displayed from apps, covering what data they collect and which companies it is shared with, before you download them. It is also allowing users to share their approximate rather than exact location with apps and ensuring they ask before tracking you.Having gained full trackpad and mouse support in iPad OS 13.4, Apple’s iPad software is gaining the new features from iOS 14, including customised default apps, which will make the iPad even more like a laptop computer.New for iPad OS 14 is the introduction of sidebars to most first-party apps, and the addition of toolbars similar to desktops apps with drop-down menu actions. Universal Search has been revamped to more resemble the way Spotlight search works on a Mac, with a pop up that can be invoked over any app.The new Scribble feature allows you to to turn handwriting into text in any field, and select and move handwriting in notes, using the Apple Pencil stylus and on-device machine learning.Apple’s smartwatch continues to dominate the watch market. It’s watch OS software is gaining more customisation in the form of new rich complications and new watch faces, including the new Infograph face with a tachometer and the ability to share your customised face combinations to friends and family or download them from a site or app.The Workout app has also been redesigned and renamed Fitness, which better shows your current trends on the iPhone from the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch will also be able to finally track your sleep, matching offerings from Samsung, Garmin and others. Wind Down will attempt to help you sleep by reducing distractions on your iPhone and Watch, while new alarms including silent alarms can wake you in the morning.The Apple Watch will also automatically detect hand washing, using motion and sound, and then sets a countdown timer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cb1abb18c80352c6a8aa25b43b5761710c9087b/0_203_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58c49acc6c8930914525d9afc6849542","title":"segway transporter production ends","story":"Company will retire Segway PT, popular with tourists and police officers, on 15 JulySegway, which boldly claimed its two-wheeled personal transporter would revolutionize the way people get around, is ending production of its namesake vehicle.The Segway PT, popular with tourists and police officers but perhaps better known for its high-profile crashes, will be retired on 15 July, the company said in a statement.“Within its first decade, the Segway PT became a staple in security and law enforcement, viewed as an effective and efficient personal vehicle,” said Judy Cai, the Segway president, in a statement, noting that in the past decade it gained popularity with vacationers in major cities in North America, Europe, Asia, South America and the Middle East.The transportation revolution that inventor Dean Kamen envisioned when he founded the company in 1999 never took off. The Segway’s original price tag of around $5,000 was a hurdle for many customers. It also was challenging to ride because the rider had to be balanced at a specific angle for the vehicle to move forward. If the rider’s weight shifted too much in any direction, it could easily spin out of control and throw the rider off. They were banned in some cities because users could easily lose control if they were not balanced properly.“What did they think the market was when they built this, when they designed it?“ asked Maryann Keller, the principal at Maryann Keller \u0026amp Associates. “My impression was they were talking about this as personal mobility. How could you think that something this large and expensive would be personal mobility?”Ten months after buying the company in 2009, British self-made millionaire Jimi Heselden died after the Segway he was riding careened off a 30ft cliff not far from his country estate at Thorp Arch, West Yorkshire. He was 62 years old.In 2003, George W Bush avoided injury after tumbling off a Segway at his parents’ summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine.A cameraman riding a Segway ran over Usain Bolt in 2015 as the Jamaican sprinter did a victory lap after winning a 200-meter race in Beijing. Bolt wasn’t injured and later joked about the incident.In 2017, Segway got into the scooter business, just as the light, inexpensive and easy-to-ride two-wheelers took over urban streets. Segway’s foray into that industry may have been a sign that its original PT’s days were numbered.“It was probably over-hyped before it was launched, and when it was launched, it was like, this is not going to work on city sidewalks,” Keller said.• This article was amended on 24 June 2020. Jimi Heselden died at his estate in Thorp Arch near Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, and not at “his country estate north of London” as an earlier version said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0069774be8e97d72e037d83b102985d577e70b2/0_356_8260_4956/master/8260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=963ce46286ebece4652a5cf34ec9ee87","title":"britons spend quarter of day online since lockdown says ofcom","story":"Pandemic has sent internet usage soaring and may leave lasting legacy, report saysThe average Briton now spends a quarter of their waking day online, according to new research that shows how internet usage has exploded during the coronavirus pandemic.Ofcom’s annual Online Nation report reveals that at the height of lockdown the average UK adult was spending a daily average of four hours and two minutes online – up from three-and-a-half hours in September last year.This is substantially more time than people spend either watching television or listening to the radio, backing up other indicators that the pandemic has acted as a catalyst to speed up existing trends away from traditional media.Yih-Choung Teh, Ofcom’s director of strategy and research, said: “Lockdown may leave a lasting digital legacy. Coronavirus has radically changed the way we live, work and communicate online, with millions of people using online video services for the first time.”The continued growth in popularity of YouTube is also clear, with a third of Britons now spending more time watching online video than traditional television. Most people now experience the internet – and therefore their world of news and entertainment – through their smartphones rather than through laptop or desktop computers.However, the figures also show one in eight of the population still do not go online at all. This figure has remained stubbornly high for many years and suggests the UK is at risk of having of a class of digital left-behinds.Only half of people over 75 regularly use the internet, while poorer households are also less likely to have internet connections, with most of the holdouts saying they simply don’t see the point of going online. As a result, Ofcom found these groups are often missing out on the transition to online banking as high-street branches close and they also cannot easily access government services such as passport renewal.The lack of access to the internet in some more disadvantaged households has also caused issues for education during the pandemic, as poorer pupils may be unable to use online lessons or other educational resources."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bf71a3f9cbdb523babcbf5cc8a475bd4522914f/47_0_1920_1153/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e52d1d562529f713950733f6fbc92cd","title":"return to camping the quiet site lake district","story":"Confirmation that campsites can open on 4 July has prompted a rush of bookings. For one award-winning eco holiday park in the Lake District, the phone hasn’t stopped ringing...‘The phone started ringing even before he’d finished talking,” says Daniel Holder, referring to Tuesday’s announcement by Boris Johnson that campsites and hotels are allowed to reopen on 4 July. Four of the 12 people employed by Holder, managing director of The Quiet Site, an ultra-green holiday park in Ullswater, Cumbria, were poised to speak to people eager to book a stay at the site. At the same time, Holder was replying as fast as possible to a flood of emails. “We had 206 in the first hour.”It doesn’t surprise me that people are so keen to visit. The Quiet Site is an exceptional place. In April it became the first holiday park in the country to win a Queen’s Award for Enterprise. And the campsite’s post-lockdown credentials are impeccable. With its Hobbit Holes, pods and generously-sized pitches spread out over the large site, social distancing should be easy. Its location on a rural hillside also means visitors are far from the pell-mell of urban life of any sort. And if the enforced isolation has left you starved of soul-easing views, you won’t even have to leave your tent to drink them in. I stayed there last autumn and even though my visit coincided with rather iffy weather, I still had a cracking time.The Quiet Site is high above Ullswater, sheltered by the perfect dome of Little Mell Fell. As well as pitches for tents and campervans, it also has pods (designed by Kendal’s Ian Bone, whose classic “upturned boat” shape you see in many places now), and 15 partially subterranean mega-pods that are as snug as their name suggests.Not one to do things by halves, Holder’s installation of solar panels, extreme insulation and a biomass boiler fired by locally-sourced woodchips has made the site not merely carbon neutral but carbon positive. But if you’re thinking “hairshirt”, think again. My Hobbit Hole came with thermostat-controlled underfloor heating beneath its stone flags. There’s also a microwave, fridge, kettle and a spacious loo.“We want it to be a progressive opening. It wouldn’t be right for our staff or locals if we were full immediately but we will start slowly and build on it as and when we can,” says Holder.When I arrived last year, I did so on a pleasant mostly back-lane cycle from Penrith station. Once I’d settled in and put the kettle on, I sat outside in one of the old school deckchairs, sheltered beneath my new dwelling’s ample awning, and gazed idly out. Beyond a billowing tent and a thicket of trees I spied silvery fragments of Ullswater beneath the broad green brushstroke of Barton Fell. From somewhere behind me, a rook rattled out a throaty cheer.The next day it rained. Undaunted, I ventured out along a section of the Ullswater Way, a 20-mile waymarked footpath. My four-mile walk from the campsite – over the exposed Gowbarrow Fell and down to the waterfalls of Aira Force – was somewhat damp, but the rain did at least ensure that the waterfalls plunged with enough drama to justify the sousing.Helvellyn, that mighty warrior among Cumbrian fells, had burrowed itself away into the clouds and the gusting winds were so ferocious that the Ullswater steamers that ply the mere had been cancelled. I was thankful for a cosy dinner at the award-winning Another Place, a lakeside hotel and restaurant in nearby Watermillock, where I wolfed down a warming coconut katsu with tofu.The next day, armed with a map of the 1618-hectare Lowther estate’s cycle trails, which opened in 2019, I took my electric bicycle to a castle bathed in sunshine.“We’ll have a whip around Askham Fell and take in a couple of neolithic burial chambers and a stone circle.”It’s the kind of sentence I like to hear: full of outdoorsy, nosing-about-in-history promise. It was spoken by Alex, a whip-thin bicycle tour guide. I couldn’t help feeling it was cheating – the fact I’d hired an electric mountain bike for the day – but it did rather take the sting out of the Lake District’s vertiginous inclines. It also meant I could take advantage of the maze of stony, grassy and, at times, gloriously boggy bridleways on the fells and a new network of waymarked cycle trails on the Lowther Castle estate.The greater part of the 1st Earl of Lonsdale’s grand Georgian mansion is a shell. It is the magnificent 52-hectare gardens that are the castle’s glory. At lunch, I headed for Askham Hall’s Kitchen Garden Cafe, a five-minute woodland ride away. I had a tasty artichoke, olive and homemade-pesto pizza from an outdoor wood-fired oven and then wandered about Lowther’s modern parterre – created by rockstar garden designer Dan Pearson.Back at base, I had breakfast served to me by The Quiet Site’s Spicy Sausage food van and dropped in at the excellent on-site zero-waste shop. There I borrowed some washed-up containers and filled them with popping corn and sugar in preparation for a late-night treat, adding rather healthier muesli for the morning. Since my stay the van has gone but the zero-waste shop has been open for locals throughout lockdown.Undoubtedly the most surprising thing about The Quiet Site is its bar. Yes, I know: campsite bars are where dreams go to die. As I entered The Quiet Bar, my expectation meter was showing high levels of trepidation. What I found was a traditional 17th-century Cumbrian Long Barn converted in the 1960s and lit by fairy lights wrapped around beams, making it positively murky … but in a good way. A couple of rustic wooden galleries were filled with extra settees and old church pews. They were needed, too: despite it being a damp Tuesday night the bar was buzzing. Happily, it reopens on 4 July – it will be seating only and table service but the beer will be just as good.I sampled a draught Ullswater Blonde, the local Tirril brewery’s very more-ish pale best bitter, and watched that night’s billed entertainment: a very young man in black tie shimmying from table to table doing polished little magic tricks as if we were in Vegas. To top it off, the bar staff had a simple but brilliant music policy: if David Bowie didn’t sing it, they didn’t play it.

It’s also amazing entertainment for the entire familyHere’s a confession, and not a particularly great one for somebody paid to write about television: I have struggled with TV under lockdown. It has been difficult to find anything that fits my mood at any given time. I don’t have the energy to sit through a brave, new complicated series, but at the same time I struggle to see the point of anything deliberately lightweight. My viewing history for the last few months is essentially a pile of shows that were picked up and quickly dropped.So it is with some relief that I have found something I can watch. Something that fits perfectly into the part of my brain that I want to switch off. I can watch it on my own or with my kids. It’s new. It’s silly enough to be erting, but requires almost no participation on my part. It is Netflix’s Floor Is Lava, and I’m lucky to have it.This is how I imagine the commissioning process for Floor Is Lava went. Someone walked into the Netflix office and found somebody in charge. They said the words “Floor is lava” out loud, and, two seconds, later walked out with a commission for a 10-part series. It’s the sort of idea that makes you angry for how obvious it is. It’s been staring us in the face for decades, but nobody thought to make it until now.In essence, Floor Is Lava is a souped-up version of the game you played as kids, where you have to traverse a room without touching the floor except here the “floor” is 80,000 gallons of bubbling, bright-red water. If you fall from an obstacle, you’re submerged and out of the game. It’s Takeshi’s Castle. It’s Total Wipeout. It’s The Crystal Maze. It’s Ninja Warrior. It teeters right on the line that separates stupidity from genius. Everybody should be watching it.Every episode is the same, with just enough surface-level changes to keep you watching. Three teams of three people have to get from one side of a room to another by clinging to walls and leaping from boxes and dangling from ropes. In episode one the room is explorer themed, with pyramids, sarcophagi and cargo nets. Episode two is more traditionally furnished, with a bed, sofas and trunks. I cannot tell you the theme of episode three because by that point my kids had caught wind of it and stood entranced shoulder to shoulder in front of the screen, blocking my view.If the contestants fall, and they usually fall, they fail. If by some triumph of the human spirit they all make it, they win a prize. One of the genius aspects of Floor Is Lava is just how small the prize is. The winners get $10,000 between them – which works out at less than £3,000 each – and a crappy gift shop lava lamp that’s listlessly tossed at them by the host, Rutledge Wood.The other great thing about Floor Is Lava is a sleight of hand. When a contestant falls into the “lava”, we never see them come up for air. They sink beneath the surface and that’s the end of them. It’s the simplest edit, but it introduces a truly berserk level of jeopardy into the game. There is a very strong chance that it will permanently traumatise your children, who may not possess a particularly strong grasp of modern post-production techniques, but it elevates the show tenfold.More than anything, Floor Is Lava is fun. It won’t win any awards. It won’t make any end-of-year lists. But as a piece of pure entertainment, it succeeds fully. When you watch it, you’ll wish you were playing it. I’m desperate for a second season because I want to fully exploit my position and try out the course for the spurious purposes of an article. If Netflix executives have any sense, the first thing they will do post-Covid-19 is open up a bunch of experiential Floor Is Lava centres so the public can try it for themselves. Floor Is Lava is great. It has saved lockdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a99b059d2683470dae38188ad564faf56270814/0_0_5445_3267/master/5445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0987bca7a0b7f30e3ba8aa7348c88123","title":"tv tonight the story of wu tang clan in their own words","story":"The seminal hip-hop collective tell their tale.

The former president and the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee also hosted a private online portion for high-dollar donors, which was not open to reporters, and brought in more than $3.4m.It was the most money raised by a single event by the former vice-president so far during his presidential campaign, and came on the heels of the Democratic party and Biden’s campaign out-raising Donald Trump in May for the first time.At the event, however, Obama urged viewers to learn the lessons from 2016 and not take the election for granted. Referencing what he called a “great awakening” among younger Americans pushing for reforms, Obama said that “just because this energy is out there does not mean that it assures our victory and it does not mean that it gets channeled in a way that results in real change.”“There’s a backlash, that is fierce, against change,” Obama added.The Trump campaign has so far been ahead in overall fundraising, with $265m in cash at the end of May. Trump’s Dallas fundraiser earlier this month raised north of $10m for the campaign, Republican National Committee and the Trump Victory Fund. Biden and the Democrats had a combined $122m, Reuters reported, though the former vice-president’s fundraising efforts appear to have picked up in recent weeks.The fundraiser marked Obama’s official return to the presidential campaign trail and underscored his unmatched popularity within the Democratic party.Tuesday’s event was a kickoff of what Obama’s team says will likely be a busy schedule heading into the fall, as he looks to help elect not just Biden but Democrats running for House and Senate. And his comments suggest Democrats are taking very seriously the possibility that their base could grow too comfortable this fall, with a number of state and nationwide surveys showing Biden with significant, often double-digit leads over Trump.Democrats are hoping Obama’s appeal, especially among Black and younger voters, can help boost energy for Biden.“There’s two groups of voters that Biden needs to move,” said Dan Pfeiffer, the former White House communications director. “You have the 4 million Obama 2012 voters that sat out in ’16, Obama obviously has cache with them. And you have to persuade some number of voters who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and either Trump or a third-party candidate in 2016, and Obama obviously is very, very high-performing with those as well.”Indeed, during Tuesday night’s fundraiser, Obama made a frequent pitch directly to young voters, telling them he was “hopeful” about the new energy he’s seen but warning them not to get discouraged with a political process he said “is always going to be slower” and “less satisfactory” than engaging with a social movement through public demonstrations.Obama endorsed Biden with a video message in April, but kept an otherwise low profile throughout the primary and largely avoided wading into national politics. In recent weeks, however, he’s re-emerged publicly to speak out on policing and the civil unrest that followed the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.Some Democrats say that, in the wake of Floyd’s killing, Obama’s voice as an advocate for Biden and a leader for the party is needed.“Biden doesn’t have the strongest record on criminal justice reform so having Obama there is helpful in reinforcing that issue,” said Ben Tulchin, who polled for Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign.“Given what’s going on with criminal justice reform and Black Lives Matter, having the first African American president out there publicly backing Biden is extremely helpful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df5d5bc8b4601b2413b29532962d9394f801895e/90_0_1917_1151/master/1917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eea5470b33572a48141c39d3e4faad5d","title":"whole foods bottled water arsenic found","story":"Tests by Consumer Reports find toxic metal in Starkey Spring Water, which was previously recalled for exceeding federal limits, and is sold on AmazonBottled water manufactured by Whole Foods and sold in most of its US stores and on Amazon contains potentially harmful levels of arsenic, according to new tests by Consumer Reports (CR).CR recently tested dozens of bottled water brands and found that Starkey Spring Water, introduced by Whole Foods in 2015, had concerning levels of arsenic, ranging from 9.49 to 9.56 parts per billion (PPB), at least three times the level of every other brand tested. Federal regulations require manufacturers to limit the amount of arsenic, a potentially dangerous heavy metal, in bottled water to 10 PPB. CR experts believe that level does not adequately protect public health.CR also tested samples of Starkey Spring Water in 2019, finding levels of arsenic that approached or exceeded the federal limit: three samples ranged from 9.48 to 9.86 PPB of arsenic a fourth registered 10.1 PPB. Those results are cited in two pending consumer lawsuits over Starkey’s arsenic content.Drinking a single bottle of Starkey probably will not harm you, says Dr James Dickerson, CR’s chief scientific officer. “But regular consumption of even small amounts of the heavy metal over extended periods increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, and lower IQ scores in children, and poses other health issues as well,” he says.The results of the testing come as the  and Consumer Reports launch a major project this week on the challenges of getting access to safe, clean, affordable water in the US. That includes how the bottled water consumers sometimes resort to as an alternative is not only expensive, but may also not always be safer.“I think the average consumer would be stunned to learn that they’re paying a lot of extra money for bottled water, thinking that it’s significantly safer than tap, and unknowingly getting potentially dangerous levels of arsenic,” says Erik Olson, senior strategic director of health and food at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy organization that has researched bottled water quality.Issues include contaminated water, concerns that millions face obstacles to access safe, clean running water, a growing affordability crisis, plus rising alarm about the billion-dollar bottled water industry’s use of public water sources at low cost.While drinking tap water is often the best and safest option for people in the US, some communities, often those with vulnerable or marginalized residents, face health risks from drinking water that has been affected by some form of contaminant.The US is experiencing a growing water poverty crisis as aging infrastructure, environmental clean-ups, changing demographics and the climate emergency fuel exponential price hikes in almost every corner of the country.The consequence is millions of ordinary Americans are facing rising and unaffordable bills for running water, and risk being disconnected or losing their homes if they cannot pay.CR’s findings highlight inconsistencies with how water is regulated in the US. Research suggests health risks from arsenic can emerge below the federal limit of 10 PPB, especially in children, prompting two states, New Jersey and New Hampshire, to lower their level to 5 PPB. Those limits, however, only apply to tap water.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which regulates municipal water in the US, allows states to set their own standards for tap water, so long as they’re at least as strict as the federal level. But federal bottled water regulations, which are enforced by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), generally prohibit states from creating more stringent limits for contaminants in bottled water.That puts Starkey Spring Water in the unusual position of being legal when put in a bottle but, in certain states, illegal if it came out of a household faucet.A spokesperson for Amazon, which owns Whole Foods and sells Starkey online for $1.99 in a plastic bottle, deferred to the grocery chain’s communications team. A Whole Foods spokesperson told CR that the company’s “highest priority is to provide customers with safe, high-quality and refreshing spring water”.“Beyond the required annual testing by an FDA certified lab, we have an accredited third-party lab test every production run of water before it is sold,” the spokesperson says. “These products meet all FDA requirements and are fully compliant with FDA standards for heavy metals.”An FDA spokesperson says that the arsenic levels CR found in Starkey Spring Water meet the agency’s standard for the heavy metal. The agency also says that arsenic is a naturally occurring element and “it is not possible to remove arsenic entirely from the environment or food supply”.But many of the 45 brands of bottled water CR scientists tested between February and May of this year had undetectable amounts of arsenic, demonstrating that lower levels are feasible, says Brian Ronholm, CR’s director of food policy and former head of the US Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service. Starkey Spring Water was the only brand CR tested that exceeded 3 PPB.The FDA, which has not updated its bottled water standard for arsenic in 15 years, says the current limit ensures that the quality of bottled water is, at a minimum, comparable to public drinking water. CR urged the agency last year to lower the federal limit  to 3 PPB, a level that more clearly protects public health, especially for children, Ronholm says.Ronholm said customers paying a premium for a “potentially risky product” was a bad deal for consumers. “Being fully compliant with FDA’s allowable levels for arsenic is a claim that rings hollow when you consider it’s an outdated standard that is inferior to tap water in certain states. The FDA’s standard needs to be updated to be more consistent with public health goals.”Consumer Reports bought all the bottled water samples anonymously at retail, like a consumer would, and then tested them for heavy metals, including arsenic.Whole Foods introduced Starkey Spring Water in 2015, with chief operating officer AC Gallo telling investors “it’s amazingly pristine water” that “naturally flows out of the ground” from a spring in Idaho. That point is reinforced on the product’s label, which declares that Starkey is “made by Mother Nature”.But in December 2016, records show that the FDA was notified of tests conducted by Florida’s bottled water regulator showing that Starkey had 11.7 PPB of arsenic, which is above the federal safety threshold. Weeks later, additional tests found 12 PPB of arsenic in samples taken from other lots. The FDA told Whole Foods about the results, saying the findings could warrant a recall, and asked how the company planned to respond, according to FDA records obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. The FDA noted the potential health risks –including cancer, skin lesions, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.Whole Foods responded to the findings by recalling more than 2,000 cases of Starkey Spring Water in late 2016 and early 2017.Since then, the company’s own internal tests continue to show arsenic levels at 8 PPB – lower than the levels CR found.In California, state law requires bottlers to provide consumers an easy-to-read report detailing the quality of their product. If a bottled water has arsenic levels above 5 PPB, the company must include a disclaimer in those reports noting the elevated levels. Consumers often can find the report on a company’s website or by contacting the manufacturer directly.“Arsenic levels above 5 PPB and up to 10 PPB are present in your drinking water,” the disclaimer in the Starkey Spring Water report reads. “While your drinking water meets the current EPA standard for arsenic, it does contain low levels of arsenic.”California’s Department of Public Health says it requires these warnings because it requires similar statements from community water systems, and wants the standards for bottled water and tap water to be aligned.Studies examining the effect of drinking water with levels of arsenic below 10 PPB have been ongoing for years.A 2014 study in the journal Environmental Health found that an arsenic level of 5 PPB or greater in a child’s household water supply was associated with a five- to six-point reduction in IQ, compared to those with arsenic levels below 5 PPB. And researchers at Dartmouth’s Toxic Metal Superfund Research Program have found that long-term exposure to lower levels of arsenic can increase the risk of certain cancers and may be linked to heart disease and diabetes.New Hampshire regulators relied in part on that research when it recommended in December 2018 to lower the state’s tap water limit for arsenic to 5 PPB. The new limit goes into effect on 1 July 2021.Kathy Remillard, public information officer for the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, says the state now plans to lower the arsenic limit for bottled water distributed in the state to that same 5 PPB level.While federal bottled water regulations generally preempt state laws, the FDA confirmed that New Hampshire could set a stricter limit, so long as it applied only to products manufactured and sold in the state.New Jersey set a 5 PPB cutoff for arsenic in tap water in 2006. Water with arsenic above 5 PPB shouldn’t be used for “drinking, cooking, mixing baby formula, or in other consumptive ways,” the state says in a consumer advisory.But, due to the FDA’s preemption over state laws, New Jersey has no plans to consider limiting bottled water to a 5 PPB arsenic limit, a spokesperson says.After CR published results from its initial tests of Starkey Spring Water in 2019, several consumers pursued legal action against Whole Foods, which calls itself America’s Healthiest Grocery Store.David Berke, a California resident, bought Starkey Water based on Whole Foods’ “reputation and long-running multi-media campaign for sourcing and selling safe, wholesome and healthy products,” according to a proposed class action lawsuit he filed last year.“This is hardly what Whole Foods shoppers bargained for,” the lawsuit alleges. “Plaintiff and other purchasers of Starkey Water paid a hefty premium – especially as compared to tap water – because they were and still are led to believe Starkey Water is the healthiest and least contaminated bottled water.”In court, Whole Foods has denied Berke’s claims, saying they lack merit and are an attempt by him to “use state consumer protection laws to regulate trace amounts of arsenic in Starkey”.In a separate action, Illinois siblings Lorenzo and Vienna Colucci filed a proposed class action suit against Whole Foods over Starkey’s arsenic level. Lorenzo Colucci is a stage four cancer survivor “who is keenly aware of the dangers of carcinogens,” according to the complaint.“Had he known the water contained arsenic in much higher amounts than other commercially available brands,” the suit said, “he would not have purchased it.”Whole Foods has yet to respond in court to Colucci’s case. A spokesperson says the company doesn’t comment on pending litigation. Carrie Laliberte, co-counsel for Berke and the Coluccis, also declined to comment, citing the ongoing case.To find information about the amount of arsenic and other contaminants in a particular brand of bottled water, look for the water quality test report from the company on its website, or check the bottle’s label for contact information. Look for brands that report nondetectable levels of arsenic. But also make a point to review the entire report for other listed contaminants. While there is no central repository of such reports, CR has gathered reports published through early 2019 for numerous brands.If you are interested in the quality of your tap water, you can check its quality by getting a copy of your local water utility’s annual report or by having your water tested. And if you have high amounts of arsenic or other contaminants, you could use a water filter for your drinking water.

His press secretary later said the remarks were “in jest” but the president stood by them on Tuesday, telling reporters that the comments weren’t a joke.Speaking to the congressional committee hours later, however, Fauci said: “I know for sure that to my knowledge none of us have ever been told to slow down on testing. That just is a fact. In fact, we will be doing more testing.”Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, spoke to the committee alongside Redfield the head of the Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn and a top official at the Department of Health and Human Services, Brett Giroir.Fauci last testified before Congress in May, when states were still mostly shut down. Since then staggered reopenings have taken place across the country, and several states are seeing a concerning increase in cases.He said the state of coronavirus in the US was overall a “mixed bag”, in part because of the country’s huge size and ersity.He said some areas, such as New York City, had done well to rein in cases by following the government’s guidelines for reopening, but said the “disturbing surge” in infections in other parts of the country was very concerning.“The next couple of weeks are going to be critical to address those surges we’re seeing,” Fauci said, specifically citing the increase in cases in Florida, Arizona and Texas.The concerns shared by top health leaders at the hearing contradicted Trump’s continued efforts to downplay the effects of Covid-19.At least eight Trump campaign staffers tested positive for Covid-19 in Tulsa, where Trump told a campaign rally that he had asked administration officials to slow down testing, because too many positive cases are turning up.After administration figures including White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany suggested the comments weren’t serious or were a joke, Trump on Tuesday said: “I never kid.”“Testing is a double-edged sword,” Trump told reporters. “One way, it shows you have cases and in another way you find out where the cases are and you do a good job.”When asked inidually at the congressional hearing if the president had asked the US health leaders to slow down testing, they all responded “no”.At the time of the May hearing, Fauci was one of many speakers to testify from a video feed at home. This time, the speakers were in person for this hearing.In the chamber, the men sat with tubs of disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer pumps next to their nameplates. While committee members and speakers are usually packed tight, people sat at a distance, wearings masks, which they removed to speak.Fauci told the committee he was “cautiously optimistic” that a vaccine would be ready at the end of the year or early 2021. The group also expressed concern about what could happen if coronavirus cases were still high when flu season arrives in the autumn.In a prepared statement, the experts said such a collision could again burden the country’s healthcare system.“If there is Covid-19 and flu activity at the same time, this could place a tremendous burden on the healthcare system related to bed occupancy, laboratory testing needs, personal protective equipment and healthcare worker safety,” the statement said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ed433391d3489f33e6539028f7be0e5744007bd/252_334_4362_2618/master/4362.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e89eedd48495f19746f1503ba926a294","title":"big tobacco wants our youths lungs rise of smoking in jordan","story":"Despite one of the world’s highest smoking rates, many politicians believe a ban will affect the economyby  Michael Safi and Jassar Al-Tahat in AmmanWhen patients quit cigarettes at the King Hussein Cancer Center’s smoking clinic they are asked to be patient with their children. Often their offspring have been exposed to so much secondhand smoke that they have become addicted, too.“For every four cigarettes their parent has smoked, the child has smoked one,” says Firas al-Hawari, a physician who directs the clinic. “We can control the parents with medication, but the kids are going through withdrawals because we don’t have them on medication.”Figures published by the  on Tuesday show that the Middle Eastern kingdom of Jordan has surpassed Indonesia to have the highest smoking rates in the world. Including e-cigarettes and other “smokeless” products, more than eight in 10 Jordanian men are nicotine users, according to a 2019 national survey carried out in collaboration with the World Health Organization.Jordanian men who smoke daily consume an average of 23 cigarettes a day, the survey found. “In Jordan we consider someone who smokes a pack a day to be a light smoker,” Hawari says. “We have people who smoke three, five, seven packs a day. It is like it was in the 1950s or 1960s in other places.”The proliferation of tobacco is obvious on a summer night in the country’s capital, Amman. Thick smoke wafts from water pipes and cigarettes in the courtyards of cafes and restaurants that have recently emerged from the country’s stringent coronavirus lockdown. Officials nonchalantly smoke in government offices, many of which are fitted with no-smoking signs. Even hospitals struggle to enforce bans in a country where more than a third of doctors are smokers, according to a 2013 survey.Jordanians with conditions such as asthma can end up planning their lives around avoiding smoke. “They smoked all the time: at their desks, in the hallways, in the bathroom,” says Ruba Madhadha of her colleagues at the government agency where she worked. “I used to run away to my car to do emails, just to keep doing my job.”For a few months she used steroid inhalers to manage her condition, but she finally had to leave the office in January. Smoking was officially banned in the building, she says. “But nobody does anything – no fines, no punishment.”The impacts of so much smoking are already stark: tobacco use is linked to one in eight deaths in the country, compared with one in 10 deaths worldwide, and costs Jordan’s GDP an estimated three times the global average.But Hawari say the true scale of the problem will be known in about 2030, when a bulk of the country’s disproportionately young population reaches 40 – the age at which tobacco-related illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, start to manifest. “It’s going to cause an enormous surge in non-communicable diseases that we won’t be able to handle,” he says.Surveys show tobacco use is still growing, on the back of a rise in women taking up the habit and the popularity of water pipes, which doctors say can be equivalent to consuming approximately three packs of cigarettes over a 45-minute session.The emergence of e-cigarettes, marketed as a tool to help people stop smoking, have so far led to more people using nicotine overall than quitting cigarettes, according to the 2019 nationalWHO statistics.Smoking used to be endemic in wealthier countries such as the US, Australia and many in Europe. But decades of aggressive public health campaigns and restrictions on the ability of tobacco companies to advertise and lobby have succeeded in dramatically cutting their smoking rates.Many of those corporate tactics have now migrated to countries in the Middle East and Africa, where regulations are more lax and poorly enforced, suggests Raouf Alebshehy, a monitoring coordinator in the tobacco control research group at the University of Bath. The majority of the world’s smokers now live in middle- and lower-income countries.Analysts suspect smoking rates may be just as high in countries such as Iraq, Lebanon and Syria – Jordan is just advanced and stable enough to be able to measure its problem.“What makes the Middle East region special in terms of its smoking rates?” Alebshehy says. “It isn’t lack of information. It’s a closed case that tobacco is harmful. One of the important factors we have found in this region is that the multinational companies started to invest and expand here. They started to shift work from developed markets to emerging markets here and in Africa where tobacco demand is still growing, and they bought up local manufacturers.”Jordan has the most tobacco company interference in policymaking in the world after Japan, according to a 2019 analysis by a civil society group. “Big tobacco is preying on our countries, wanting to really own the lungs of our youth,” says Princess Dina Mired, the president of the Union for International Cancer Control and a member of the country’s royal family. “And they are doing so successfully.”Many in government do not see a problem. Smoking is not even banned in the Jordanian parliament. When lawmakers tried to do so in 2004, a report in the Jordan Times says they had to reverse the decision as meetings started losing quorum because too many MPs were outside have a cigarette.“Members of parliament tell me: ‘This is an economic matter, you are affecting the Jordanian economy and threatening the jobs of people working in the industry’,” says Mervat Mheerat, the deputy manager for health in Greater Amman Municipality. “They correlate tobacco with the economy. And that’s the message they get from the tobacco industry.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86466843d6e17a6413acb5810de4564f3071126d/0_335_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77c90387bde1d3bd9bb5fdf5dce73e21","title":"easing of lockdown rules in england whats reopening on 4 july","story":"How PM’s latest announcement affects pubs and restaurants, hairdressers and galleriesThe government’s lockdown rules to control coronavirus are easing on 4 July in England to allow many more businesses, as well as leisure facilities, to reopen, with other measures also relaxed.A new “1-metre-plus” concept has been introduced. This means it is now possible to be 1 metre away from someone outside your household instead of 2 metres, so long as there is another mitigating factor in place, such as a screen or face-covering, or hand-washing facilities. The changes also allow one household of up to six people to spend time with another household indoors, including staying the night, but they should remain physically distant. Pubs and restaurants in England can reopen both outdoors and indoors in what the government calls a “covid-secure way” with more hand-washing, ventilation and table service indoors, rather than customers standing at a shared bar. People may be asked to give their names but pub landlords will not check the exact makeup of an inidual household that comes into the venue or request to see identification. They will not be asked to wear face-coverings. A household will be able to meet with one other household at a time in a pub or restaurant, then choose another household on another occasion. Nightclubs will not yet be reopening, nor will casinos, and the government has said there will be taskforces to ensure more businesses can open as quickly as possible.Hotels, bed and breakfasts, holiday homes and campsites and caravan parks and boarding houses will be able to reopen. Campsites will be given guidance on how to be “covid-secure” in shared areas such as shower, toilet and washing-up facilities. Work remains to be done on how hostels, where there are shared sleeping spaces, can reopen safely and they will not be ready for 4 July.Instead of keeping a distance of 2 metres from other passengers, it will be possible to travel 1 metre apart so long as another mitigating factor is in place, such as a face-coverings which are mandatory. This will help more people get on to trains, buses and trams.They will be able to reopen but not for live performances, as the government say they want to protect the health of performers. They could show previous work on a screen. Cafes, bars and restaurants associated with the venue would be able to reopen, however. Museums and galleries can also reopen. Concerts and outdoor music festivals will not be permitted as mass gatherings are still banned.Gyms, indoor studios, indoor sports facilities, swimming pools and water parks will not be reopening yet but outdoor gyms in parks – many of which have been taped up by councils since March – will be. Popular events such as park runs, and large running groups, are not due to make a comeback just yet as they are classed as a mass gathering. The reason gym-like venues are remaining closed for now is the level of breathing involved, which is a risk factor in the virus’ spread.These have been open for private prayer since 13 June but the changes mean more of the congregation can attend so long as the building’s staff follow guidance on how to control the virus. Singing will be banned, so there could be a Sunday church service but held without the hymns.Weddings can be held as places of worship reopen. However, after the service the couple will only be able to go to a hospitality venue with one other household – making any celebration small-scale and forcing couples to chose between different sides of a family. At the moment, the maximum number of people from one household that can mix with another household in an indoor venue is six.Hairdressers and barbers can open and have been booking in clients for a number of weeks anticipating the change. Nail bars, massage and tattoo parlours will not be reopening because of concerns about the risk of transmission. However, the government says it hopes to get them reopened within weeks and that they are working closely with the sector on how this could be possible.Funfairs, theme parks, adventure parks, amusement arcades, model villages, aquariums, wildlife centres, zoos and safari parks can all reopen on 4 July, which will give families far more scope for days out. However, bowling alleys, indoor skating, indoor play areas including soft play will not be reopening for now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ae5e66432f009630410252b8832e92ab20d983/220_540_4451_2671/master/4451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6370f4df7abc85f6c8675282f233f7df","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about coming out of lockdown","story":"Lockdown restrictions are to be eased from 6 July and we want to hear how you feel about itFrom 6 July, people in England with underlying health issues who have been shielding since March will be allowed to leave their homes.They will be able to meet up outside in groups of up to six people from different households, provided they keep 2 metres apart, and they will no longer have to remain 2 metres apart from the rest of their household at home.If you have been shielding since March we would like to hear how you feel about lockdown restrictions easing.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

Last year’s summit between Kim and Donald Trump in Hanoi broke down after the leaders disagreed on what measures the North should take before Washington agreed to relieve sanctions.Last week, Kim’s influential younger sister, Kim Yo-jong, threatened unspecified retaliation, while the North’s general staff suggested it would send troops to Mount Kumgang and Kaesong, both located near the heavily armed border.In addition, the general staff threatened to reoccupy border guard posts that had been abandoned under the 2018 deal, agreed during a summit between Kim Jong-un and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in.There was speculation that North Korea would also launch its own propaganda war by bombarding South Korea with millions of leaflets. And on Tuesday, media reports said the North had installed loudspeakers along the border that had been removed after the Kim-Moon summit.The 38 North website, which monitors North Korea, speculated that the rise in anti-South rhetoric in recent weeks had given the regime “just enough room to de-escalate”, but added that the prospects for détente remained slim.“Even if North Korea avoids a serious escalation of tensions, it is still unlikely to pursue further diplomacy with the Moon administration anytime in the near future,” it said in a commentary, adding that Pyongyang could instead direct its criticism towards the US."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d3a19df01dc39d592752615266d6e13b372b61/0_298_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=4e90010a3fc492d11705d0e94289270a","title":"wednesday briefing holiday hopes as pm eases lockdown","story":"‘Air bridges’ to European holiday destinations could open soon … scientists temper Johnson’s optimism … end of the road for SegwaysMorning everyone.

Cross-party opposition rallied against the proposal because they said it would risk turning the Commons into a “bully pulpit” and would make it more difficult for victims to come forward. Tory MP Andrea Leadsom argued that the plan, even with constraints, would “result in a complainant feeling re-victimised”.American ‘awakening’ – Barack Obama has helped Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden to raise $11m in fundraising events as the party gears up for the November election.

The ancient Thai city has been overrun by a growing population of monkeys super-charged on junk food – as locals try to placate the macaques with snacks. The monkeys usually enjoy a steady supply of bananas from tourists, who have dwindled amid the coronavirus pandemic.Pointing to the overhead netting covering her terrace, Kuljira Taechawattanawanna said: “We live in a cage but the monkeys live outside.”“Their excrement is everywhere, the smell is unbearable especially when it rains,” she says from her home in the 13th-century city.The fearless primates’ antics were largely tolerated as a major lure for the tourist hordes who descended on the city before the coronavirus outbreak to feed and snap selfies with the plucky animals.But a government sterilisation campaign is now being waged against the creatures after the epidemic provoked an unexpected change in their behaviour.As foreign tourism - Thailand’s cash cow – seized up so did the flow of free bananas tossed their way, prodding the macaques to turn to violence.Footage of hundreds of them brawling over food in the streets went viral on social media in March. Their growing numbers – doubling in three years to 6,000 – have made an uneasy coexistence with their human peers almost intolerable.An abandoned cinema is the macaques’ headquarters. Nearby, a shop owner displays stuffed tiger and crocodile toys to try to scare off the monkeys, who regularly snatch spray-paint cans from his store.Nobody in Lopburi seems to remember a time without the monkeys, with some speculating that the urban creep into nearby forest displaced the simians into the city. Residents have taken it upon themselves to feed the macaques to prevent clashes. But locals say the sugary diet of fizzy drinks, cereal and sweets has fuelled their sex lives.“The more they eat, the more energy they have ... so they breed more,” says Pramot Ketampai, who manages the Prang Sam Yod temple’s surrounding shrines.The macaques’ mob fights have drawn the attention of authorities, who restarted a sterilisation programme this month after a three-year pause. Wildlife department officers lure the animals into cages with fruit and take them to a clinic where they are anaesthetised, sterilised and left with a tattoo to mark their neutering. They aim to fix 500 of the creatures by Friday.But the campaign may not be enough to quell their numbers and the department has a long-term plan to build a sanctuary in another part of the city. This will likely be met with resistance from the human residents.“We need to do a survey of the people living in the area first,” said Narongporn Daudduem from the wildlife department. “It’s like dumping garbage in front of their houses and asking them if they’re happy or not.”Taweesak Srisaguan, the shop owner in Lopburi, said that despite his daily joust with the creatures, he will miss them if they are moved. “I’m used to seeing them walking around, playing on the street,” he says. “If they’re all gone, I’d definitely be lonely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e192afe7f5169403038b0c324c8ecf29f8bd452/0_360_5394_3236/master/5394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9242fe019c675354b0c1aa8d051772b1","title":"coronavirus live news update dr fauci disturbing us case surge brazil covid 19 infections cases latest updates","story":"Deaths in Latin America pass 100,000 Fauci warns of ‘disturbing’ US cases surge Brazil records 39,436 new cases 200 cases at one South African schoolIndonesian authorities complained on Wednesday that hundreds of people had refused testing for the new coronavirus as social taboos emerge as another obstacle to stopping its spread in the world*s fourth-most populous nation. The country has the highest number of reported infections in Southeast Asia, surpassing 49,000, while at least 2,573 people have died, according to official data, the highest COVID-19 death toll in East Asia outside China. Despite an acceleration in infections, this week hundreds of traditional traders in Bali and Sumatra refused to get tested, even as bustling, densely packed markets have emerged as common coronavirus infection points, officials said. Ukraine is opening more of its hospitals to coronavirus cases as the institutions initially chosen to accept patients no longer have enough beds to cope with a surge in infections, the health minister said on Wednesday. The daily rise of coronavirus cases hit a new high of 940 on Wednesday, bringing the total to 39,014, with 1,051 deaths. Most new cases were registered in west Ukraine and the capital. At the start of the epidemic, Ukraine ided hospitals into categories, with the best prepared institutions taking patients in the first wave. Second-line hospitals would accept cases once the other institutions had no more places. Officials say some citizens have not stuck closely enough to guidance on social distancing and other precautions to prevent the virus spreading, leading to a surge in cases. Paris women’s fashion week is to go ahead in September, the organisers said Wednesday.The French Haute Couture and Fashion Federation said it will be held between September 28 and October 6 and “comply with the recommendations of the authorities” on the coronavirus.Paris fashion week is by far the world’s biggest and most important.With fashionistas deprived of runway shows since March, thousands are expected to descend on the French capital to see the spring summer 2021 collections.The pandemic has turned the fashion calendar upside-down, with Paris men’s and haute couture fashion shows next month being held online.France’s coronavirus contact-tracing app StopCovid has alerted just 14 people that they have been near someone with the virus in the three weeks it has been launched.Only 68 people have signalled they have tested positive for the virus on the application.Digital minister Cédric O said the application had been downloaded and activated 1.8m times on the Android and Apple devices since it was launched on 2 June, but had been subsequently uninstalled by 460,000. “I have to admit, the question of the number of notifications, which is quite low, has surprised us,” the minister told a press conference. He attributed the low number of people reporting they had tested positive for Covid-19 on the application to “the weak prevalence of the epidemic” in France where the number of cases is dropping daily and the daily death toll is now in the low double figures.By contrast, Germany’s coronavirus application, launched last week, has been downloaded 10m times. O said this was down to “cultural differences” between the two countries.“The epidemic is not over we are discovering new cluster cases every day. StopCovid is an additional tool to gain time in discovering these cases,” said Maurice-Pierre Planel, deputy director general of France’s general health directorate at the ministry of health.France decided not to use contact applications developed by American technology giants Apple and Google but to develop its own. The country’s data, information and privacy authority cleared StopCovid for use.However, the investigative website Mediapart contested the government’s claim that the app would gather mobile phone pseudonyms of those who had tested positive for the virus with whom the user had been in contact at a distance of less than 1 metre for more than 15 minutes. Mediapart claimed StopCovid was hoovering up anonymous information on all iniduals users came in contact with during the previous 14 days.O said the application had to evolve to warn the population of “the second wave … that everyone is envisaging”. In the long term, the government is hoping StopCovid can be made to work with the apps used by France’s EU neighbours.France now has just under 9,500 people in hospital with the coronavirus and 682 in intensive care. The number of hospital deaths rose by 26 in the previous 24 hours according to official figures. Indonesia reported 1,113 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, taking its total number of cases to 49,009. Health ministry official Achmad Yurianto said there were 38 more deaths reported, with total fatalities now at 2,573. Afghanistan resumed international flights after a three months-long pause as it has recorded its lowest daily infections since 13 May, amid a dropping number of daily tests.Turkish Airlines will be the first aviation company that resumes its flights from Kabul to Turkey after almost three months. The flights will be under special health measures, according to company officials.Afghan officials said that local aviation companies have also resumed their abroad flights. “We have imposed mandatory measures for health safety in order to begin our flights, local companies have also resumed their flights,” said Mohammad Qasim Wafaeezada, head of Afghanistan’s Civil Aviation Authority.The country’s health ministry has detected 234 new coronavirus infections to coronavirus – the lowest daily rise since 13 May – from 651 tests in the last 24 hours as 21 more patients died from the virus, taking the total number of infections to 29,715 and the death toll to 639. There have been 9,869 recoveries.The health ministry had previously said that it was unable to increase testing due to a lack of laboratories and an overload of suspected patients, adding medical workers would determine new coronavirus patients through their symptoms, rather than tests. The health ministry has said multiple times it has capacity of 2,000 tests a day, but never reached the number.Kabul still leads new daily infections as most new cases (124) have been reported in the capital and four patients died from the virus overnight. Kabul is the country’s worst-affected area in both the number of confirmed cases and deaths with 12,309 cases and 151 deaths.Most new deaths were reported in the western province of Herat as 11 patients died from the virus overnight.Meanwhile, the war is raging on with full intensity across the country as 17 Taliban and four security forces were killed in a clash in Helmand on Tuesday night after the Taliban attacked security checkpoints, local officials said on Wednesday.The western province of Badghis was also a battlefield last night as at least 10 security forces were killed in a Taliban attack. Last week was the “deadliest” in 19 years of war as at least 988 Afghan security forces and civilians were killed and wounded, according to the country’s National Security Council.Bulgaria will extend a state of emergency declared in response to the coronavirus outbreak until 15 July after another jump in new registered cases, health minister Kiril Ananiev said on Wednesday. The country began to relax restrictions to stop the spread of the virus earlier this month, but last week it reported 606 new Covid-19 cases, its highest weekly rise since the beginning of the epidemic.Some 130 new cases were reported on Wednesday, bringing the total to date to 4,114, with 208 deaths. The latest jump prompted Ananiev’s decision to reimpose the mask requirement at all indoor public venues, including trains and buses. Kyrgyz President Sooronbay Jeenbekov missed a world war two victory parade in Russia on Wednesday after two people who accompanied him on the flight to Moscow tested positive for Covid-19 on arrival, his office said. The parade, marking the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany, was postponed from 9 May because of the coronavirus outbreak. Jeenbekov had been scheduled to attend alongside several other leaders from former Soviet republics. Leaders who were absent included Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, who told Russian President Vladimir Putin that he would have to mark his birthday in quarantine if he chose to attend. Jeenbekov’s office did not identify the officials who had tested positive. The Kyrgyz government has said it may have to re-tighten restrictions in the country of 6.5 million following a resurgence of Covid-19.

Meanwhile, several countries continued to loosen up, including in Britain where pubs, restaurants, hotels and cinemas were told they could open again from 4 July. “Through the lens of survey data, at least for now, the world’s essential economies are seeing a V-shaped and coordinated rebound that looks set to (continue) through the summer in the northern hemisphere,” said Stephen Innes at AxiCorp. “Fingers crossed a second wave super spread does not land in our lap.”However, there are growing concerns of a relapse in some countries that had been opening up, with Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike warning on Wednesday that a number of new cases had been found at one workplace.London stocks retreated on Wednesday as a spike in novel coronavirus cases across the globe compounded fears of a second wave of the pandemic, while builder Crest Nicholson tumbled after issuing a grim forecast for the year. A US public health chief told Congress on Tuesday that coronavirus has “brought this nation to its knees” as America struggles with more than 2.3 million confirmed cases and more than 121,000 deaths so far.Dr Robert Redfield, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told a hearing in Washington that core public health capabilities in the US had been vastly underfunded for a long time and needed urgent investment.Chinese telecom giant Huawei opened its second global flagship store in Shanghai on Wednesday, part of plans to strengthen its brand in its core Chinese consumer market as it faces headwinds overseas.Hundreds of face mask-wearing customers queued up to enter the 5,000-square-metre (54,000-square-foot) store – Huawei’s largest – located on the city’s busiest shopping street and directly across from a retail outlet of rival Apple.Company representatives said Huawei intends to open several more such stores in China in the coming year to showcase its smartphones and other consumer tech, plans that they said were conceived before the US government launched a worldwide campaign against the firm about 18 months ago.Huawei is the world’s largest supplier of telecom network equipment and planet’s number two smartphone maker.Gold prices surged to their highest in nearly eight years on Wednesday, while global shares cooled as signs of an acceleration in coronavirus cases kept investors on edge.

Photograph: Google Street ViewA cafe located behind Dublin’s Four Courts has been operating a sit-in service for almost three weeks ahead of the permitted reopening of cafes and restaurants next week.Fegan’s 1924 Cafe on Chancery Street, 200m from Bridewell Garda station, is allowing customers to use its indoor tables, despite the cafe and restaurant sector being restricted to operating take-away services until June 29th under coronavirus regulations.Cafe owner James Fegan said he was providing a service particularly for barristers who would have “nowhere else to go” if the cafe was not available to them. He said gardaí had also been using the cafe’s toilets when it was not practical for them to return to the Garda station.Mr Fegan said he had operated a take-away service for approximately six weeks but was now in his third week of providing an indoor service, in line with 2m distancing of tables and a strict hygiene and cleaning regime.“About 85 per cent of our business comes out of the Four Courts. We would get a lot of legal eagles in here, people giving advice to clients. They haven’t got the space in the courts and we would be the closest place for them to use a table. The likes of barristers would have nowhere else to go.”Mr Fegan said he was only allowing regular customers to sit in, with those he did not know being restricted to take away only.“During the Gemma O’Doherty and John Waters case there were some protesters who wanted to come in, but we didn’t allow that. I have no problem with protesters but we didn’t know them. But we did have guards in using the toilet at that time.”Mr Fegan said his business differed from a standard cafe or restaurant in that it was part of a cash and carry.“The cash and carry and wholesale business has continued all the way through, so given we were here anyway we thought we might as well keep the cafe business going.”Health and safetyThe cafe is “fully sanitised” at the start of every morning and before and after lunch, while the tables and chairs are cleaned after every sitting, Mr Fegan said. Staff had undergone health and safety training, including training on how to reassure customers who might be nervous to return to cafes.As he had opened ahead of the official date of June 29th, he had been asked to advise other cafes and restaurants ahead of their reopening next week. Mr Fegan said he had not been asked by the Garda or any other authority to stop serving customers indoors.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4286670.1592936402!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools to set up isolation areas for those with covid 19 symptoms","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCleaning crews work to deep clean a primary school in Melbourne, Australia, after some students tested positive for Covid-19 this week.  Photograph: Darrian TraynorGettyAll schools will be required to have designated isolation areas for any staff or pupils with symptoms of Covid-19, according to new official guidance.In addition, all teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) will be required to undergo Covid-19 induction training prior to returning to the classroom.Staff will not be required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) with the exception of circumstances such as providing first aid or dealing with suspected Covid-19 cases.However, masks should be provided to any staff member or pupil who has symptoms of the virus.The guidance is contained in a Department of Education School Covid-19 Response Plan, which is being circulated to schools ahead of the start of a summer catch-up programme for children with special needs.Similar rules are expected to apply to all schools when they reopen to all students in late August and September.The guidance, however, does not state what physical distancing rules will apply when schools reopen.A department spokesman said these details were still being finalised in conjunction with public health officials and were due to be published later this week.Under the latest guidance, any staff or pupils with symptoms of the virus will be asked to leave safely or be transported home by a family member. Public transport of any kind should not be used.In addition, schools will be required to limit access to the building to essential workers only and keep a detailed log of people arriving in and out of school.Handwashing facilities or hand sanitisers must be made available at multiple locations within the school facility and should be available in each classroom.Staff will also be required to use and clean their own equipment and utensils such as cups, cutlery and plates.Minister for Education Joe McHugh has said his preference is for schools to reopen fully with no requirement for physical distancing between pupils on the basis that many would not be able to return to school otherwise.CriticismThe department, meanwhile, has faced criticism for the delay in providing detailed guidance to schools on physical distancing just days ahead of the end of the academic year and the start of the summer catch-up programme.Fórsa, the trade union which represents 12,000 school staff including SNAs, warned that the absence of detailed guidance was deterring many schools and staff from opting in to the summer programme.“Without this guidance schools do not know how many students can attend, what PPE such as masks will be required, and what new hygiene regime will be required,” it said, in a statement.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) said while some practical guidance had been issued to schools this week, it was imperative the department moved quickly to issue expert public health advice to allay any concerns of schools, teachers and parents. It said those signing up to the summer programme must be confident that they can participate in this scheme in a safe manner, with thorough guidance available to school boards of management, principals and teachers who choose to participate.New casesThe guidance comes as three new Covid-19-related deaths were reported in the Republic as well as 10 new confirmed cases.The latest figures reported on Tuesday evening by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) bring total deaths to 1,720 and the total number of cases to 25,391, as of midnight on Monday. It said 18,368 tests for the virus had been carried out in the past week, of which 97 were positive. This indicates a positivity rate of 0.5 per cent.

Photograph: Tim GrahamGetty ImagesAir pollution levels have rebounded sharply in a number of leading European cities since coronavirus restrictions eased, driven by an increase in traffic and congestion.Paris, Brussels and Milan have all experienced significant rises in nitrogen dioxide compared with their lows during the lockdown, according to an analysis based on data from the European Environment Agency (EEA).The data underscores how the environmental benefits of lockdown may have been short-lived, as more commuters shun public transport due to the virus and use their cars instead.“It is definitely a huge challenge that we are seeing pollution volumes at or near pre-Covid-19 levels, even though in many cities traffic volumes are below pre-crisis levels,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, which produced the analysis alongside the Financial Times.“We risk getting pre-crisis levels of congestion and pollution already, before full economic reopening,” he added.Analysis of the EEA data show that nitrogen dioxide pollution in Paris has risen from 13.6 micrograms per cubic metre at its lowest point during the lockdown, to 29.7 µgm3 most recently, based on a weather-adjusted 30-day average.In Brussels, air pollution levels rose from a low of 16 µgm3 to 30.2 while in Milan the levels increased from 19 µgm3 to 32.9. In London, air pollution levels were briefly above pre-lockdown levels when a sunny long weekend in late May prompted a surge in traffic.The air pollution levels in most European cities are still below that of a year ago, according to the analysis. But a rapid uptick in many over so short a time period has stoked concern among clean-air advocates.William Todts, head of the Transport and Environment campaign group, welcomed the fact that the pandemic had accelerated many cities’ plans to encourage cycling and walking.“A big test will be whether they make all those temporary measures permanent,” he said, adding that there was a “short-term risk” of more cars on the road due to fears of using public transport.Traffic congestion has risen markedly in Germany, France and Italy compared with during the lockdown, according to data from TomTom, the satellite navigation device company.Meanwhile the number of people using public transport has plummeted. The London Underground is carrying about 12 per cent of its normal passenger load.Paris initiativesAs well as being among the big risers in the six weeks since its lockdown was lifted, Paris also had the biggest relative decline in nitrogen dioxide levels during lockdown. At one point the city’s nitrogen dioxide levels were 61 per cent below pre-pandemic levels.Anne Hidalgo, the mayor who faces a re-election battle this weekend, has made clean air a key part of her agenda, and has long been an adversary of cars in the capital. She has used Covid-19 as a way to advance her agenda for a greener, less polluted city with more pedestrians and cyclists.“Fighting against all types of pollution is a public health issue,” she told Le Monde newspaper recently. “That is why we will continue to reduce the presence of cars in our city.” Her proposal to lower the speed limit on most city streets from 50kmh to 30kmh is likely to infuriate drivers who have already been irked by her anti-car policies.The air pollution data show that cities which did not go through a hard lockdown – such as Malmo in Sweden – recorded higher levels of vehicle pollution this year compared with last year.Athens, Bucharest, and Munich have also experienced significant rebounds in air pollution. Among the major European cities that did lock down, Budapest is the only one that has already rebounded above normal levels, according to the analysis. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Friends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation PlanFrench president created convention in April 2019 in response to gilets jaunes revoltMinister for Climate Action and Environment says funds would go to just transition"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winter"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

If we are just to wag our fingers at people and say that there is no hope of you turning around to this. I believe the other parties are starting to do that, all that, and I think that is because the Irish people want to do it.”ChangesMr Ryan told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that he believes both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael “are up for making the sort of changes we need to make” and for working as a team to “do that in a way that helps to meet other goals and does help us to get out of the economic crisis”.“I believe that is absolutely possible,” he said.Mr Ryan added that it “is going to create a huge challenge.”The Green Party leader said an annual 7 per cent reduction in carbon emissions – “a 51 per cent cut over the decade” – was “agreed and it is critical and it is important”.A lot of it will take place in the “latter part of the decade” but measures would start immediately during the incoming government to prepare for the cuts. “Within the first 100 days of government, if we are in there, we would introduce legislation that starts to set out five year budgets, so you start measuring and monitoring and introducing the measures you need to do to achieve it and you have real power to do that, because there is political commitment to do it,” he said. A proposed significant increase in carbon tax is a “huge project and will take time”, he said, adding money raised would be returned to those in fuel poverty and farmers.On the broader economic plan, Mr Ryan said the would-be coalition’s strategy “first and foremost” will be to borrow money to stimulate the economy.“I’s a Keynesian response, where you actually put money into the economy,” he said.Economic analysis“What you hope and expect, and the economic analysis is that this is very possible, is you see the economy lift, you see incomes growing, and tax revenue increases in that way because there will still be all those taxes on income and other measures.“If that isn’t enough to close the gap, there are other measures. Included in that is a potential increase in employers and employee PRSI and possibly other tax... there will be an increase in carbon tax and other taxes such as plastics... the primary approach to this is initially in the first two to three years to increase borrowing rather than taxes to stimulate the economy.”Mr Ryan said the approach “makes sense” at a time of low interest rates. If the Greens reject the deal, the party will still have to be part of the “wider political system to come up with some alternative of running the country”, he added.Results of internal ballots on the proposed programme for government will be announced by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party on Friday.The Green Party has widened eligibility for members who can vote by telephone on the programme. It has emailed members saying that registered voters who have not received their ballots can vote by phone.With many votes already cast, the contest is said to be delicately poised between the Yes and No camps.Leading figures on both sides have been involved in campaigns in recent days, making thousands of telephone calls."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4286747.1592952011!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government considers review of offences against the state act","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAccording to sources,   Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan may announce a review of the controversial legislation. Photograph: Colin Keegan, Collins DublinThe Government is understood to be considering a review of the Offences Against the State Act, the legislation that has been used in trials of subversives and gangland crimes for the past five decades.The Act provides for the establishment of the non-jury Special Criminal Court and, because it is emergency legislation, it has to be renewed each year.The renewal date is June 30th but without a functioning Seanad at present, it will mean the legitimacy of the court will expire at the end of the month unless a new government is formed.That has prompted concerns of trials against suspects not being able to proceed because the legislative basis behind the charges no longer exists.Sources said last night that Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan may be minded to announce a review of the legislation which has been controversial.However, it is understood the review will not be a stand-alone review but be part of a comprehensive reevaluation of security legislation recommended by the Commision on the Future of Policing in Ireland.While Mr Flanagan is said not be opposed to the idea of a review, there are no indications that Fine Gael - or, for that matter, Fianna Fáil - would agree to the ending the non-jury status of the court.Until recent years it was primarily used to prosecute so-called scheduled offences including subversive crimes and membership of illegal organisations such as the IRA, the INLA, and the Real IRA.In recent years it has also been used for non-scheduled offences in drugs and gangland cases, where there are concerns over intimidation of, and threats against, juries.The Dáil will debate a motion on the legislation on Wednesday in anticipation of a government being formed. If it is, the incoming government will work to get the legislation through the Dáil at the special sitting on Saturday and through the newly convened Seanad on Monday. That will allow it to be renewed before the Act lapses.Calls to abolishSinn Féin has been calling for the court to be abolished for more than two decades primarily because it was used as a vehicle to prosecute IRA members. Its objections focus nowadays on the fact that it is a non-jury court.Official Green Party policy has also been for the court to be abolished. However, both its leader Eamon Ryan and Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald signalled they would be willing to change their respective parties’ stances on the legislation during the general election campaign in February.That came after the particularly brutal murder of Drogheda teenager Keane Mulready-Woods as part of a wider feud involving drug guns.Sinn Féin now says it accepts special powers are needed to tackle gangland crime but still objects to the non-jury nature of the court. It has consistently voted against the renewal of the powers.In an amendment tabled by its justice spokesman, Martin Kenny, the party says it is willing to accept a court with special powers as its priority is to tackle organised crime.“To do this we need to put in place a law that befits the 21st century. Criminal gangs operate on a global scale and some operate entirely online,” said Mr Kenny.He said new legislation should be enacted to put the court on a permanent basis. It was ridiculous that emergency powers intended as a temporary measure were still being used almost 48 years after their enactment, he said.Remote juriesHowever, he said the party did not accept that a non-jury court was the way to proceed. He argued that the advent of technology would allow remote juries, whose anonymity could be protected. This could help prevent jury tampering and intimidation, which occurred in some gangland and drug cases which were heard before juries in the ordinary criminal courts.The Greens have also called for a review of the courts.Neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael have raised any objection to the non-jury nature of the court.However, if Mr Flanagan does agree to an independent review – while leaving the emergency powers in place for another year – there is a possibility that Sinn Féin might not oppose the renewal for the first time since its TDs entered Dáil Éireann in 1997."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Officials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeLatest in a series of threats from the Kim regime since diplomacy with US broke downFierce criticism as editor of influential Rappler website faces up to six years in jailChile replaces health minister as deaths spiral while global cases exceed 7.6 millionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"World community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287137.1592977840!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu asks united states to reconsider covid 19 travel ban","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Donald Trump speaks with Rodney Scott, the US Border Patrol Chief, as he tours a section of the border wall on Tuesday in Arizona. Photograph: APThe European Union has stepped up efforts to persuade the United States to exempt EU citizens legally residing in the US from the travel ban, as both sides consider the next stage in opening-up borders for international travel in the wake of coronavirus.In a letter to US secretary of state Mike Pompeo last week, EU ambassador Stavros Lambrinidis and Croatia’s ambassador to the US, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, asked the US to reconsider the scope of the current travel ban imposed by the US in March to take account of Europeans living in the US on non-immigrant visas.Thousands of Europeans are employed under various categories of so-called “non-immigrant” visas in the US, but under the terms of the travel ban which applies to most European countries, China and Iran, they are unable to re-enter the United States if they visit those countries.The European Commission already offers more flexibility to non-EU nationals, and has recommended that third-country nationals, including Americans, legally residing in the EU should be exempt from travel restrictions.Ban on visasOn Monday, US president Donald Trump announced a ban on issuing new non-immigrant visas to foreign workers for the rest of the year, though those who are already living and working in the United States on visas are not affected. However, the presidential order means that thousands of people who had expected to travel to the United States for work later in 2020 will be unable to do so.Discussions between inidual embassies and the EU mission in Washington are taking place with the administration and the State Department on possible exemptions to the travel restrictions or a standardised approach by the two blocs. Other categories of foreign residents in the United States are permitted to re-enter, though they must abide by quarantine and other health requirements in each state on their return. In the letter, the ambassadors point out that current US coronavirus travel rules mean that EU citizens resident in the United States are banned from entering the US if travelling from the Schengen area or Ireland.The diplomatic push comes amid reports that the EU could ban US travellers from entering the Schengen area as it considers taking a coordinated approach among member states to reopening the bloc’s external borders from July 1st.The US has reported more than 2.3 million cases – the highest in the world – with top immunologist Anthony Fauci warning on Tuesday of a “disturbing surge” in infection rates in some US states.One possibility is that both blocs could maintain restrictions on tourist visitors, but have different arrangements for those ordinarily resident in either the EU or the US.Less than five months before the presidential election, immigration is returning to the political agenda in the United States.Border wallMr Trump toured a section of the border wall in Arizona yesterday, as he made a trip to the electorally-important state.Stating that illegal immigration was down 84 per cent compared to a year ago – a figure that has been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic – Mr Trump said that no administration had done more to secure America’s southern border.“Our border has never been more secure,” he said, accusing presidential rival Joe Biden and Democrats of wanting “open borders” and “criminal sanctuaries”.Mr Trump inspected a section of a 320km segment of the steel wall, signing a plaque attached to the barrier. Earlier, he described the structure as “just about unclimbable”, and “the most powerful” barrier in the world.Mr Trump’s visit to Arizona came a day after he signed a presidential order expanding immigration restrictions, by halting the issuance of new visas for certain categories of foreign workers until the end of the year. He also extended a ban on green card applications until at least next year. Speaking at the border wall on Tuesday, Mr Trump defended the move, stating: “we want to give jobs to Americans right now”. But he hinted that some breakthrough on DACA – the programme that protects young Americans who arrived in the country illegally as children – could be imminent.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

At the time, there had been 350 deaths from Covid-19 in the UK. Today there have been close to 40,000. That grim figure explains why the Government has retained the controls over social interactions, albeit with modifications as the pace of contagion has slowed.Now that it has almost halted, Mr Johnson is emboldened to relax the restrictions further and, in delivering better news, he certainly looked far more chipper in the Commons than he has done for a while, back to the old Boris.But listening to his statement about what we are now permitted to do was to appreciate in the starkest terms what it is that we have lost. For a country that is defined by its love of freedom to be told that we can go to the pub, though only if we supply our names and addresses to the innkeeper or can get our hair cut, though only if our coiffeur dresses like a nuclear power plant worker or we can have a dinner party but must not embrace or kiss our guests, these are hard orders to take, even if they are dressed up as “guidance”. As a law-abiding nation, we take these things seriously even when they are not actually the law of the land as many of these “rules” are not, including the two-metre distancing.Many restrictions seem arbitrary. Why, for instance, is professional football allowed but not cricket? This makes no sense since the former involves much more close contact. Mr Johnson said the ball in cricket acted as a vector for disease but on that basis the game will never restart.We were promised Independence Day on July 4 but remain in chains, even if they are looser than before. Even when we are freed, which will not happen this year because of the Government’s fear of a second wave, much will have changed.Looking through my wallet yesterday was like a Proustian journey into a past life. Photo-passes to offices \u2028I no longer visit an oyster card for trains that I no longer use a library card for books no longer borrowed and even some cash – remember that? These may well be the detritus of a world never to be regained. Will those of us able to work at home ever be allowed back into the office or even want to go for that matter?I had thought that once this nightmare was over, we would all be commuting into cities again, eager to return to the camaraderie and woke minefield of modern office life, but I have my doubts now.Parents whose children have been at home since March and face another two months with the little darlings cannot wait to get back to the office but once the schools have returned they might think differently. Home working by millions will be an abiding legacy of this time with all the implications that will have for the viability of public transport, commercial property management and businesses like cafes, restaurants and taxis that rely on commuters for their livelihoods, especially in London.Foreign travel will change even when the 14-day quarantine for all arrivals is dropped. While there are many people desperate to get back to the beaches of the Med, there are others who find the thought of a masked four-hour queue at the airport intolerable. Eating out, going to the cinema, attending the theatre – all these activities are to reopen but their pleasures constrained by pettifogging rules and for how long?What else will change? The BBC has been running a series of podcasts called Rethink in which leading figures in their fields consider what might happen. One contributor, Lady Hale, the former president of the Supreme Court, suggests that we might reconsider how we use juries in criminal trials.This has been a theme recently among jurists alarmed at the growing backlog in the system. One proposed “temporary measure” is for judges to sit alone or with a couple of lay assessors rather than with a full jury in order to get through the mountain of pending trials. But it would not be a temporary measure. Once introduced it would be hard to get rid of it. Do we want the “new normal” to erode our ancient juridical rights?Or what about Parliament: when will it go back to proper functioning? Now that voting is carried out remotely or by proxy, do we ever see the old system returning or a full complement of MPs allowed back to Westminster? What will that mean for the scrutiny of legislation which was never especially well done and has been almost non-existent in recent weeks?Research by the Hansard Society think tank found that more than \u202890 pieces of legislation, including significant restrictions on people’s freedoms, were pushed through without parliamentary scrutiny. We have lost a great deal in the past few months. We cannot dispense with our democracy as well.Do events like a pandemic create a new reality or accentuate changes that were already lurking beneath the surface? Notwithstanding the death toll, this has not been the catastrophic plague that some had feared and has mercifully spared the young almost entirely, unlike past contagions. Moreover, when Mr Johnson announced what he acknowledged to be an unprecedented curtailment of inidual freedom, he said the aim was to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed.That justification passed some time ago and yet the Government still thinks it should dictate how we conduct our lives, including our most intimate contacts. Provided the people most likely to succumb to the virus are protected then everyone else should be allowed to carry on and assess the risk (low for most) to themselves.Our freedoms cannot continue to be restricted by a fixation on R numbers or assumptions that there will be a “second wave” of the virus which, as Liam Fox said in the Commons, is merely the continuation of a disease that we cannot get rid of and have to live with. The “new normal” is a world devoid of light and liberty.

In suburbs of Lisbon, too, a partial lockdown is being reimposed after a rise in local cases. Globally, according to the World Health Organisation, the pandemic is accelerating.Look more calmly, though, and one thing becomes apparent. While the number of recorded cases globally has yet to peak the number of deaths peaked in April and is now running about half the level it was then. While more and more people are being recorded as suffering from Covid-19, fewer are dying. Why?It is partly because the world is performing ever more Covid tests. The more you test, the more Covid-19 you will find. Tests are now picking up asymptomatic cases which would previously have gone undetected. The number of cases recorded is no guide to the true level of incidence of infections. Look at Britain, where officially  there have been 305,000 recorded cases of the disease. Yet the ONS, on the strength of antibody tests, has estimated that 6.78 percent of the population (4.4 million Britons) have been infected. In spite of Matt Hancock’s boast of reaching his target of 100,000 tests a day, we have managed to capture fewer than one in 10 cases of the disease.But there is something else apparent from the data on Covid-19. The wider the infection spreads, the more it is concentrated in younger, less vulnerable age groups. In Portugal, a rise in cases has been blamed on young people partying. However much and irresponsibly they party, however, they have failed to make any impact on the daily death toll, which is in low single figures compared with over 30 back in April.It is a very different situation from March and April when Covid-19 was running riot in care homes all across Europe and North America. In the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control, more than a quarter of tests among the over-65s in March turned out to be positive. That has now fallen to less than five per cent. More cases, by contrast, are now being picked up among children and teenagers – but that doesn’t matter so much because they have a very tiny chance of dying from the disease or suffering any ill effects.If all age groups had the same chance of dying from Covid 19 as do children (who are more likely to die from being struck by lightning), there would be no need to do anything about the disease – it could safely be allowed to rip through the population unchecked. All of which begs the question: why don’t we allow young people to build up society’s herd immunity while simultaneously protecting the elderly and other vulnerable people? This was, in fact, once a policy that was favoured by at least one government scientific adviser.On March 12, Graham Medley, Professor of Infectious Disease Modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and a member of Sage, told Newsnight: “If I could, what I would like to do is put all the more vulnerable people into the North of Scotland and keep them there, everyone else in Kent and have a nice big epidemic in Kent so everyone becomes immune, and then we can put people back together again.”Instead, we seemed to do pretty much the opposite: we locked young people away indoors while discharging elderly hospital patients, untested, into care homes where they helped spread the virus unchecked. Eventually, however, we have – accidentally – arrived at more or less is the policy Medley advocated.Young people, fed up with lockdown, are increasingly flouting the rules by partying, going on protests and the like, while many elderly people remain indoors. Black Lives Matter hasn’t done a lot for community relations, stirring up tensions. But it may just have done us a favour by contributing to herd immunity from Covid-19.In Britain, new infections from Covid-19 have fallen to a trickle in any case. In the first half of June, according to the ONS, only around one in 1700 people had the virus at any one time. But if we do get a second spike in infections, it would be madness the repeat the economically-debilitating experiment of total lockdown. We should protect the vulnerable – and let others continue more or less normal life.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mail postmen should not sacked caught urinating public","story":"Royal Mail postmen should not be sacked if they are caught urinating during rounds, a tribunal has suggested, after one worker was dismissed for relieving himself in a lay-by.Roo Rawal was fired for gross misconduct in 2017 after he was filmed allegedly urinating in a very busy street near his depot in Watford, Herts. Mr Rawal had worked for the Royal Mail for 17 years.Challenging his dismissal at an employment tribunal, postal workers described how public urination had become routine among men and women, adding they were sometimes left with no option.The hearing was told that at least 12 of Mr Rawal\u0027s colleagues had kept their jobs after they were caught relieving themselves, including one postman who urinated next to a front door.Veteran postman Adam Hicks told the hearing such incidents happen all the time because of the nature and circumstances of the role, adding some workers have no option but to urinate while on duty.Mr Rawal was fired following a complaint in September 2017 which included footage of him allegedly urinating in a lay-by.It was really upsetting seeing someone doing that on the street, especially someone from a big, famous and professional company as Royal Mail, the complaint read.That\u0027s a very busy street where even children can see him. We can confirm we are still distressed by this disturbing behaviour and we really hope you will do something about it.The tribunal concluded Mr Rawal was unfairly dismissed, adding the issue surrounding public urination was not an uncommon matter.The panel said there was no evidence any workers caught urinating had been formally disciplined, and suggested Royal Mail must rank the offence at the less serious end of the misconduct scale.A separate claim for racial discrimination was dismissed.

Only one in 1,700 people have the virus, compared with an average of one in 400 a month ago.Where it is not possible to stay two metres apart, people are advised instead to keep one metre plus apart – meaning one metre apart plus mitigation.But I must say to the House it will be all too easy for that frost to return. And that is why we will continue to trust in the common sense and the community spirit of the British people to follow this guidance, to carry us through, and to see us to victory over this virus.From July 4, any two households can meet together under the same roof, and even stay overnight, as long as they observe social distancing. That means families could invite one set of grandparents over for lunch and then see the other set of grandparents for dinner, as long as they are not there at the same time.The new rule also allows any two households to meet up in a pub, restaurant, museum or cinema, or even go on holiday together. There will be no limit on how many people can gather, as long as no more than two households are meeting at the same time.The Government decided against an alternative plan to allow two entire households to form one social bubble, partly because it would have forced families to choose which set of relations they could see.Existing rules allowing up to six people from up to six different households to meet outdoors remain in place, as does the rule that allows someone living alone to join a support bubble (see below) with another household and be treated as if they live in the same home.Downing Street admitted people would need to show a lot of discipline and restraint to adhere to the new rules, such as preventing children from hugging grandparents, but stressed that the changes would be swiftly reversed if coronavirus started to spread again.A Number 10 spokesman said: Your household will be able to link with one other household at a time, which includes staying over at someone\u0027s house.This is not a bubble because households should continue to remain socially distant from one another when they are indoors or outdoors, so they will need to stay two metres apart or follow the new one-metre plus advice.This will allow customers to sit closer together in venues in which it is not possible for them to be two metres apart, so long as there are additional mitigating measures in place. New safety guidance, due to be issued later, will set out a menu of options for hospitality bosses to use as part of the new system. These include more back-to-back seating, perspex screens, partitions between tables, disposable menus and more cleaning of commonly touched surface areas. Waiters will be required to wipe down surfaces more often and collect glasses and plates more frequently. People will be discouraged from returning their glass or ordering from the bar, with more table service and mobile apps expected to be introduced. The changes will also place limits on the number of people who can sit together indoors in pubs and restaurants, with just two households of any size permitted to drink or eat together. To assist the Test and Trace system, customers will be required to register their details with a venue before entry.Hairdressing salons will be able to reopen, but the experience of getting your hair cut is likely to be very different.Hairdressers will be required to wear a full-face plastic visor to reduce the risk of infection and will also need to follow strict rules over the disinfecting of equipment.Customers will have to make appointments, and there will be limits on the amount of people in salons. It is also anticipated that hairstylists will be told to cut down on small talk.But the mass reopening will come with a number of conditions attached. Recommendations to stop coronavirus from spreading include emptying mini bars, offering buffet-free breakfasts and regularly deep cleaning rooms, with 24 hours left between bookings.All paperwork is likely to be removed from rooms, along with the telephone, while the plastic pouch containing tea and coffee sachets will either be removed or quarantined for up to 72 hours between guests.Those checking in should expect to see social distancing stickers on the floor, perspex screens at the reception desk and hand sanitiser available throughout. It is thought campsites will be instructed to ensure that tents are pitched further apart than normal so social distancing measures can be adhered to, along with frequent deep cleaning of facility blocks such as showers. Some campsites will be required to reduce the number of pitches to keep numbers down. Campers are likely be told they cannot have day visitors in order to further limit the numbers on site. Communal areas such as receptions, shops, laundries and playgrounds are likely to remain closed, with guests advised to bring all their own essentials, including gas canisters.As with hotels and other overnight accommodation, guests will be asked to pay in advance and use contactless payment rather than cash. Changes to the rules, allowing two households to meet up, mean that two families will now be able to go on holiday together.The Prime Minister confirmed: From July 4, provided that no more than two households stay together, people will be free to stay overnight in self-contained accommodation, including hotels and bed and breakfasts.Mr Johnson did not specifically mention Britain\u0027s 2.2 million shielded people in his statement.However on Monday, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, announced that this extremely clinically vulnerable group would finally be able to meet friends and visit relatives\u0027 homes from July 6.Shielded people, considered to be the most medically vulnerable to the effects of coronavirus, including those with lung conditions and people being treated for cancer, will be able to meet up to five other people outdoors after having been virtual prisoners in their own homes for the past three months.If they live alone they will also be able to form a support bubble with one other household, meaning they can visit their families and stay overnight with them. It is hoped the infection rate will be low enough for shielding to end all together at the end of July, though help will still be available from NHS volunteers and local councils.As long as they continue strict social distancing measures, shielded people will be able to visit supermarkets and places of worship, and those who cannot work from home will be able to return as long as their workplace adheres to Government guidance.Until now, the only easing of lockdown for shielded people has been allowing them to go outside once a day with their household or, if they live alone, to meet one other person at a two-metre distance.It advises that shielded children can return to school in line with their peers, provided they wash their hands frequently and adhere to social distancing. Mr Johnson said that Easter, Passover and Eid all occurred during the lockdown and he was pleased to announce that places of worship will reopen for prayer and services, including weddings with a maximum of 30 people, all subject to social distancing.Weddings will restart from July 4, with up to 30 people able to attend under social distancing rules. Lockdown is easing - but here\u0027s are the things you still can\u0027t doSwimming pools and water parksBowling alleys and indoor skating rinks Nail bars and beauty salons  Indoor fitness and dance studios, and indoor gyms and sports venuesfacilities Exhibition or conference centres From July 4, provided they are Covid-19 compliant:Restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs             Cinemas and bingo halls       Theatres and concert hallsMuseums and galleries            Outdoor playgrounds, gyms, and skating rinks         Funfairs, theme parks and adventure parks and amusement arcades       Aquariums, zoos, safari parks, farms, wildlife centres and any place where animals are exhibited as an attractionMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/23/10/dizzee-rascal-piers-morgan-gmb-2.jpg","title":"dizzee rascal piers morgan gmb interview susanna reid good morning britain blm","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Artist\u0026nbsppraised for making the TV host ‘squirm’ on live televisionThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism.

Am I the black spokesperson?”He then told Morgan that, while he has “a bunch of views” to share, he felt that “now is not the time” to speak about them.Meet Che Lingo, the London rapper confronting police brutalityHow the art world can step up for Black Lives Matter“I’ve brought my afro out, I’m looking a bit natural and so maybe that’s why you’re asking the question, but not today,” he said.

You’re a high-profile black man in this country, and it’s been a huge issue and has been a huge news story for four weeks.”Dizzee, attempting to get a word in, replied: “You know what, I watch you on telly and you never let no one speak.

The BMA believes face masks or coverings should be worn by the public now as a matter of course, in order to keep the risk of infection as low as possible.Where to buy face coverings for kids as lockdown easesFace mask buying guide: Everything you need to know as lockdown easesHow to wear a face mask safely”It is already mandatory to wear coverings on public transport, and we believe the Westminster government should now require the public to wear face coverings and ensure people have access to enough proper masks or coverings, as has been done in other countries.“Face coverings have been mandatory on public transport in England since 15 June, with passengers who fail to wear one at risk of fines. Announcing the new social distancing rule on Tuesday, Mr Johnson stressed it was “preferable” for people to remain two metres apart but said “we can now move to one metre plus where it is not possible for us to stay two metres apart”.He added: “That means staying one metre apart plus mitigations which reduce the risk of transmission and these precautions could include installing screens, making sure people face away from each other, providing hand-washing facilities, minimising the amount of time you spend with people outside of your household and of course being outdoors.“On public transport, it already means one metre plus, it means wearing a face covering for mitigation as everybody I think now understands.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

With this work, we now believe that isn’t true”.Mercury can become concentrated in marine organisms as small amounts are ingested by some species which in turn are eaten by larger species, resulting in more harmful concentrations of the liquid metal accumulating in animals higher up the food chain.Half of world’s population exposed to increasing air pollutionNearly 2m people with lung conditions note improvement in lockdownCar tyres polluting huge swathes of seas and rivers, say scientistsHighest levels of mercury ever found in blubber of dolphins in ChannelIt is generally poisonous at high levels to humans and other animals and can be especially dangerous to the developing foetus.Dr Sun\u0027s team used a deep-sea vehicle to capture animals from between 7,000-11,000m and take sediment samples at 5,500-9,200m.“We are able to present unequivocal mercury isotope evidence that the mercury in the trench fauna originates exclusively from methylmercury from the upper ocean,” Dr Suns said. ”We can tell this because of the distinctive isotopic fingerprint which stamps it as coming from the upper ocean.”A second research team, led by Dr Joel Blum from the University of Michigan, sampled fish and crustaceans from two of the deepest Pacific Trenches – the Kermadec trench near New Zealand and the Mariana Trench of the Philippines.They discovered that mercury found in trench species in both locations was largely derived from the atmosphere and had entered the ocean through rainfall.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some of this mercury is naturally-produced, but it is likely that much of it comes from human activity.“This work shows that human-released mercury has reached and entered foodwebs in even the most remote marine ecosystems on earth. This better understanding of the origin of mercury in the deepest reaches of the ocean will aid in modeling the fate of mercury in the atmosphere and oceans”.Professor Ken Rubin, an independent researcher at the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Hawaii, said: ”We know that mercury is introduced into the environment from a variety of natural sources such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires.“However, human activities, such as coal and petroleum burning, mining, and manufacturing are mainly responsible for mercury deposition to marine environments. We are now learning from these two studies that the effects of this deposition have spread throughout the ocean into the deep sea and the animals that live there, which is yet another indicator of the profound impact of modern human activities on the planet.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They\u0027re not domestic animals that need a lot of help from us. They just need us not to kill them or destroy their habitat.”The research team found people who identified as liberal were more likely than those who identified as conservatives to show positive changes in favour of wolves in measures of attitudes, acceptance and intended behaviors regardless of the videos they watched.The largest changes in tolerance were linked to older age. People above the age of 40, regardless of political background, were more likely to have larger changes in their attitudes for or against wolves.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The team said though wolves are essential for maintaining a ersity of species in a landscape and improving the health of populations they prey on, they can also compete with people for space and resources, and can pose a risk for livestock.They said one unanswered question in their work is about how effective the videos were at reaching people who may not already agree with the underlying message.“People are already asking the question: how do we get the media to cross ideological bubbles that people have created?” Professor Peterson said.The paper, “How do YouTube videos impact tolerance of wolves?” is published in the journal Human Dimensions of Wildlife.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Coleen feels that the time and money involved could be put to better use her offer to meet face to face still stands. Mrs Vardy’s decision to issue court proceedings does at least mean that Coleen’s evidence can be made public when the time is right.”  The combined legal fees are set to cost up to £1m, The Sun, which found itself at the centre of the original dispute between the celebrities, reported.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Lifting lockdown measures now in England risks a second wave of coronavirus during the winter, a former chief scientific adviser to the government has warned.“I think it’s extraordinarily risky,” Sir David King told Sky News.“If we take the long view we know that the winter is a likely period when the virus takes off again. We must therefore aim to completely get rid of the virus from this country before the winter.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHis warning came a day after Boris Johnson announced the most significant relaxation of the Covid-19 lockdown so far, telling the public that pubs, cinemas, hairdressers and restaurants will reopen on 4 July, and that the two-metre rule will be eased.Unveiling the easing of restrictions that were imposed in March, the prime minister said “our long national hibernation” was coming to an end, but his chief scientific adviser made clear at the No 10 coronavirus press conference the package of measures was “not risk free”.“If we move too quickly, which is what I think is being proposed here, the risk of running into a second wave becomes very significant,” Sir David said on Wednesday.“We have done such a good job in this country, we the public, in staying at home, if we could only be a little more patient. I don’t think there’s anyone who can believe from the scientific point of view that this a wise move.“We really need to get the number of infections down, and we must have a find, test, trace, isolate and support system.Pressed on the economic impact of maintaining the lockdown, he continued: “In terms of the development of this epidemic, we went into lockdown much later than every other country, except one or two where the virus is taking off very crudely right now.“The reason its taking us longer to come out of lockdown is simply because we had a much greater infectivity rate in the population. If we follow Germany and Spain and Italy in coming out of lockdown too quickly because we see them coming out of lockdown, we risk severely seeing another wave.”Boris Johnson confirms pubs to reopen 4 July and 2-metre rule relaxedSir David was speaking as health leaders called for an urgent review to ensure the UK is prepared for the “real risk” of a second wave.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’m not apologising for that at all.‘Grave risk’ of Windrush-style scandal again unless Home Office actsWatchdog to review hostile environment policy in light of Windrush “It is right that we treat each inidual with the respect and dignity they deserve. These are complicated cases.”The home secretary also announced that her department would accept the recommendations of the review into the Windrush scandal – published in March – in full.“The review itself is damning of the conduct of the Home Office and unequivocal about the ignorance and institutional thoughtlessness towards the race and the history of the Windrush generation by the department,” she said.“There are serious and significant lessons for the Home Office to learn.”During the sitting, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee Yvette Cooper raised the cases of two men who were told in January that their cases were nearly finalised, but had made no progress since.One of these iniduals was Anthony Williams, who served in the armed forces for 13 years, and the other Andrew Bynoe, who was made homeless due to issues with his immigration status.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe GNA, backed militarily by Turkey, called Mr Sisi’s threat a “declaration of war,” and refused to halt its offensive. “We reject this, condemn it and consider it an act of aggression, a blatant intervention, which amounts to a declaration of war,” the GNA said in a letter on Sunday.The Arab League is scheduled to discuss the confrontation in Libya during an emergency session on Tuesday, but Tripoli is boycotting.  Libyan civilians are trapped in the crossfire of Haftar’s proxy warLibya’s general Haftar swindled out of millions by western mercenariesLibya has a chance at peace but Russia and the US are in the wayDanger of ‘miscalculation’ as powers scramble for position in LibyaFears of revenge attacks as Haftar’s forces flee Libya stronghold“We urge parties to commit to a ceasefire and resume negotiations immediately,” the US Embassy declared in a tweet, but efforts at diplomacy appeared to be failing. Turkey and its allies appear confident of a win and in no mood for a deal, and Mr Haftar and his supporters abroad, humiliated after weeks of battlefield losses, are reluctant to give any concessions from a position of weakness. “The Turks had a point,” said one western diplomat involved in Libya affairs. “They had to establish deterrence. Now they are acknowledging that they want to take control of the whole territory. They are saying Haftar has to go.”Libya’s civil war has been deadly, disruptive and gruesome. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced and hundreds killed. Last week came the discovery of mass graves filled with scores of bodies in the city of Tarhouna, where a militia loyal to Mr Haftar was pushed out last month by GNA forces.“Civilians in Libya continue to suffer disproportionately,” Stephanie Williams, the acting UN envoy to Libya, said last week in a presentation. “One million people are now in need of some form of humanitarian assistance.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSirte, a city of some 50,000 people, is significant as the last major urban cluster before a set of crucial Libyan oil facilities and depots located on Libya’s eastern Mediterranean shore and controlled for now by forces loyal to Mr Haftar. It is home to a local population filled with supporters of Gaddafi who are allied with Mr Haftar and remain intensely hostile to the Islamist-tinged government in Tripoli.  It was controlled by militias loyal to the GNA until earlier this year, and both Ankara and the Tripoli government have said they would halt their offensive and be open to peace talks once it and Jufrah are under their control.Egypt boasts significant air and ground forces which could boost Mr Haftar in the battlefield and challenge any forces Turkey and the GNA could muster. But Marsa Matrouh, the last city at the Egyptian border where its troops are garrisoned, is some 15 hours away from Sirte. Meanwhile, Turks and allied GNA militias have a strong presence in Misurata, which lies less than three hours from Sirte, and Ankara has been flooding western Libya with military material and personnel for months. “Egypt’s political will to enter a physical contest with the Turkish-backed GNA coalition is not big,” said Jalel Harchaoui, a North Africa specialist at the Clingendael Institute in the Netherlands. “Turkey and the GNA forces are ready to move forcefully into both Sirte and Jufrah any day now.”Mr Sisi has appeared disappointed in Mr Haftar’s failures but is also under pressure from financial backers in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, who are hostile to the GNA’s inclusion of populist Islamist factions and see Turkey as a strategic threat. Egypt also views events in Libya with grave concern, worried troubles could spill over into its borders.“I believe the assertive language is serious and could lead to some form of action or military deployment even if largely symbolic,” said one Egyptian military analyst. “It appears Egypt’s intent is to force ceasefire negotiations by acting as counterbalance to Turkish and GNA strength on the ground.”The conflict in Libya has drawn in various international powers and their local backers. On the one side is Mr Haftar, the eastern commander and former CIA asset who is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Russia and France. On the other side is the GNA in Tripoli, which in addition to Ankara has begun to receive the implicit blessing of Italy, Germany and the UK.Backed by UAE air power and Russian and Sudanese mercenaries, Mr Haftar launched an ill-fated offensive to take control of Tripoli last year. All of his gains were wiped out in a few extraordinary weeks after Turkey forcefully intervened, dispatching drones, anti-aircraft machinery, military personnel, and Syrian mercenaries to back the GNA forces. After initially supporting Mr Haftar, the White House under President Donald Trump appears to have settled into indifference. On Monday, GNA Prime Minister Fayez Serraj and high-profile interior minister Fathi Bashagha reportedly received a delegation of US military commanders from Africom, the US military force in Africa, amid concern about the deployment of Russian fighter jets in Jufrah. “I  don’t think the Trump administration is willing to be associated with someone who’s losing and also a war criminal,” Mohammed Ali Abdallah, a GNA envoy to the US, said in an interview.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They do what they are told to by top brass but these horribly mixed messages are not a good look.It was once commonplace to hear that this country has the best police force in the world. When was the last time you heard that But it was true. Think of the late PC Keith Palmer, who died in  while heroically preventing a kne-wielding Islamist terrorist from entering the Palace of ­Westminster.Yet during this lockdown, there has been a steady draining away of respect for the police.How we all chortled to learn that in Hampshire,  per cent of police are now overweight or obese — the fat-buttocked blue line.While in London, when a ­protester leapt in front of the PM’s car causing a minor crash, it was hardly a complete surprise to see day-dreaming officers gormlessly staring off into space, as oblivious as Keystone Cops in a coma.There is a growing lack of respect for the police and that is the reason why  officers were injured in one weekend.The ordinary copper has been poorly led, leading to inevitable inaction the moment they are met by protesters or a crowd of eager shoppers at Nike Town.Their own senior officers seem far more concerned about ­displaying their politically correct credentials rather than anything resembling law and order. More than  years ago, the Macpherson Report into the death of Stephen Lawrence in South East London found the Met Police to be ­“institutionally racist”.There has been a great overhaul in the force since.It is hugely welcome that there are Black Asian and Minority ­Ethnicofficers now in senior Scotland Yard roles. This was long overdue.But there is still a long way to go before the force can be regarded as being truly erse.Five of the nation’s police forces have only one black officer.Forces in Durham, North ­Yorkshire, Warwickshire, Dyfed-Powys and North Wales had only one black officer in their ranks each as of March last year.This doesn’t mean our officers should be drawn into events like the death of George Floyd , miles away.It should be self-evident that British police were not in any way responsible for that death in Minneapolis.And yet a statement issued on behalf of Britain’s Chief Constables solemnly stated: “We stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and ­horried by the way George Floyd lost his le.“Justice and accountability should follow. We will tackle bias, racism or discrimination wherever we find it.”But the appalling racist violence of American cops — or indeed, when the police go on a violent rampage in Paris or Hong Kong — should not be clumsily confused with the issues our bobbies face here.As the violent clashes of the past few weeks have demonstrated, our officers should be focused on our own problems dealing with crime on our own streets.PAMELA ANDERSON ­promotes fake leather vegan handbags.You would never guess it’s mostly plastic.The bag, I mean. Not Pam.“Is Dad a James Bond fan by any chance ” cooed Britt on the website Cameo. “I’m here to fulfil your wildest desires.”Wow – you’ve got one old dad going now, Britt!You couldn’t get me a signed photo of Ana de Armas, could you AND they’re off!” cried Lizzie Cundy. No, not her clothes – the horses.“Doing this year’s Ascot at home,” sighs Lizzie.Just as well. They would never have let her into the Royal Enclosure carrying that glass of champagne.SIR KEIR STARMER, Labour’s gutless leader, is scared ­witless of upsetting his union paymasters so he can’t bring himself to admit that opening our schools is safe – despite sending his own children to school throughout the lockdown.Same old Labour – always hypocrites when it comes to educating their children. One law for them etc.Meanwhile, the Government is finally showing some urgency about getting the schools open again for all, pumping £billion into state schools over the next year, including £million for the most disadvantaged children.It beggars belief that non-essential shops have reopened while schools remain closed or see only a trickle of pupils.There are no non-essential children.DOMINIC RAAB says he would only take the knee for his missus and the Queen.Cue widespread and totally predictable outrage from the likes of Labour’s permanently apoplectic David Lammy.But as Raab’s Jewish father Peter fled the Nazis as a six-year-old Czech in , I don’t think the Foreign Secretary needs lessons in opposing racism from anyone.And to many of us, “taking the knee” looks like a servile and empty gesture, bowing down before the great gods of woke.During World War Two, there were those who thought Dame Veras songs were too sentimental for fighting men who might never see home again.But with We’ll Meet Again and The White Clfs Of Dover, Vera gave hope in the darkness all around.It is signicant that the Queen chose that immortal phase “We will meet again” in her address to the nation at the height of the pandemic.Some songs last for ever.DAN WALKER, the BBC presenter, mocks a supporter of the online campaign Defund The BBC as “a Russian bot” – meaning a fake account run by foreign communists who seek our demise.Oh, Dan! Defund The BBC was started by a smart young Glasgow University student called James Yucel.And there are millions who believe that the funding model of the BBC is laughably old-fashioned in the age of Netflix, Amazon and the rest.Sometimes I think it is the BBC’s preachy, ridiculously overpaid presenters such as Gary Lineker, Emily Maitlis and deluded Dan Walker, above, who are the Russian bots – planted to hasten the end of the BBC.Great, but Lewis is paid £million a year by the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One team – and , forced labourers once toiled in Mercedesfactories in Nazi Germany.I drive a BMW, who also used slaves under the Nazis.When it comes to symbols of racism, Lewis, German carmakers take some beating.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After the toughest restrictions in peacetime history, we are now able to make le easier for people to see more of their friends and families and help businesses get back on their feet and get back to work. But the virus has not gone away, there will be flare upsToday we can say our long national hibernation is beginning to come to our end and le is ing to our streets and our shops.The bustle is starting to come back and a new but cautious optimism is palpable.Pubs, restaurants,and cinemas are all able to reopen in England. People will be able to spend time - including going to a restaurant - with one other household at a time. The PM has slashed the  metre rule, telling people to stay  metre away as long as they take other precautions including face coverings. The Prime Minister said all of the four nations of the UK were moving in the same direction - eventhey were doing it at dferent times. He said: The administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland hold responsibility for their own lockdown restrictions    and they will respond to the united view of the Chief Medical Officers at their own pace, based on their own judgment.  But all parts of the UK are now travelling in the same direction and we will continue to work together to ensure that everyone in our country gets the support they need.In a major update today, Boris announced:But Nicola Sturgeon has repeatedly stressed the need to take a slow approach to easing the lockdown. In Scotland, people are allowed to meet up in groups of eight people outdoors and in private gardens. But those groups shouldnt consist of more than two households.Ms Sturgeon announced last week they would be allowed to go inside one anothers homes to use the toilet - weeks after the PM said people in England could do the same thing. She has also said people who are in single-adult households can form a support bubble with another household. But outside of those support bubbles, people cannot go into one anothers homes. She has also said she could push the date pubs are allowed to open because of fears they could be virus hotspots. Non-essential retail in Scotland will be allowed to reopen at the end of this week, after those in England started welcome people back in on June . All Scots have been told to stay local to their area, but the First Minister said she hopes to reopen tourism by July . One of Ms Sturgeons top scientic advisers has suggested the current  metre rule could be changed in Scotland.National Clinical Director Jason Leitch told BBC this morning: “I don’t think we are going to be physically distanced forever. We are going to learn to live with this infectious disease, like we live with tuberculosis and flu. I think physical distancing will change. I am just not entirely sure when.”In Wales, people also have to follow stricter rules than across the border in England.People can meet outside - but not with more than one household. The Welsh Government has also put in guidance telling people to stay local - but new rules allow them to travel outside the five-mile radius of their home to check up on relativeson compassionate grounds. That can include visiting loved ones in care homesthe homes give permission. Schools in Wales have been told to prepare to reopen to pupils from all years from  June. People have to maintain a  metre social distancing rule with people outside their household at all times in Wales. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said that stay-local rules will stay in place until at least July . He said: I really understand thatyou are just the other side of a border, you will feel that this is rough justice, and other people are being able to do things that you cant.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In restaurants this will mean making sure tables are back-to-back or even have screens between them. From next Saturday Brits will be able to go out for dinner or go to the pub. But crucially people can only go with one other householdsitting indoors - it doesnt have to be same one every time - but groups shouldnt include more than two household groups. Pubs will only be allowed to provide table service so there will be no crowding around the bar waiting to order a pint. Numbers in venues will also be limited. People are now allowed to go one anothers homes but there can only be one household at a time indoors. There are no limits on the number of people allowed indoors as long as people socially distance, and dont touch - that means no hugging. People dont have to stick to one household to visit either - but they wont be able to do it at the same time. It means families wont have to choose between dferent sets of grandparents - they just wont be able to see them at the same time. Friends and families can also stay overnight as long as theres only one other household. When heading out to a restaurant or pub people will have to give businesses their details. If there is an outbreak, this will enable contact tracers to follow up easily with anyone who may have been in contact with an infected person. Hotels, BBs, holiday lettings and campsites will be allowed to reopen on July th meaning people will be able to spend the first night out of their home for the first time since lockdown. People with second homes will also be allowed to use those. People in England can holiday with one other household as long as social distancing is followed. Hairdressers will also be allowed to reopen and fix many of the DIY hair cuts people resorted to during lockdown. Some hairdressers have said they will open at midnight to get through the backlog of appointments. But people wont be able to go to nail bars or massueses. Indoor gyms, pools casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks, indoor play areas and spas will all stay closedThese are areas the Government has flagged as higher risk. The PM has not yet set out a date he expects theses places to be able to open.Cinemas, theatres, concert halls and places of worshop will be able to resume services. But singing wont be allowed because there is a risk it can spread infection - so this means no opera or hymns at church. Weddings will also be allowed to restart but with a maximum of  guests.   To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It would have been in the paper, there would have been big talk,” Ms Smith said. Grant, who died in , is alleged to have been drinking alcohol on the night of the crash. His  acquittal attracted no major media attention.Grant was acquitted of culpable driving causing death with his lawyers arguing that Mona was behind the wheel when the car crashed.Investigators did not test for Monas fingerprints on the steering wheel. In March this year, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller sent a letter to Attorney-General Mark Speakman stating that two independent inquiries found the police handling to be “adequate”.Mr Fuller said that because Grant is now dead, an inquest into the girls deaths “will adduce new or additional information”.Monas sister Fiona Smith said the police commissioners letters angered her.   She said: “I didnt like what I read in the letters. I dont agree with it and neither does [Monas mother]. Its like theyre ducking and weaving and no one wants to take responsibility.Ms Smiths lawyers have called on the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions to reassess its response.  “What was important was the evidence, accepted by the magistrate, that Cindy was dead when she was found by two independent witnesses, and that an alleged ­offencetook place after that,” solicitor George Newhouse from the National Justice Project said.The -year-old’s mother and Bourke indigenous elder Dawn Smith said the Director of Public Prosecutions decision to drop a sexual offence charge against Grant was “disappointing”.In  a charge against Grant to “offer indignity to a dead human body” was dropped just days out from his District Court Trial.Cindy’s family were not aware of the decision which is reportedly one of the reasons he avoided time in jail. The interference with a corpse charge was later dropped because the coroner was unable to determine the exact time that Cindy died and may have been alive while she was assaulted. Grant never faced any jail time before dying in . Last year the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions apologised for failing to inform the family of the withdrawal of charges but maintained it made the correct legal decision.  “I have not been able to identy any error in the ultimate decision that was made or this ­offices consideration of the relevant legal issues,” NSW Public Prosecutions, Huw Baker SC, told the family in a letter from last November.     Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You can now at last be within ft in of someone outside your immediate household! What’s more, from July , you will be able to eat in restaurants, have a drink and, of course, continue shopping.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWhat you won’t be able to do, unless you are very fortunate, is to get your children into school, which says something about our national priorities. Make no mistake about it, this is a “national emergency”. Education should have the upfront priority that we rightly give the NHS and saving our economy. The failure since the beginning of March to plan ahead for getting all schools and all youngsters back into the classroom has been reprehensible.I say all schools because the majority have been open for the children of key workers and for children designated as vulnerable.Many teachers have been doing a first-class job trying to keep in touch with children at home, providing them with online tuition, homework and marking. But there is still time to mobilise all the necessary resources to make it possible to get children back to school for at least a couple of weeks before the end of this term.Yes, it would involve finding extra premises for schools with inadequate space. Yes, we would have to appeal to teachers who have recently retired to come back for perhaps a few hours a week. Yes, we would need to employ supply teachers.In addition we could use university students, who won’t be finding summer jobs any time soon, to assist.Of course, we don’t have that reliable summer weather that will allow teaching outside on a regular basis, butDenmark can place many lessons in an outside setting, we can.If the French, Lord help us, can get their schools mobilised and back to full operation, we can. Their trade unions are far more bolshy than ours, and teachers regrettably much less well paid.So we need a combination of creativity, imagination and drive to get pupils back. We need to rebuild the confidence of parents and staff that they are highly unlikely to contract the virus from the children, or of the children passing it on to each other.That way, we can have ironed out the glitches and be ready in September to be absolutely on the ball. Small group tutoring for recovery programmes, mentoring not just organised centrally, but co-ordinated locally.For anyone who doesn’t believe that two or three weeks matter in terms of education, when children have been out of school since the middle of March, then think again. This is about equality, narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots, and opening a window on the world. But it is also more than that. It’s a place of social interaction, of well-being and of safety. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the Royal College of Paediatricians, the people whose whole le is spent on the well-being of children. They are very clear: Schools must , children need each other as well as their teachers.The recognition of the importance of schools was something I was proud to oversee in , when the incoming government’s priority slogan was, “education, education, education”.Don’t get me wrong. The belated announcement last week of a one per cent uplt for all schools and a £million pot for an online recovery programme is extremely welcome. A pity, therefore, that in making a really great announcement, the Government managed not to put any money aside for the  to -year-olds in further education, who are surely the target group we would want to be helping the most.So, thank you to all those who have done everything they can to keep the wheels on the cart over the past dficult three and a half months. But now we need both national leadership and local organisation. To use an old adage, we need to think national but we need to act local. Education trusts, local authorities, teachers’ unions and all those committed to the future of this nation should want to come together to make it work.In the next ten days, while the Government thinks about its advice, others can get on with the job. Take what is working best and spread it.What can work in France or Denmark or Germany can certainly work here. We are not out of the woods yet, but we can take logical, rational and brave decisions. That is what leadership is all about.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it’s never quite the same.And therein lies the rub when you marry someone from another country.At first your initial attraction and then love for each other transcends geographical or cultural dferences.But when children come along and you’re required to stay in one place, inevitably one of you has to give up more than the other.Meghan tried it, albeit for a very short time, and now Harry is the one living thousands of miles away from his family and the only le he’s ever known.He made the decision to step down as a senior royal and decamp to the US for the sake of his new family — Meghan and Archie — but that doesn’t make it any less tough to see the old one ticking over nicely without him.A couple of years ago, I was in a central London restaurant with a group of other married couples and, much to the annoyance of we wives, the husbands couldn’t take their eyes off a woman sitting at the bar.Wearing the shortest of dresses, her legs were encircled around the object of her affections and her tongue made frequent visits to his ear.I recognised the man as actor Stephen Campbell Moore, ex-husband of The Crown star Claire Foy, and his obviously smitten companion as Sophie Cookson, who played Christine Keeler in last year’s BBC drama about the Profumo scandal.Fast forward to lockdown and this photo, suggests the couple may now be expecting their first child.The fond arrival of which will mean a heavy-hearted goodbye to those late-night, lust-filled liaisons that had the rest of us drooling with envy.Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson says he amuses himself by lying in interviews then changing his Wikipedia page to match his inventions.It reminds me of my stint as a royal correspondent when, after days of being on the road together, we would challenge each other to use silly names in stories.Hence, “Toby Lerone” was quoted in an article filed from the royals’ favourite ski resort in Switzerland, and in another story to do with Italy, “Sam Buca” made an appearance.Daft, I know, but it amused usno one .Mr Pendragon, who refuses to pay to park, says they stopped him from leaving his car on nearby roads.Shouldn’t he have been on horseback Bored by St Tropez, billionaires are reportedly snapping up “expedition yachts” that will take them to more adventurous corners of the globe.The one owned by US billionaire Ray Dalio has three deep-ing submersibles, and converted former Soviet spy boat Olivia is currently on the market for £million.Back home, lock-down quarantine rules have forced a  per cent rise in multi-millionaire Brits splashing their cash on vast private pools.Meanwhile, the rest of us will make do with a boat in the bath and a paddling pool.Sarah Ferguson – aka Prince Andrew’s ex we – is building up quite a following on her YouTube channel, where she reads children’s books such as The Wonky Donkey and Little Red Riding Hood while wearing fancy dress.Her success is no surprise, because on the many occasions I’ve seen her at charity events, she always connects brilliantly with the children in attendance.But personally, I can’t wait for her to get round to the critically acclaimed Idan Hadari book about a boy who wants to be famous.It’s called Andrew’s Claim To Fame.Or, in the Duke of York’s case, should that be infamy Yep.

Recreational cricket should just play from July .”The full list of businesses includes:Earlier this month, Swim England published a list of guidelines for swimmers called Returning To The Pool.Pools closed on March , along with gyms and other fitness centres as the country went into lockdown.Arriving ready to swim with costumes worn underneath clothes and showering before leaving home, again before entering the pool and then after swimming are some of the recommendations that have been made.Showers may be available at the facility but by arriving wearing your swimwear under your clothing and showering at home pre and post swimming you will help minimise time spent in the changing rooms, the guidelines read.Wide and slower strokes like butterfly should be avoided when lanes are busy, according to the recommendations.Swimmers should also move to the edge of their lane and keep their distance from others while resting.The rules could see a five-lane m pool with just three lanes in use to allow for social distancing.Swimmers would be asked to keep moving in a clock-wise direction in the lanes and lanes could be limited to around five people.Any equipment used in pools will need to be cleaned in between use, while capacity will need to be limited to allow each swimmer six square metres of space.During swimming lessons, teachers will need to stay outside the pool, and only one parent will be allowed to take a child to a lesson.Swimming in wild and open water is still allowed under lockdown rules, and many Brits have been making the most of the warmer weather to enjoy a dip in the ocean.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Government guidance today shows many toilets will need to be one-in, one-out and bar staff hidden behind screens to prevent the spread of the virus. Pubs will be told to keep lists of everyone who comes in for  days in case there is an outbreak - with more outdoor seats and tape to mark distance on the floor. Bar managers will be told to work with their rivals on the same street to make sure they stagger their opening times. And punters will be warned they canapost shelter insidea rainstorm - otherwise they could cause an outbreak. We knew a lot of the restrictions already. For example, you can only sit indoors with one other household - socially distanced. If youaposre in the beer garden, you can sit in a group of up to six - socially distanced - or in a group of two households of any size. Now the governmentaposs guidance shows just how dferent the new normal will be to le before. Here are  key ways itaposll change your experience of the pub. . Loud music or broadcasts will be banned to stop people shouting  Loud music or loud broadcasts like football will be banned to stop people shouting at each other. The guidance says all venues should ensure that steps are taken to avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed at a volume that makes normal conversation dficult. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission, particularly from aerosol transmission. It also says loud background music, communal dancing, group singing or chanting should be prevented. . Live music and comedy will be banned  The guidance says venues should not permit live performances, including drama, comedy and music, to take place in front of a live audience. This is to stop aerosol transmission - from either the performer or their audience. Theatres are likewise allowed to open but onlythey donapost put on a live show. . Ketchup bottles and cutlery are banished from tables  The guidance says pubs and restaurants should provide cutlery and condiments only when food is served. And the days of the communal ketchup or mayonnaise bottle are numbered - as pubs and restaurants should provide only disposable condiments. Communal bottles are allowed but onlythey are cleaned after every single use. . Everyone has to give their name to staff - and itaposs kept for  days  All pubs, bars, restaurants and more are being told to assist with the NHS Test and Trace programme. That means keeping a temporary record of your customers and visitors for  days. The guidance doesnapost say how this should be done but lists visitor books or bookings records. Pubs will need to assist NHS Test and Trace with requests for that dataneeded in order to contain clusters or outbreaks. . Bar staff will stand behind screens  The guidance recommends using screens or barriers to separate workers from each other, and from customers at points of service. That could mean bar staff serving from behind a perspex screen to avoid transmission. Staff are also asked to use back-to-back or side-to-side working possible. And staff rotas will need to be redrawn so each person only has contact with a fixed number of others on their team. Tables will be spaced further apart and floor tape or paint will be used to mark areas to help people comply with social distancing. They should be two metres apart - or one metrethere is risk mitigation in place like screens, back-to-back seating or face coverings. . Some toilets will be one-in, one-out  The guidance recommends one way flow systems to stop people bunching up - such as using one door as an entry and one as an exit. Pubs should also arrange one-way travel routes between transport hubs and venues, it says. But thataposs a problem when it comes to pub toilets, many of which are cramped with narrow entrances. On toilets, the guidance urges pubs to use a limited entry approach, with one in, one out. . Youaposll get more outdoor seats, table service - and use apps to order your drinks  Pubs are being encouraged to put in more outdoor seats - with changes coming down the track to let them use car parks as beer gardens. Outdoor table service should also be encouraged, the guidance says - and table service should be followed as a rule to stop people queues. Where bar or counter service is unavoidable, people should be stopped from staying at the bar or counter after ordering, or leaning on it. Pubs are also told to encourage use of contactless ordering from tables where available - for example, through an ordering app. . Staff could radio food orders through to the kitchen Staff are told to reduce movement by discouraging non-essential trips within venues. That could mean restricting access to some areas, encouraging use of radios, telephones or other electronic devices when sending orders from service areas to kitchens, where permitted. The radios would have to be cleaned between use. . Youaposll be banned from propping up the bar - or sheltering from the rain  Pubs are warned they have to plan for keeping the -metre or aposone metre plusapos rules eventhere is a thunderstorm. They need to be clear that customers cannot seek shelter indoors unless social distancing can be maintained. . Indoor spaces will have to be massively below capacity  Sitting indoors will be allowed - but numbers are strictly limited. New coronavirus laws from July  in England will make it illegal for groups of more than  people to form, except for limited circumstances. That means pubs may have to lower capacity even further than it would bethey had all tables two metres apart. The guidance explains: Evenit is possible to safely seat a number of people inside a venue, it may not be safe for them all to travel or enter that venue. . Youaposll see this sign in the window  Pubs should work with their customers to tell them about the restrictions on gatherings. That means not gathering indoors with more than one other household. And it means not gathering outdoors with more than either one other household, or six people in total from any number of households. In , firms should also display a notication in a prominent place to show a risk assessment has been carried out and theyaposre following the rules. A picture of the notice is above. . Nearby pubs must work together to open at dferent times Inidual businesses should consider the cumulative impact of many venues re-opening in a small area. This means working with local authorities, neighbouring businesses and travel operators to assess this risk and applying additional mitigations. This might have to include staggering entry times with other venues and taking steps to avoid queues building up in surrounding areas.

Things you can do from July  Venues that CAN reopen in England from July  All these venues can reopen in England providing they can show they are aposCovid-secureapos:Hotels and BBs Holiday apartments or homes Cottages or bungalows Campsites Caravan parks Boarding houses Places of worship Libraries Community centres Restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens Bars Pubs Cinemas Bingo halls Theatres and concert halls - but on the basis it’s not a live performance. They can only screen past performances for example Museums and galleries Hair salons and barbers Outdoor playgrounds Outdoor gyms Funfairs Theme parks Adventure parks and activities Amusement arcades Other indoor leisure centres and facilities - including indoor gaming, social clubs, model villages, and indoor attractions at aquariums and zoos.You can finally visit friends and family indoors - but you canapost hug  People in England can have friends and family round to their house to eat, hang out and stay overnight from July  - but they can’t hug. For the first time since March, indoor gatherings will be allowed between two households who havenapost joined together in a “bubble”. Bubbles - a permanent joining of two households which let people break social distancing rules - aren’t being expanded, for now. But new rules will allow two households in England to meet indoors. This applies to all indoor gatherings, be they in private homes or in places like pubs. When you are indoors, your household will be able to meet with one other household at a time. That potentially includes staying over at someone’s house.  There is no limit on the size of either of the households which can meet. And unlike with bubbles, ’exclusivity’ is not required. So you can have one friend round for a meal one weekend and another friend round another weekend. But there’s a big catch - these households should continue to remain socially distant from one another when they meet, That means following the m or ‘m plus’ guidance, and also following other advice such as regular hand washing. You can meet more people outdoors  There will be a slight change to the rules for people meeting outdoors from July . Currently up to six people from up to six households can meet in a park or garden,they maintain social distancing. This will continue, but there will also now be another option. Two households of any size - for example, two families of four - will now also be allowed to meet outdoors, as long as they maintain social distancing. So you can either meet five friends from dferent households, or an unlimited number of friends from one household. The two-metre rule will be cut  Changes will be made to the -metre rule in England from July . Where it’s not possible to stay  metres apart, people will instead be advised to keep to a social distance of “one metre plus”. This means staying one metre apart - plus mitigations which reduce the risk of transmission. On public transport it means people stay one metre away but with a face covering. In other spaces it will likely mean having screens between tables, making sure people face away from each other, putting in hand washing facilities, minimising amount of time spent with people from dferent households., and being outdoors where possible. Government sources claim having such mitigations in place at one metre away can have a “broadly equivalent impact” on transmission as staying two metres apart. But it comes despite grave warnings of the danger of moving people closer together. Scientists say the risk of catching coronavirus from someone is  to  times higher at one metre away compared to two metres away. Yet now fewer people have coronavirus in society overall, the overall risk of catching it is lower. And Tory MPs and the pub trade have piled pressure on Boris Johnson to cut the distance to save the economy. Crucially, the review was led by No and while it took advice from scientists, they had no powers of veto. Economists also contributed to the review.  Pubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and workplace canteens can all reopen in England from July  - both indoor and outdoors. But thereaposs a catch -youaposre indoors, you can only meet with people from one other household. And you should still maintain social distancing rules. That means staying either two metres apart, or one metre apart with mitigation measuresyou canapost manage two metres. It means no propping up the bar or standing in groups, and pubs will be encouraged to have table service where possible. All venues - from pubs to places of worship - will be expected to keep a record of people who visit, to enable contact tracing. But landlords won’t be expected to police what household customers belong to, or check ID of everyone coming in. Guidance for pubs will be published later today. You can get a haircut - but canapost get your nails done  Hairdressers and barbers will be allowed to reopen in England from July  with protective measures - including face visors for those cutting hair. It means millions of Brits can finally get a haircut after more than three months of having their locks chopped at home. But nail salons, which involve people sitting face to face, will remain shut for the foreseeable. You can go on staycation to English hotels, BBs and campsites - but not hostels  Hotels, BBs, holiday apartments or homes, cottages or bungalows, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses can all reopen to paying guests in England from July . Again, they must follow Covid-secure guidelines - but people will be able to stay overnight away from their home. Despite concerns over shared facilities, campsites will be able to reopen in England from July . This would include showers and washing-up blocks. There will be Covid-secure guidelines to minimise the spread of the virus. But hostels with shared bedrooms cannot yet. This is dferent to Wales which is keeping both campsites and hostels shut. You can go to visit cinemas, galleries and museums  The government has now officially set the date of Saturday  July for cinemas, galleries and museums to reopen in England. Guidance will be published shortly on how to keep them safe - including one-way systems, spaced queuing, increased ventilation, and pre-booked tickets. A No source said: We are only able to move forward this week because the vast majority of people have taken steps to control the virus. But the more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing guidelines. We will not hesitate to reverse these stepsit is necessary to stop the virus running out of control.  Today comes hot on the heels of last nightaposs announcement that shielding will be eased for .million vulnerable people in England. From July  shielding people can go out and meet up to five friends - andthey live alone, form a aposbubbleapos with another household. From August , the advice to shield ends completely. But Statutory Sick Pay and direct food parcels for the shielding will also end on August , prompting alarm. Thereaposs also anger at the failure to have a legal safeguard against people being forced back to work. Things you still canapost do from July  Venues that CANaposT reopen in England from July  Government sources said “it’s not felt that at this moment in time it’s possible” for those venues to reopen. Task forces will be set up to try to get these venues open in a safe way. Nightclubs Bowling alleys and skating rinks Indoor play areas including soft play Spas Nail bars Beauty salons Swimming pools Tattoo and piercing studios Massage parlours Water parks Indoor fitness and dance studios Gyms Conference centres, other than for people who already work there. You canapost go to the gym  Government sources said gyms remain shut because there is a “far greater risk of infection” due to people breathing harder and touching surfaces. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden later insisted: Subject to public health, our aspiration is to reopen gyms  leisure facilities in mid-July. You canapost send your child to school  Only years R,  and  are allowed back to primary schools in England at the moment. The government wants all children back in September - but was forced to drop plans to do it earlier. Full plans for September are due to be announced next week. You canapost see a live theatre show  Theatres and concert halls can reopen in England from July  - with a catch. They can only reopen on the basis it’s not a live performance. Instead theatres and concert halls can screen past performances. Government sources said theatres have an issue with ensuring the actors themselves can move around the stage in a safe way. You canapost sing in church Worship will be allowed - but not full singing services due to the risk of spreading the virus. There will be further guidance about singing. You can get married, but not have a proper reception  Wedding services with up to  people will be allowed from July . But trips to indoor hospitality venues should still only be with one other household - in other words, the rules make wedding receptions almost impossible. This also applies to baptisms and Bar Mitzvahs and other “le cycle events”. The number of people allowed to celebrate a wedding will be increased at some point but it’s not known when or by how much. You canapost play cricket, football or rugby, except with your own household "},{"url":null,"title":"labour try force government publish","story":"NewsLabour will try to force government to publish papers on Tory donor planning rowLabour will push a vote in the Commons to release correspondence on Westferry Printworks, a housing development planned by millionaire mogul Richard DesmondShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick has the full confidence of No \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Labour Party will today attempt to push a vote in the House of Commons in order to require officials to release correspondence relating to Westferry Printworks, a housing development planned by millionaire mogul Richard Desmond.The redevelopment, said to be worth £ billion, was approved in January by Mr Jenrick against the recommendation of a planning inspector. The decision was reversed after legal action by Tower Hamlets Council and Mr Jenrick accepted his decision was “unlawful by reason of apparent bias”. Two weeks after the minister stepped in to approve the scheme, Electoral Commission records show that Mr Desmond personally gave £, to the Conservatives. Steve Reed, Labour’s Communities and Local Government Secretary, said: “The Secretary of State has admitted he knew his unlawful, biased decision to approve Richard Desmond’s property deal would save the Conservative Party donor up to £ million, but there are still far too many questions left unanswered.“It is essential the Government maintains public trust during the coronavirus crisis. Dominic Cummings and now Westferry have severely tested this – the Government’s moral authority hangs by a thread."},{"url":null,"title":"uk told prepare second wave","story":"NewsUK told to prepare for second wave of coronavirus amid fears rules relaxed too soonThe UKs leading medical experts have called for an urgent review of whether the country is properly prepared for the \"real risk\" of another fight against coronavirusShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political EditorChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video professor-chris-whitty-should-planning-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics uk-told-prepare-second-wave-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Britainaposs leading medical experts have written an open letter calling for an urgent review of whether the country is properly prepared for the real risk of another fight against Covid-. Earlier modelling has suggested a new peak could hit after Christmas and kill as many as  people a day. The letter published in the British Medical Journal warns ministers that urgent action is needed to prevent further loss of le and to protect the economy amid growing fears of a renewed outbreak over the winter. The appeal is backed by the presidents of the Royal Colleges of Physicians, Surgeons, GPs and Nursing - as well as the chairman of the British Medical Association. It comes after Boris Johnson announced on Tuesday the biggest easing to date of the coronavirus lockdown in England. The Prime Minister said the two-metre social-distancing rule would be replaced with a one-metre plus rule paving the way for pubs, restaurants, hotels and cinemas to begin reopening from July . In an open letter to the leaders of all the UK political parties published in the British Medical Journal, the health leaders call for a rapid and forward-looking assessment of the state of national preparedness in the event of a renewed flare-up. While the future shape of the pandemic in the UK is hard to predict, the available evidence indicates that local flare ups are increasingly likely and a second wave a real risk, they said. Many elements of the infrastructure needed to contain the virus are beginning to be put in place, but substantial challenges remain. The job now is not only to deal urgently with the wide-ranging impacts of the first phase of the pandemic, but to ensure that the country is adequately prepared to contain a second phase. They called for the creation of a cross-party commission with a constructive, non-partisan, four nations approach, to be established to develop practical recommendations for action based on what had been learned so far.  We believe this will be essentialthe UK is to get ahead of the curve, they said. It should focus on those areas of weakness where action is needed urgently to prevent further loss of le and restore the economy as fully and as quickly as possible. We think thereaposs a strong case for an immediate assessment of national preparedness, with the first results available no later than August, and that all its work should be completed by the end of October. Ministers have already said that the temporary Nightingale Hospitals set up in case the NHS was overwhelmed by Covid- cases will remain on standby over the coming months.  The letter comes as former chief scientic advisor Sir David King, who now leads the unofficial ‘Independent Sage’ group, told Sky News the lockdown easing is “ extraordinarily risky”. He said lting lockdown too quickly means “the risk of running into a second wave becomes very signicant”. He added: “We must aim to completely get rid of the virus of this country before the winter” “We still see , new cases at least a day in this country. I don’t think there’s anyone who can believe from the scientic point of view that this is a wise move.” Imperial College economist Professor David Miles told BBC Radio  the easing of lockdown measures was overdue. He said: We probably have gone past the point some weeks ago where the benefits of keeping in place the lockdown were large enough to match the rising and enormous costs of lockdown. In other developments: - The Government is providing £ million to help prevent vulnerable people given emergency accommodation during the pandemic being ed to the streets. - Labour is calling for NHS staff to undergo weekly testing for coronavirus in order to ensure waiting list backlogs can be safely cleared. - First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the two-metre rule would remain in place in Scotland. Announcing, the easing of the two-metre rule in England, Mr Johnson said the Government was taking a cautious approach and that ministers will not hesitate to apply the brakes in the event of an upsurge in the disease. Want to keep up to date with the latest from Westminster to our newsletter to receive regular news, expert comment and analysis from our Mirror Politics team.  However at the final daily No  briefing, both the Governmentaposs chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and the chief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty stressed it was not a risk-free move. Prof Whitty said it was absolutely critical that people continued to observe social distancing, taking steps to mitigate the spread of the disease when it was not possible to stay two metres apart. He warned the virus was likely to be present in the UK until at least the spring of  and thatpeople ed to their normal patterns of behaviour we will get an uptick for sure. Sir Patrick also warned that despite the falling numbers of people infected with the disease, the threat remained. Donapost be fooled that this means it has gone away. The disease is growing across the world. It is coming down in the UK but it hasnapost gone away, he said.  The easing of the two-metre rule was warmly welcomed by the hospitality sector which had warned that many pubs, cafes and restaurants would be forced to closeit remained in place. Hairdressers, barbers, cinemas, museums and art galleries in England are now also preparing to open their doors to visitors again from July . However close proximity businesses including nightclubs, soft play centres, indoor gyms, nail bars and beauty salons will remain shut, as will bowling alleys and water parks. Professor John Edmunds, who attends Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesmeetings, said the Governmentaposs switch to one metre-plus restrictions could put the country at risk of increased Covid- transmission. The London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine academic told BBC Radio aposs Today programme on Wednesday: The easements that are coming are going to have a double effect really because we are going to be allowed to go to pubs and restaurants and so on, and so that will increase our number of contacts.

How could I forget  We’d been ­reminiscing about our fun times at secondary school, gossiping behind books in maths, and laughing until we cried in the canteen. However, we were sidetracked by the startling memory of my intelligent, well-behaved friend getting an excessive punishment for using a Caribbean expression of irritation that, though commonplace to us, was alien to our teacher, and unfairly read as offensive. Remembering this moment of youthful injustice, as chants of “Black Lives Matter” and tales of cross-cultural mishaps fill newspapers and social media, feels incredibly timely. For a number of black British people, school is the first arena where you realise your race will have a direct effect on your le experience. Through the texts taught in English and drama – mostly by white authors, about white characters – to the limited time dedicated to the history of black people, you begin to get the feeling that the stories of your ancestors aren’t worthy of telling, or that characters with names with similar origins to your own are outside of the norm. Unorm and appearance ­policies may discriminate against your natural hair while teachers who don’t ­understand the way you express ­yourself may be too eager to punish.  Four months ago, Ruby Williams won a £, settlement from her East London school after a three-year legal battle – she had been repeatedly sent home because theof her natural afro hair was deemed to be against unorm policy. The Timpson review on school exclusions, released in May , revealed black and mixed students in ­particular have been excluded at disproportionate rates compared to their white peers. And when there are day-to-day cultural crossed wires, as well as discriminative policies which penalise students for being who they are, it is easy to see reasons why. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence to prove many black people feel let down by teachers due to institutionally racist structures. It is not just in the past. A -year-old mixed race student from York who we will call Celine, says secondary school has left her ­disappointed at the way her teachers fail to intervene with racial incidents. “I heard a rumour of an ‘N-word pass’ going around my classmates,” she says, “where anyone who had it would be ‘allowed’ to say the word with no ­consequences. “I’m the only person in the school with black heritage. It was a joke to everyone , but only I was the one who really ­understood the pain, and the history behind it.” Celine reported the matter to mainly white staff. Yet, while the school’s written policy declared no tolerance for offensive language, she was dismayed to find that the culprit was back in class as usual the next day. “I know this student’s character I’m sure it’s just a misunderstanding,” the student-liaison officer explained. “It felt asthe teachers just expected me to get over it, and that they didn’t understand why I was feeling so affected by it,” Celine says. “It makes me feel asconcerns about racial abuse aren’t important.” Figures published in  found just % of state-funded schools’ teachers are from black and other minority ­backgrounds, compared to % of pupils.  This means an extra , teachers from BAME backgrounds are needed to reflect school populations. For some black pupils, negative experiences in school can also stem from staff members’ implicit bias. Entrepreneur Quincy Dash recalls an occasion where, in his Liverpool sixth-form college, a teacher gave him the nickname “Trouble”. Quincy was the only black student in the class. “She’d just met me, and I was even wearing a suit – so why was I ‘Trouble’ to her ” he asks. Trainee solicitor Zoe Browne remembers her experience at school in Islington, North London, in the early s as one where she had to fiercely advocate for herself in order to receive the chance to achieve high grades. One teacher refused to enter her for the Higher GCSE business exam, opting for the Foundation level exam and effectively capping her grade at C , instead of a potential A* .  Zoe explained to the teacher she needed to take the Higher paper to boost her chances of becoming a lawyer. She was told: “People like you don’t become lawyers. You can go on to do your Hair and Beauty BTEC I don’t think A Levels are for you”. This declaration drove Zoe to tears. “Most black students were entered for the Foundation paper teachers didn’t care about us,” she says, certain that race, rather than capability, was the deciding factor. Eventually, her teacher relented, and Zoe achieved a B .  In , then Education Minister Damian Hinds said “far more teachers from ethnic minorities” are needed in schools and to be role models – a sentiment echoed by teachers. I spoke to a teacher, based in South East London, who told the positive effect she had as one of the only black educators at her previous school. “There was such a love and affinity for me because I really saw them, and they saw themselves in me,” she admits. “We all need role models because it instils in you the knowledge of what you can achieve. “Systemic racism means while white people can look on the TV, in ­magazines and in their schools for examples of positive role models, it’s not the same for black students, and it puts them at a disadvantage.” Institutional racism affects teachers too. A poll in January  by teachers’ union NASUWT reveals the majority of black and minority ethnic teachers have experienced micro-insults and other forms of covert racism in the past year. On top of that there is a reported lack of promotion opportunities.

The big eater is only a size ten but she refuses to let her small frame put her off.  She munched through the giant portion - five times larger than the average serving - in  minutes, and then finished it off by downing a pint. The -year-old was challenged to take on the estimated , calorie feast by Ancell’s Fish and Chips in Kate’s hometown of Fleet, Hampshire. The tasty treat was so large that it had to be served on a tray, because the huge cod fillet measured  inches long. Kate said: I’ve had fish and chips from Ancell’s a couple of times since they re-opened, so when they offered to create this challenge just for me, I jumped at the chance. It was so big, they couldn’t wrap it up, so I had to take it home in the tray. “The batter was crisp and crunchy, and the fish was flaky – it was perfect. “I had to switch things up with the curry sauce towards the end, but it was a delight.”Kate took on the colossal cod and chips, served with mushy peas, curry sauce and even gravy, for a Facebook video that has already been viewed more than m times in just a week.To recreate a trip to the seaside, Kate washed down her dinner with a pint of Peroni she poured herself. She said: “I can’t stress just how much I enjoyed this challenge. “It was a bit daunting at first, because I didn’t know where to start, but once I got stuck in, every bite was a delight. “They created this challenge just for me, so it’s not available to the public. “But it’s five times larger than their normal portions. “The cod fillet was absolutely huge, but after the first bite, I knew I’d be able to conquer this challenge, because it was absolutely delicious. “I wasn’t timing myself, but it took about  minutes to finish because I really wanted to savour every bite.” Kate is famed for taking on huge food challenges, including a three-foot long sausage roll, and Britain’s biggest hotdog. Her food challenge videos regularly get millions of views online, and she has more than , followers on her Kate Ovens Facebook fan page. Kate has received thousands of comments on her newest video, and is already planning her next challenge. She said: “It’s been great to support my local chippy.

Scientists believe the cold air inside the food processing factories could make those inside more susceptible. The close working conditions and ventilation problems aposincrease the risk of infectionapos. This new blow comes after Anglesey and Wrexham food plants also reported a high level of positive tests. But Vaughan Gething, a health minister in Wales, doesnapost think local communities are at risk.The MP for Cardf South and Penarth said: We have two confirmed coronavirus outbreaks, centred on two meat and food processing plants- one on Anglesey and one in Wrexham.In addition, there is a small cluster of cases at a meat processing plant in Merthyr Tydfil. I want to restate, that at the moment, there is no evidence of wider community transmission beyond these plants.  But he stressed numbers are falling across Wales We have seen fewer than  cases each day in the first few weeks of June, he added. There has been an increase over the weekend, which is probably related to these outbreaks.

Mohamed Derbah said Palmer used the alleged tape in a failed bid to stop a timeshare fraud probe that would land him in jail. The extraordinary allegation can be revealed as police issue a new appeal for information on the fth anniversary of Palmer’s unsolved murder. Derbah, at the centre of Palmer’s Tenere empire for a decade, said his former boss got the tape through underworld contacts. He said: “He launched into a coup d’etat against the British Government, which, although it did not succeed, showed his arrogance and contempt for the law.”  Derbah claimed the video “got into the hands” of people close to the top of Government with a message from Palmer “to leave him alone and close the police investigation”. He added: “It showed Palmer’s determination to avoid... going to prison.” Palmer, , was again facing jail when he was shot by a hitman in his garden in South Weald, Essex, on June , . He had been told that week he would stand trial in Spain on claims of timeshare fraud, money laundering and firearms offences. There was speculation in the underworld that he was offering to inform on other criminals infor having the charges dropped. Police believe this is the most likely motive for his murder. Lebanese-born Derbah, , became Palmer’s right-hand man after they met in  in Liberia and Sierra Leone where they were involved in the diamond trade.  His extraordinary claims are made in a book called Mohamed Jamil Derbah, The True History of an Entrepreneur, which was published in Spanish. It tells how Palmer – dubbed Goldfinger after smelting gold from the £million Brink’s-Mat robbery in  – asked Derbah to work for him in Tenere as the CEO of his hotel business. In the s Palmer was at the peak of his powers and was worth an estimated £million. Derbah says he was surrounded by his British pals known as “The Family” including Kenneth Noye, who he protected when the thug went on the run for the  road rage murder of Stephen Cameron.  The relationship between Derbah and Palmer began to sour in  and they became locked in a feud over rival timeshare operations in Tenere. Derbah said Palmer was “destroyed by his ambitions” and that he “adored evil” which meant he could not “escape his powerful enemies”.

Christian Brueckner has submitted a fresh application for early release on a drug conviction and Germanyaposs courts are now trying to decide who has jurisdiction over his case. German prosecutors who are investigating him in the McCann case have vowed he will not be back on the streets, however. Brueckner, , is in prison in Kiel after being sentenced to  months for drug trafficking in Germany and seven years for raping a -year-old American woman in Praia da Luz, Portugal - the resort where three-year-old Madeleine vanished in . Brueckner is seeking parole after completing two-thirds of his drug sentence on June , raising fears he could flee Germanyhe is granted early release and go to a country that does not have an extradition agreement. However, German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the investigation into Brueckner, said he will be arrestedhe is released from prison. The prosecutor recently told the Sunday People: “There is another arrest warrant for raping an older woman from authorities here in Braunschweig. If the court in Kiel says he can leave jail, he will be arrested.”  He initially applied to the regional court in Braunschweig, where he previously lived, but then withdrew his application and submitted it to the regional court in Kiel, where he is in prison. Both courts have said the case was outside their jurisdiction. The matter is now in the hands of Germanyaposs highest court, which confirmed it would decideBrueckner should be granted parole. Brueckner is also appealing his December  rape conviction and could be freed on July the European Court of Justice rules in his favour and overturns it. He is challenging it because German police extradited him from Portugal for a separate drugs conviction and then put him on trial for the rape of the American woman, who was attacked in her flat in Praia da Luz in September , about  months before Maddie disappeared. Brueckneraposs lawyers are arguing that this was illegal. But because he is appealing against the rape conviction, under German law the sentence is yet to be imposed. The ruling is set to be made on July  in a hearing that has been fast-tracked because of the unusual circumstances of the case.  There are three potential outcomes of any ECJ ruling. The first is that the Portuguese could give retrospective permission for the extradition on the rape charge, so that the conviction stands and Brueckner stays inside for his seven-year sentence. The second is that the ECJ could order a retrial of the rape. The third possibility is that the judge could rule there should not have been a trial, the conviction is overturned, Brueckner is released and he cannot be rearrested. He could then leave and go to a country that does not have an extradition agreement with Germany.

Well-wishers collected more than £, for Emma Flynn, who never got to say goodbye to Joshua Flynn, , and their children Coby-Jay,  and Skylar, . They died alongside the family Yorkshire Terrier, Troy, after being hit by a vehicle while out for a Fatheraposs Day walk in Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria. As a suspected drink driver continued to be questioned, Joshuaaposs heartbroken brother Matthew paid tribute with a picture of them together. He wrote on Facebook: This is how I will always remember you Josh. We didn’t always see eye to eye and had our ups and downs, but what brothers don’t. Right now my heart is broken with such an intense and overwhelming pain. I can’t stop thinking about you and poor Coby and Skylar.  Love you all Josh. My thoughts will always be with Emma. Specialist police officers are with the widow as she comes to terms with the loss of her family. A -year-old-man was held on suspicion of drink driving and three counts of causing death by dangerous driving. Nicola Barnes, who set up the fund for Emma, said: “Any parent could only imagine the heartache of losing our entire world in an instant without even getting to say goodbye. I’m calling on the whole community to step up and let her know that we’ll be with her every step of the way. None of us can truly comprehend what she’s going through, which is why it’s so important that she can grieve in peace without having to stress about paying for funerals or counselling.Nothing will make this horrendous situation more bearable for Emma, butthere’s anything we can do to help, we’ve got a duty to try.

Chantelle Bennett, , and her partner Rebecca Tantrum, , lashed out at Paul Sutton after he grabbed their dogaposs lead to prevent further attack. Prosecutor Matthew Roberts said Mr Sutton had been walking his own dog when Bennett and Tantrumaposs pet bit him outside their flat. But the women became enraged when Mr Sutton took hold of the animalaposs lead in a bid to control it. Mr Roberts said: Chantelle Bennett was shouting at Mr Sutton, ‘Let go of my dog’. She was screaming at him. “She approached with a bottle in her hand and she was indeed trying to hit his partner with the bottle. “Mr Sutton pushed her to the back of the neck and to the floor. “She smashed the bottle of Desperadoes alcohol. Rebecca Tantrum left the address and came towards Mr Sutton with the hammer. “During the incident, Bennett shouted, ‘Go on. Whack him!’ and Tantrum said, ‘I’m going to kill you.’”  CCTV showed Tantrum swinging the hammer at Mr Suttonaposs body and Bennett punching him before the three fall to the floor. Cardf Crown Court heard they grappled before police arrived at the scene in Newport city centre. Bennett and Tantrum, of Newport, admitted actual bodily harm and Tantrum also admitted possessing an offensive weapon and cannabis. Jeffrey Jones, defending, Bennett said: “There was an element of provocation. She was manhandled to the ground.” Rosamund Rutter, for Tantrum, said: “She is appalled by her actions.” But the women were spared jail because of police delays in bringing the case to court. Judge Jeremy Jenkins said he was unable to lock the women up because the attack happened almost a year ago and the women hadnapost been charged sooner. He said: Each of these defendants deserves to go immediately into custody for their violent behaviour.

The heatwave will peak on Thursday - but it is unlikely to break the  record for the hottest June day ever. Wednesday will be nearly as hot with some parts of the UK hitting c. Good news is on the way for those who donapost enjoy the intense heat - cooler air is expected from Saturday. Met Office forecaster Luke Miall said: Weaposve got high pressure to the South East of the UK over the next few days which is going to be drawing our air up from the continent. But although itaposs fairly uncommon to get C in June at the moment, it doesnapost look like weaposre going to break any of the records. Today is the start of an official heatwave in the UK. The Met Office says that heatwaves are counted when a temperature peaks at  in London and  in the north for three consecutive days. But those with hayfever will want the weekend to hurry up and arrive. Wednesday is the worst day for pollen with the whole of the UK, bar the north of Scotland, measuring very high levels. A Met Office spokesman said: There are also loads of factors that change the start date of the pollen season. Low temperatures in winter will keep plants and trees dormant for longer into the new year. Essentially, the lower the temperature the less pollen is produced, but, this can changesoil and air temperatures in spring are higher than normal. Friday will also be very hot - but thunderstorms are expected in many places. There is widespread risk of torrential downpours, rain, hail as the weekend approaches.

Professor Sarah Gilbert, leading the University of Oxford vaccine trial, said that when Covid- transmission was high, lockdown was imposed to bring the rate down. But since then rates have dropped, and the trial relies on a sufficient number of volunteers to have been exposed to the virus to see whether a vaccine protects them or not. However,their chances of being in contact with an infected person are low, it will take a long time to demonstrate the efficacy of a vaccine candidate. Prof Gilbert told the House of Lords Science and Technology committee: Of course, what happened was that because it [transmission] actually increased much more rapidly than anybody thought was going to happen, we had the lockdown, which fortunately reduced transmission. Not so fortunate for those of us trying to develop vaccines in the UK, because we now have essentially a very large safety immunogenicity study, running in the UK with little chance, frankly, of determining efficacy. She added that the researchersapos approach was to work with multiple dferent countries in dferent settings to give them the best chance of seeing efficacy in at least one of those countries. The committee heard the Oxford team is already running a trial in Brazil because the numbers of transmissions are much higher than in the UK. As soon as we get a signal of efficacy and can compare that to the level of immunity that weaposre generating, that gives all vaccine developers really helpful information to let them know whether their vaccines are likely to work as well, and whether it will be one dose or two doses, and in older people and in younger people, she said. Follow all coronavirus updates here on our live blog So the first efficacy signal is going to be really important and as yet we donapost know which country will be generating that. Prof Gilbert and Professor Robin Shattock, who is leading the Imperial College London trial, said they were optimistic about their vaccine approaches but cautioned that optimism should be balanced against known risk of success. Prof Shattock said vaccine success rates tend to be at about % once you start clinical testing, but added: I think in the UK we are very lucky that we have two [vaccine] candidates that are already in clinical evaluation. We think that probably both of those will work inidually.

He did an exemplary job at St Johnstone and I would have no concerns about the Terrors under his stewardship.For now, the Tangerines will be licking their wounds, though, because this one will sting for a while.The sub-plot of Hearts’ legal action against the SPFL, which could threaten United’s promotion to the Premiership, is bubbling under the surface. While the rapid exit of Robbie for his former club doesn’t sit right with me.From a footballing perspective I can see how the move would make sense for Robbie and the Jambos – he’ll feel he has unfinished business there as a Hearts man.However, I think the problems might run a little deeper than Robbie wanting toto Gorgie.It could work out well for United, getting compensation and a new manager, of course, but there will be a lot of questions to answer from confused fans and staff alike.Just when it seemed things were settling down, United are back in disarray.It is, of course, not a positive situation for them right now but Dundee need to be thankful for what they’ve got.Last week’s statement from John Nelms will have sent shivers down the spines of Dark Blues scarred by two administrations since the turn of the century.It’s clear the coronavirus is going to have a huge impact on the club’s finances, and they are not the only ones, but they have to look at what they have in place as a huge plus.Dundee say #tough choices# must be made to protect the future of the club amid a grim financial reality\" title\"#Dundee say #tough choices# must be made to protect the future of the club amid a grim financial reality# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-john-nelms-finances-future embed # secrettSsuFoaHq\" data-secret\"tSsuFoaHq\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Boss James McPake has a playing squad which isn’t a million miles away from being ready, there is an insurance policy in place which could be a lesaver and, most importantly, the Americans are clearly committed to staying put at Dens Park.It was a realistic statement from Nelms but not a death knell or the end of his and owner Tim Keyes’ involvement with the Dee.They may have to curtail some of their grand plans, like the stadium, and might not be able to give McPake a huge budget but the club is in the safest of hands.I was bitterly disappointed with the Merseyside derby on Sunday.The quality on display just wasn’t there and without the fans, rival clashes inThe supporters make these games and watching such a massive game with fake fan noise in the background made for a strange atmosphere.This isn’t football. The sooner we get bums back on seats the better!I hope the financial impact of the coronavirus doesn’t lead to Dundee following Hibs in mothballing their academy.For me, times like this are when clubs should be investing in their young players.Former Dundee United manager Craig Levein would #never say never# to Tannadice \" title\"#Former Dundee United manager Craig Levein would #never say never# to Tannadice # # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp former-dundee-united-manager-craig-levein-would-never-say-never-to-tannadice- embed # secretjjsgqCov\" data-secret\"jjsgqCov\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

undertaken by Glasgow Warriorsrsquo professional players.ldquoWhen yoursquore walking in and around Selkirk, you canrsquot help noticing pieces of litter that have been left lying around, often when proper bins arenrsquot that far away, said Nixon.ldquoI thought it would be a good idea for Selkirk players to take a bin bag with them when they head out to take their daily exercise, picking up any litter they see next to paths or along roadside verges.ldquoWersquore lucky in Selkirk to have such unspoilt countryside to exercise in, so itrsquos a shame to see it spoiled by discarded empty bottles, food wrappers and general rubbish.ldquoI kicked off the campaign by nominating three members of our players ndash Aaron McColm, Ewan MacDougall and Liam Cassidy ndash to collect litter on their walks.ldquoEach of this trio will then challenge a further three players to collect litter, and in turn these three will nominate other team-mates, and so on.The project has the backing of Selkirk head coach Scott Wight.He said: ldquoItrsquos another way the club can put something back into the local community, though this time therersquos no sponsorship involved.ldquoItrsquos looking

the Selkirk community.Meanwhile, Selkirk Rugby Club is to stage its annual Players Presentation Night on Fridayndash although this yearrsquos event will be a lsquovirtualrsquo get-together.The plan is for the clubrsquos coaches, players and rugby officials to be digitally linked via Zoom, with Selkirk head coach Scott Wight taking charge of proceedings.ldquoThe idea is to try and stick as closely as possible to the format normally used at the clubrsquos annual presentation nights, said Wight.ldquoA total of nine trophies are up for grabs, and the name of each award winner will be announced

infected person will pass the virus to on average.Coronavirus has an estimated reproduction number of three, meaning an infected person will likely pass the virus on to at least three other people.A

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

Its five seams ied in width from one to three metres, the best coal lying m deep and requiring innovative deep mining technology to extract.The new steam engines solved the perennial problem of pumping out water.Being next to Morrisonrsquos Haven for easy transport, Prestongrange, by Prestonpans, was the first major pit in the s.With the help of a beam engine from Cornwall, it went deep in .A second pit with shafts under the Forth was sunk at Prestonlinks in . One shaft linked with a Fe colliery, making it possible to walk under the Forth.The  Tranent-Cockenzie Waggonway opened inland pits by connecting them with Cockenzie harbour. These developed into Fleetsand Limeylandscollieries.These were linked, along with Carberryand Tynemount , to the North British Railway by the Garvald  Gford Railway.Wallyford, Whitecraig, Elphinstone, Ormiston and Macmerry all grew up to house miners working there.For - miners at each pit, working conditions were dreadful, being cramped, hot, dirty and dangerous.Mechanical diggers appeared around the time of the Second World War and pithead baths became universal only with the National Coal Boardin .The NCB dug new shallow mines like Wintonand Meadowmill , and the Monktonhall lsquosuperpitrsquo , but their future was short. All mines but Monktonhall were closed by .These forgotten mines offer more for our future than just Prestongrange Mining Museum.

In this monthly column, she shares her wildle diary ndash and pictures!THE day I first visited Musselburgh was not one to write home about.I came to town to see the house I had already agreed to move in to. Most people would organise a viewing before deciding to move in however, since it was my fianceacutersquos childhood home, I had simply said YES!Our move-in date was already confirmed, meaning this visit was just a formality.Upon seeing the amount of work the house still needed as it underwent considerable renovation, my initial reaction was one of utter petrication that it would not be completed on time.The weather was not particularly favourable either. Drenched in the cold September rain, I had lost my appetite to explore the area, which now seemed grim and gloomy.By contrast, my second visit to Musselburgh is one worth remembering.I had come to check on the progress of the house and to join a group of birdwatchers for a stroll around the Esk and the lagoons.The walk started at the river mouth, from where we watched a couple of cormorants sunbathing.It was not long before someone raised the cry: ldquoA kingfisher!I promptly directed my camera to where everyone was looking, and I saw him: a beautul, bright blue kingfisher.After that sighting I knew my le would change.Moving to Musselburgh ended up being one of the best decisions I have made .Since that day I have been studying this wee bird.Every spare moment is spent at the river watching for our kingfisher.It has become my all-encompassing obsession.Each encounter teaches me something new and I never stop learning.This one bird inspired me in many ways, such as helping me understand the importance of fieldcraft in wildle photography, and allowed for some unforgettable captures.So, without further ado, let me formally introduce Mr KingfisherhellipThe kingfisher is an unmistakeable bird, with its metallic azure blue back and bright orange breast.The bird is usually glimpsed, a sudden flash of glistening blue, flitting at the riverbank.If you are luckyenough, the bird may comfortably land near you.Usually, despite its exotic colouration, the bird is dficult to spot sitting on a branch surrounded by foliage, a kingfisher successfully blends into the landscape.I have spent hours in the field and can still struggle to spot a perching kingfisher.When I locate a bird, I identy the sex by the birdrsquos beak: the malersquos is completely black, whilst the femalersquos is orange underneath.Kingfishers are territorial and they will hold their ground against other iniduals.Breeding season is the only time when the male and female tolerate each other and share territory.The choice of feeding ground is extremely important as the bird is dependent on it all year round.Each area covers at least km of slow-flowing fresh water or lake, but this may extend anywhere up to km.The resident male I have been watching for almost three years exhibits slight migratory behaviour it travels upstream during the breeding season, whilst it spends the winter months near the river mouth. For its fishing ground, a kingfisher will often choose a shallow pool in the river bend.They are not titled ldquoking fishers for nothing and are experts in this field.Before ing, they sit patiently on a perch, bobbing their head back and forth to assess the exact position of a fish.Once it has spotted a fish, it es headfirst at speeds up to mph.The kingfisher enters the water with beak half open and eyes protected by its third, transparent eyelid.A split second later, the bird emerges, beak first, and flies back to the perch.Here, it twirls the fish so that it may be held by the tail, proceeding to bash it against the perch to kill it and break the spine, making it easier to swallow.If you have a favourite animal you would like me to feature next month, or are looking for advice on how to spot and photograph a kingfisher, contact me through my website or social media channels.

But the journey became more than I anticipated, and gave me a new angle on Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity.To reach the island I went on a cycle with my good friend Gareth. He is a keen cyclist, and in my early days I was too. I literally cycled hundreds of miles a week. It gave me freedom and a sense of adventure.Over the last couple of decades my cycling adventures have signicantly declined. Those long adventurous rides I used to go on, well they have been a thing of the past, especially after my beloved bike was stolen years ago.But then, during the lockdown, my wee daughter Skye decided she wanted to learn to cycle, and with gritty determination she did so, magically on the same path in the Greenhills at Prestonpans where I learnt so many years before.So another friend very kindly leant me a bike and I was able to accompany my daughter around the then quiet streets of our town as she developed her confidence.I enjoyed this, and it was good exercise, but it began to give me itchy feet and a nostalgic longing to re-experience some of the joys of my youth and head off onto the open road and go exploring on two wheels under my own steam.So when Gareth suggested we go for a ldquovery short cycle ride to visit Green Craig island that I had heard so much about, I gladly accepted.The destination was just beyond the big gates of Gosford House in total just under five miles away. And, of course, the road follows the coast, so no horrible hills to climb.So I set off, with my children waving at me asI was going to war, and met Gareth outside Cockenzie House as arranged.It was from here I became increasingly aware of the depreciation my body has suffered since my last long cycle.The road was, as far as I could ascertain, flat.There was a very slight breeze on my face to cool me, so in theory it was perfect cycling conditions.But something was wrong I was very quickly puffing and panting as I tried to keep up with my friend, who was coasting effortlessly in front of me.I could feel my face turning red and an old lady walking her small dog looked up and gave me a sympathetic glance as I passed her.I was cycling faster than she was walking but not by much.Then another cyclist passed me, at what seemed to be close to the speed of light, at least compared to the pathetic speed I was travelling.It was at this moment I noticed Gareth was well ahead of me, and talking to himself, as he believed I was still just behind him.So I called out, ldquoGareth, slow down a wee bit! He waited for me to catch up.ldquoSorry, I said, ldquofeel free to cycle ahead but I will have to go slower.ldquoYou want to go ahead  he asked.ldquoNo, I said, ldquo we do that we may be in danger of falling over due to lack of velocity!And so we headed out of town.My comment about velocity had put me in mind of Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity that speed is not absolute and objects move at a speed relative to one another, and that this affects the passage of time.My time was most certainly being slowed down. Never had that short journey felt so long.I discovered small hills I had driven over but never noticed. I became acutely aware of the power of gravity, and I lost count of how many stops I needed before we finally arrived at our destination.But what elation when we did arrive: I was shocked on one hand at just how unfit I was, but on the other I had a sense of achievement.We locked our bikes and headed along the coast to the island. The tide was out which meant we could reach it without getting our feet wet.Gareth was keen to find a trig pole which he had discovered was on the wee island. It was used by early map makers but we didnrsquot find it.We sat on a log, and Gareth offered me a cup of tea from his flask. Hersquod bought an extra cup, and we sat there, two metres apart on an old log looking out to sea, talking. It was the best cup of tea I can remember in a long time.The island isnrsquot much in itself, more like a tuft of land or gloried sandbank, just beyond the coast.But itrsquos the location and what you can see from it which makes it special, both in terms of wildle and landscape. And history too is all around.The sea comes in fast at this point and it was soon moving in a pincer motion, enveloping the wee tuft of land to make it an island once again.Itrsquos that which perhaps excites the childhood imagination in us, beating the tide before being marooned or maybe being marooned could be the best bit!But we left just in time. The sea lapped at our feet as we walked past the huge concrete blocks from wartime and we discussed the goings on in the world.As we reached our bikes I noticed some dens made by previous visitors.Impressive constructions, showing perhaps that the lockdown for many of us has given us an opportunity to explore and discover our own area in ways perhaps we never did before.Then we set off home. The journey back gave me a new phenomena to contemplate that a road can feel uphill both ways when you are an unfit, overweight man on a bicycle.Gareth insisted on cycling with me all the way home, you know, just in case.But I made it, and got a kind reception from my kids who asked me, ldquoWhere have you been all this time, you must have gone really far Well in one way I had. Not in terms of actual physical distance perhaps, but certainly in terms of having an unexpected and unforgettable adventure with a kind and understanding friend."},{"url":null,"title":"former-mens-club-become-four-flats","story":"East Lothian Council has given the green light to East Lothian Propertyrsquos plans to transform  Sidegate.The former Haddington Recreation Club closed its doors in the early s and will now become home to a ground-floor office and four flats.The three-storey property is currently used as bedsit accommodation.One member of the public objected to the proposals on grounds including road safety, the likelihood that ldquothe use of the building to accommodate an office and four flats will lead to a large number of cars parking on street at this potentially dangerous spot and that the proposals ldquodo not accommodate any dedicated off-street parking, the consequence of which would result in cars being parked on the narrow road outside the building which would result in dficulties for other road users and would create a road safety hazard.Despite the objections, the plans were given the go ahead, with the planning officer noting that colleagues in the roads services department raised ldquono objection to the plans.Billiards, draughts and table tennis were all played by male members of Haddington Recreation Club before it closed.

we knew that losing your sense of smellwas a signicant symptom of the disease.Now, after months of reports, both anecdotal and more rigorous clinical findings, we think we have a model for how this virus may cause smell loss.One of the most common causes of smell loss is a viral infection, such as the common cold, sinus or other upper respiratory tract infections.Those coronaviruses that donrsquot cause deadly diseases, such as COVID-, Sars and Mers, are one of the causes of the common cold and have been known to cause smell loss.In most of these cases, sense of smell s when symptoms clear, as smell loss is simply the result of a blocked nose, which prevents aroma molecules reaching olfactory receptors in the nose. In some cases, smell loss can persist for months and years.For the novel coronavirus , however, the pattern of smell loss is dferent. Many people with COVID- reported a sudden loss of sense of smell and then a sudden and fullto a normal sense of smell in a week or two.Interestingly, many of these people said their nose was clear, so smell loss cannot be attributed to a blocked nose.For others, smell loss was prolonged and several weeks later they still had no sense of smell. Any theory of anosmia in COVID- has to account for both of these patterns.This suddenof a normal sense of smell suggests an obstructive smell loss in which the aroma molecules cannot reach the receptors in the nose .Now that we have CT scans of the noses and sinuses of people with COVID- smell loss, we can see that the part of the nose that does the smelling, the olfactory cleft, is blocked with swollen soft tissue and mucus ndash known as a cleft syndrome.The rest of the nose and sinuses look normal and patients have no problem breathing through their nose.We know that the way SARS-CoV- infects the body is by attaching to ACE receptors on the surface of cells that line the upper respiratory tract.A protein called TMPRSS then helps the virus invade the cell. Once inside the cell, the virus can replicate, triggering the immune systemrsquos inflammatory response. This is the starting point for the havoc and destruction that this virus causes once in the body.Initially, we thought that the virus might be infecting and destroying the olfactory neurons.These are the cells that transmit the signal from the aroma molecule in your nose to the area in the brain where these signals get interpreted as ldquosmell.However, an international collaboration showed recently that the ACE proteins the virus needs to invade the cells were not found on the olfactory neurons.But they were found on cells called ldquosustentacular cells, which support the olfactory neurons.We expect that these support cells are likely to be the ones that are damaged by the virus, and the immune response would cause swelling of the area but leave the olfactory neurons intact.When the immune system has dealt with the virus, the swelling subsides and the aroma molecules have a clear route to their undamaged receptors and the sense of smell s to normal.So why does smell notin some cases This is more theoretical but follows from what we know about inflammation in other systems.Inflammation is the bodyrsquos response to damage and results in the release of chemicals that destroy the tissues involved.When this inflammation is severe, other nearby cells start to be damaged or destroyed by this ldquosplash damage. We believe that accounts for the second stage, where the olfactory neurons are damaged.Recovery of smell is much slower because the olfactory neurons need time to regenerate from the supply of stem cells within the lining of the nose.Initial recovery is often associated with distortion of the sense of smell known as parosmia, where things donrsquot smell like they used to.For many parosmics, for instance, the smell of coffee is often described as burnt, chemical, dirty and reminiscent of sewage.Physiotherapy for the noseOlfaction has been called the Cinderella of the senses because of its neglect by scientic research.But it has come to the forefront in this pandemic. The silver lining is that we will learn a lot about how viruses are involved in smell loss from this. But what hope is there for people with a loss of smell now The good news is that the olfactory neurons can regenerate. Theyrsquore regrowing in almost all of us, all of the time. We can harness that regeneration and guide it with ldquophysiotherapy for the nose: smell training."},{"url":null,"title":"headteacher-praised-leadership-style","story":"North Berwick High Schools head Lauren Rodgerwas described by Education Scotland inspectors as having a clear direction and being well respected.However while the inspection, carried out in February,praised the staff and leadership at the school and achievements of its senior students, it pointed to improvements required to enable more S-S pupils to learn a foreign language.The report called for more work to be done to ensure all younger students received their full entitlement to Broad General Educationin the first three years at the school.In particular it stated: \"Currently, a few young people are not experiencing a modern language until the end of S.\"Inaddition, the current arrangement is not sufficient for young people to receive their entitlementto a meaningful experience of a third language.\"Inspectors urged the school to ensure the focus was on ensuring younger pupils received full access to experiences across the curriculum and did not allow a focus on reaching exam levels to impact on them.The inspectors said: \"Teachers should ensure that learning at Sacross all curriculum areas remains focused on the experiences and outcomes of CfEanddoes not prioritise the requirements of National Qualications .\"Senior and middle leadersshould ensure that learning experiences in S provide those young people specialising atfourth level with appropriate depth in their learning to provide successful progression to thesenior phase.\"Inspectors visited the school in February  and assessed the schoolrsquos performance across four key indicators: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment raising attainment and achievement and ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.The school was evaluated as lsquovery goodrsquo in the first three categories and lsquogoodrsquo in the fourth.Headteacher Lauren Rodgerrsquos leadership style was described as ldquocharacterised by openness and by trust, promoting empowerment in a supportive ethos.

Everything, intellectually, is up for grabs. Changes in thinking ndash which before would have taken years, even generations ndash now happen almost overnight.Just a few days ago, for instance, I was taken aback by the boldness of thought which came from one of Scotlandrsquos leading economists, Professor Ronald MacDonald.MacDonald and I spoke about what can only be described as his revolutionary vision for a post-Covid economy. I wrote about his ideas in our sister paper, The Herald on Sunday, at the weekend. To put it mildly, MacDonald wants to completely reimagine capitalism ndash to recalibrate how we live so the world becomes a fairer, safer, saner place.MacDonald isnrsquot just a big brain at home here in Scotland and Britain ndash hersquos among the leading % of economists in the world. When he speaks, others really should listen. Nor is MacDonald a natural radical. In Scotland, hersquos probably best known for pouring economic cold water on the case for independence.In person, hersquos mild-mannered, avuncular and charming. This isnrsquot a rebel by any stretch of the imagination. But what he says is truly rebellious ndash at least from the point of view of those who control the levers of power when it comes to politics and finance.Self-evidently, it says a lot about our world that the term \"revolutionary\" should ever be applied to ideas that champion decency and fairness. But then inequality and a brutal social darwinism are the hallmarks of the society in which we currently live.MacDonald is simply saying what a lot of ordinary folk will see as common sense. The only dference is that unlike many of us, MacDonald can back up his common sense worldview with a letime of knowledge and study. Intellectually, hersquod be a dficult man to shout down at any time but the world we live in today makes any attack on his ideas seem dull, lazy, stagnant. Yesterdayrsquos thinking.The ideas that MacDonald is putting forward would have been dismissed just a few months ago as crazy by the middle-brow commentariat and political class whorsquove spent their cosy careers singing hymns to unfettered free market capitalism. Our think-tanks and political parties are populated by a courtier class of hired hacks and group-thinkers whose intellectual horizons go no further than the tips of their noses.Now, though, in this post-Covid world, real thinkers can look at the world and see that not only is the time ripe for change, and ripe for debate about change, but also ordinary people are desperate for change, they want to hear big ideas that will make their lives better.I see the central message of MacDonaldrsquos call for change as this: a sht from shareholder capitalism to stakeholder capitalism. In other words, itrsquos not those distant shareholders who only call the shots, itrsquos you too. How many jobs have been lost, and lives squeezed, in recent years following the  financial crash, because shareholders wanted to wring more money for themselves out of the companies we work for. The idea that an ordinary worker can be thrown on the scrapheap because an absentee shareholder wants more money, more luxury, more \"stuff\", is so audaciously brazen, itrsquos almost criminal.So at heart, MacDonald simply wants to recalibrate the economy so itrsquos fairer for all. He proposes a wealth tax on the super-rich, and also a land tax. His plans donrsquot fundamentally threaten business or entrepreneurs. Theyrsquore needed to invest and help rebuild the economy post-Covid. In fact, he suggests making le easier by providing grants rather than loans to small and medium-sized companies.Another intellectual pillar of MacDonaldrsquos vision is that GDP should no longer be the sole measure of a nationrsquos success. We need to measure ourselves not by wealth alone, but by health, social care, the environment and the quality of citizenrsquos lives.Isnrsquot this the essence of decency  Isnrsquot this the kind of ideas our grandmothers instilled in us when we were all young  That money doesnrsquot buy you happiness. That you donrsquot measure a person by whatrsquos in their pocket but in their soul.MacDonald wants ldquoa new form of social contract where government instigates a ldquowellbeing fiscal stimulus. There can be no more austerity. Social capital is as important as capital. Happy, community-minded people who trust each other and their government will be productive wealth-creating citizens.Key to managing this change is the greening of the economy. If we replace our old dying oil industries with new green energy utilities,we start building and retro-fitting green homes and factories, we will create jobs and wealth, and help keep climate disaster at bay.Irsquom simply giving you the headline bullet points from MacDonaldrsquos new study on changing the economy. It makes for compelling, convincing, and necessary reading.But will it lead to anything  Will those in power listen to him, or is MacDonald a wise man shouting at the storm There is hope. The First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated in the past that she has the bravery of thought to also imagine a new form of economics. Earlier this year, before the pandemic, she said that it was ldquomorally indefensible to focus purely on growth as the measure of a nationrsquos success. Sturgeon also backs a Universal Basic Income although, some fear that rather than lting people out of poverty, UBI could institutionalise poverty.What matters is that Sturgeon has an open mind to economic change. If we cast our eyes around the world, there are few leaders of similar inclination.The ingredients for change are all there. We are facing financial ruin in the face of coronavirus, with devastation worse than . God knows where that leads us in such a ided and fraught era. So we have to act. An economist of great standing has written a roadmap for change. A leader is in office who has the intelligence to see that change is needed. Most importantly, the people want change, and we want it now.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

This was a logical result of the requirement by the government of clan chiefs sons to be educated in England or the Lowlands. It was the inevitability of insisting these Scots be forced to enter schools which to this day are the production line to leadership in government and the military. Hoist by your own petard comes to mind.It is an obvious fact that history is written by the victors. I would suggest thatmore Scots actually knew their history there would be a much greater feeling of anger aimed at the Parliament in Westminster. Of course we were involved in the slave trade, but so were the African chiefs who sold their countrymen to the slavers and the plantation owners, many of whom were freed slaves in later days. Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Vikings and Moors all have history of slavery and Brazil only banned slavery in . I am not being deafened by their apologies.If you throw a stone into the wake of a boat it will alter the pattern of the waves in some way but it will not affect where the boat is going. It is the same with history. If you are willing to learn from it you can better move forward, but changing street names and pulling down statues benefits the future not one iota. I would suggest to Mr Smith that he should worry far more for the future of his unionist ideologyScots do give up victimhood, as the next logical emotion is anger.David Stubley, Prestwick.I AGREE with Mark Smith that Scots need to face up to their history, good and bad, but when I was at school I studied history for five years and the curriculum contained not one iota of Scottish history what I got was Henry VIII and his marital woes, the Battle of the Nile, the League of Nations and the Russian Revolution. I note that in his cherry picking of bits of Scottish history, Mr Smith has made no mention of the  Act of Union, when Scots rioted in the streets because their nationhood had been signed away, and the Speaker of the House of Commons declared \"We have catchd Scotland and we will bind her fast\".The past should serve as a lesson to the present, although that is a lesson which seldom seems to be learned sadly, the war to end war didnt, and in the st century UK foreign policy would appear to have learned nothing from past centuries, involving itself in foreign wars including an unwinnable war in Afghanistan, and to the UKs eternal shame, the illegal invasion and bombing of Iraq. Carl Sagan wisely said: \"You have to know the past to understand the present,\" and many would dismiss Henry Fords comment that \"history is more or less bunk\". But he went on to observe: \"It is tradition. We dont want tradition. We want to live in the present and the only history that is worth a tinkers dam is the history we make today.\" In making todays history, how we deal with present issues, many of which are rooted in the past, will determine our future and the future of generations to come that is what should concern us most of all.Ruth Marr, Stirling.NOT that long ago the Scots actor David Hayman narrated an excellent BBC documentary on this countrys involvement in the slave trade entitled Scotlands Shame. The essence of the programme was that it related actual and authentic history, highlighting how the trade in human beings impacted every aspect of Scotlands economic, social and cultural le. In doing so it broke with the Great Man or Great Inidual view of history which so often trivialises serious history. The same approach has been adopted by Professor Sir Tom Devine.This authentic appraisal of the nations past is not an easy debate to have and it is important that it is conducted as objectively as possible. It is, however, related to another aspect of Scotlands history and one that remains important for many peoples view of their Scottish identity. When I was younger I, in common with millions of other Scots, listened uncritically to the song a Scottish Soldier. This relates the story of the Scot who soldiers far away and fights in many a fray. If I listened to the same song today I would do so much less uncritically and would be inclined to consider the origins of the Martial Scot.History is an interesting area of study but it is also something we can learn and progress from. After all, we dont need to go back to Britains imperial past to find examples of pointless, avoidable wars.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.MARK Smithrsquos article on how we view our history is interesting and perceptive, but may I take him up on one point . We talk, he says, ldquoabout our lonely imprisoned queens and not our brutal warrior kings. The sole member of the former set is easily identiable but whom has he in mind for the latter War is brutal anda king, whose supreme obligation is to protect his people, is faced with the choice of seeing his country overrun by a brute and adopting brutal means to prevent it, as was true ofRobert Bruce, then there is no choice at all.

Had he done so he might well have ed alive, with much of his army, to continue his energetic rule over a prosperous and outward-looking European power ndash instead of, by chivalrously withdrawing from his strong position and allowing the English an orderly muster, dying in the course of a catastrophic defeat and leaving his realm to years of near-chaos under his infant heir.It is certainly true that Scotland played its full part in the discreditable history of British imperialism but prior to the Union, there is no question which of the two kingdoms on the island had the worse record as an aggressor power.Derrick McClure, Aberdeen AB."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11462194.jpg?type=article-full","title":"nine-hours-week-class-pupils-scotlands-best-performing-schools","story":"Letters sent to parents of schools overseen by East Dunbartonshire Council show that secondary schools will only be able to accommodate nine pupils in every classroom - drastically cutting the amount of in-class time children will have.And primary schoolpupils will be in-school for two days a week, with home learning for two days as long as the two-metre social distancing rule to stop the spread of Covid- is in place.:Two thirds of Scots parents complain about having no online lessons from schools during lockdownIt comes as education secretary John Swinney prepares to make a statement on Tuesday at Holyrood on the next steps towards reopening schools.Pupils are due tofromAugust , but will initially have a \"blended\" approach involving face-to-face teaching and at-home learning.There has been speculationexams in  could be delayedand that blended learning could last for a year.TheHerald revealed the concerns of parents over future plans for childrens school as new analysis revealed two thirds of parents complained their school was not providing online lessons during the coronavirus lockdown.A parent poll raised concerns about a lack of face-to-face school time off the back of the Scottish Governments controversial blended learning plans when schools open again in August.East Dunbartonshire Council which looks after top performing secondary schools such as Douglas Academy, Bearsden Academy, Lenzie Academy, St Ninians High and Bishopbriggs Academy revealed its back to school information in a letter from chief education officer Jacqui MacDonald.She said that after an extensive exercise to assess the capacity of each secondary school, it was confirmed a maximum of nine pupils could be accommodated in each classroom of most schools.Following consultation with head teachers and unions, it was decided that all secondary schools in the council area would plan for one third of the year group attending at any one time - equating to nine hours in-class for each pupil.For primary school pupils this meant two-days, or  hours of in-school provision operating on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.\"\"We understand that it is a very dficult time for parents, particularly those who need toto work, as children will not be in school full time,\" said the education chief, saying the focus was on \"health and well-being\".She added: \"We are working to put in place additional childcare for the children of key workers.

The people of Scotland will not accept a go-slow approach from Nicola Sturgeon much longer.It came as the Prime Minister set out his mass unlocking plan for England, which will see pubs and restaurants reopen and allow customers inside and outdoors from next weekend.Hair salons, wildle parks, hotels and holiday homes will be able to open, provided they have created a Covid secure environment.: Swinney in colossal U-turn on school re-openingsMeasures could include putting up screens, having staff wear PPE, increasing ventilation, providing hand sanitiser and creating one-way systems through exhibits and shops.Crucially, Mr Johnson has also cut the two-metre social distancing rule to \"one metre plus\", which he described as \"one metre apart while taking mitigations to reduce the risk\". These include reducing the amount of time spent indoors with other people and wearing a mask on public transport.Two households of any size will also be allowed to meet up indoors under the plans, though they cannot hug.Conservative MP John Lamont said his constituents in Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, would \"not get the benefits\" of the PMs measures \"as the First Minister of Scotland is delaying Scotlands release from lockdown.\"Alister Jack, Secretary of State for Scotland added that Scotland \"must also start looking at how to open our economy safely.\"He said: \"Given the signicant fall in the incidence of the disease, and following the review from our scientic experts, the UK Government has taken cautious steps forward.\"I would urge the Scottish Government to also act quickly and decisively to help Scottish businesses get back on their feet.Nail bars, beauty salons, spas, nightclubs, indoor play areas, and tattoo parlours will remain closed in England, but places of worship will be allowed to hold services from July  - though singing, thought to increase risk of transmission, will be banned.Weddings with up to  people will be permitted, and customers to pubs and restaurants will be asked to leave their contact details in case the venue is subsequently linked to a positive case.Meanwhile Health Secretary Jeane Freeman confirmed that from July  all hospital staff working in specialist cancer units, long-stay mental health wards, and long-term care of the elderly wards would be routinely tested for Covid once a week as part of measures to limit transmission of Covid as NHS services are stepped up.Medical and adult care home staff who are in contact with patients or residents will be required to wear medical-grade face masks from Monday. Visitors and patients attending hospital for outpatient or day case procedures will also be required to wear face coverings.\"This new measure is designed to reduce the risk of transmission from the person wearing the mask or face covering,\" said Ms Freeman."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-economy-take-four-years-reach-new-normal-covid","story":"The Fraser of Allander Institute said Scotland was now in its ldquodeepest recession in living memory and the outlook was ldquohugely challenging.In its latest economic commentary, the Institute said that even under its ldquooptimistic scenario of continued Covid decline and an economic upturn, the economy would notto pre-pandemic levels until late  or early .Howeverthe crisis dragged on, and especiallythere was a second wave of infections and ato lockdown, it would be the biggest hit to livelihoods in a generation.:The revolutionary new vision for a post-Covid Scottish economyldquoWe estimate that this could mean the economy does not get back to pre-crisis levels until mid-, the Strathclyde University outfit said.The Institute said that, while the  per cent collapse in Scottish GDP since the outbreak was ldquolargely articial and entirely due to the lockdown, it would alter the countryrsquos business base forever.Director Professor Graeme Roy said: ldquoThe near % drop in economic activity in April for Scotland highlights the scale of the economic crisis that we face.ldquoSo far, as a result of the major government support initiatives that have been put in place ndash including around , employees furloughed or supported through the self-employment scheme ndash the impact of the full effects of the crisis have been dampened.ldquoSadly, it is only now once we start to switch the economy back on that the crisis will hit home with a raft of redundancies and business closures likely over the summer.ldquoIn looking to the future, there is one important take-away from all this.

Gillebride MacMillan, head of subject for Celtic and Gaelic studies at Glasgow University, said the LearnGaelic data highlighted both an underlying increase in interest and the extent to which technology has been helping this grow further.ldquoOverall itrsquos a really positive time for Gaelic at the moment, he said.ldquoItrsquos very hard to create spaces where Gaelic is heard and spoken and, when so many things started going online, there was a worry that Gaelic would be swallowed up in the English-dominated world of the web.ldquoBut, with the lockdown, so many people have been going online - singing or organising virtual ceilidhs - and, as well as that, the web has really opened up opportunities for Gaelic learning and going deeper into the process of learning the language.ldquoThere are now numerous Gaelic Zoom and Skype classes all over the world.ldquoI used to teach classes to students in the USA and we had students in Colorado, Florida, Michigan and so on. They were very disparate but, thanks to technology, they had created their own online community.ldquoA new Gaelic immersion course is also starting at the university where people can learn Gaelic through immersion in Glasgow for the first time.Mr MacMillan said the role of the Scottish Parliament in ldquonormalising and boosting the languagersquos profile had been crucial.ldquoItrsquos now  years since the Gaelic Language Act was put in place and this is a good time to see the changes that have come about, he explained.ldquoI remember being a student in Gaelic  years ago and remembering how important the first ever debate in Gaelic in the Scottish Parliament was.ldquoAnd now we take it for granted that the Finance Secretary [Kate Forbes] is a Gaelic speaker and has addressed the Parliament in Gaelic.ldquoWhen therersquos a political will - and with Gaelic we have been fortunate to have had cross-party political support - that gives a sense of authority that we do have a right to speak the language, and learn it through Gaelic medium education, and that we can fight for that right.ldquoThe Gaelic Language Act was important in that it provides that authority for Gaelic speakers and those interested in it to really go for they want to do.Mr MacMillan admitted the language still faced formidable challenges, particularly in some of its heartlands in the Outer Hebrides. But he said the figures from LearnGaelic were a sign of better times ahead, both in Scotland and internationally.ldquoThanks to shows such as Outlander, millions and millions of people all over the world are seeing Gaelic on their screens, he added.ldquoMany people have written to me to say that, previously, they werenrsquot aware of it but had become interested.ldquoItrsquos very much about normalising the language - making it a normal, everyday language.For Nicky MacCrimmon, taking online lessons through LearnGaelic was a way of connecting with his own past.The -year-old from Dundee spoke the language a little as a toddler thanks to his time at a Gaelic nursery.But he then forgot it after attending English-speaking schools.A keen hillwalker, Mr MacCrimmon wanted to learn how to pronounce Gaelic mountain names.It was when he was looking for online learning resources that he stumbled across the LearnGaelic website.ldquoI use a lot of the childrenrsquos resources because itrsquos colourful and full of cartoons and gives you a brilliant basic introduction, which is just what you need as a learner, he said.Mr MacCrimmon has just finished a Gaelic language course, An Cugraversa Adhartais, at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, University of the Highlands and Islands, as a distance learning student.He has joined a group of people from Perthshire who are also learning and they meet every few months to speak Gaelic in a social setting.ldquoCombining my academic studies with LearnGaelic has made it much more fun and informal and kept me motivated, he said.Eilidh Lewsey, Editor at LearnGaelic, which is a partnership between MG ALBA, Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig, the BBC, Bograverd na Ceiltisand Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, welcomed the latest figures.ldquoWersquove seen the strongest growth in our beginnersrsquo resources such as our Gaelic Sounds pages and Fichead Facal , she said.ldquoAn Litir Bheag , a short letter aimed at learners, is fully integrated with our dictionary and has also enjoyed a momentous growth.

Our aim is to reinvigorate this craft ndash to teach people about its history and encourage others to take it up.The pair will specialise in  types of side and armchair, plus three types of rocking chair, each one learned from Lawrence and with its own particular story and origins.However they intend to innovate, not least by experimenting with woods such as sycamore and beech that are prolic in Scotland and also hope to put an emphasis of sustainability.Rush seated ladder back chairs were popular with the Arts and Crafts movement because they embodied its values of fine traditional craft making, inspired by nature and offering practicality, simplicity and beauty.Now synonymous with the architecture and art of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, the Scottish Arts and Crafts movement of the s left a lasting legacy.Mackintosh himself was inspired by William Morris and John Ruskin, the architects of the aesthetic movement that influenced designers and artists on both sides of the Atlantic which came to le as an act of reform in reaction to the mechanisation of the industrial revolution.Mr Cooper, , a former scuba ing instructor who has loved carpentry since school, was working for a logistics company in London when the apprenticeship opportunity came up.He said: ldquoI used to skip other lessons to spend all the time in the tech lab doing woodwork and have been doing it as a hobby ever since.ldquoI really wanted to find a way to turn it into a career ndash so when this came up it was a dream come true.Both appreciate the idea that the furniture they make will be cherished for generations and will find places around dining tables and in living rooms in every kind of home.They already have orders from across the UK including Truro and Edinburgh and have been shortlisted for the  Heritage Craft Association Trainee of the Year award.The apprenticeships and workshop were set up by Hugo Burge, Marchmontrsquos director, who has restored the mansion near Greenlaw, with his father Oliver Burge, with the idea of making it a home for artists and makers.He has a personal love of the rush seated ladder back chairs, dating from his days at Bedales School where the library is furnished with them.He said: ldquoMany of the great names of the Arts and Crafts movement and British design created their own version of rush seat chair ndash including Mackintosh, Lutyens, Voysey, Morris, Heal and Russell.ldquoThey are a truly important part of our craft history.ldquoWhen I discovered that Lawrence Neal was planning to retire and had no successors I thought it would be a tragedythis understated craft,with such a long history, was to belost.Marchmont House already has a collection of around  antique rush seat ladder back chairs.The new venture means it is playing a role in the future of the craft as well as preserving its past.A series of estate buildings are being refurbished to create seven units for artists and makers, with the Marchmont Workshop being the first to open.Mr Neal said: ldquoI always hoped this craft would have a le beyond me, that there would be someone to take up the torch and carry on the trade.ldquoIf this was lost we would be losing part of our heritage."},{"url":null,"title":"lift-off-recommended-first-virtual-spaceport-sutherland","story":"PLANNERS have recommended that the UKrsquos first vertical launch spaceport is given lt off.Highlands and Islands Enterprisewants to build the controversial pound.m satellite launch site on peatland on the Moine Peninsula near Tongue in Sutherland.Council officials have said launches should be limited to  per year.Among the reasons for this is the amount of plastic and metal debris falling into the sea during rocket launches.Twelve would see an estimated five tonnes of carbon fibre reinforced plastic and seven tonnes of metal alloy dropping into the sea each year, according to the officialsrsquo report.Councillors on Highland Councilrsquos north planning applications committee will consider the proposals for Space Hub Sutherland on Friday.The planning officerrsquos report -

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

The four new directors, who have now been co-opted onto our board, bring a range of valuable skills and experience to the table and we very much look forward to working with them during these critical months ahead. “Having a strong board presence, which is fully representative of the trade, is essential as we develop recovery plans with local partners, agencies and regional and national governments.”Orkney’s tourism industry, worth over £ million a year to the islands’ economy, has been hard hit by the COVID- crisis.During the pandemic, Destination Orkney Ltd has been keeping its members up to date with information on COVID- support and available funding streams, offering guidance, and lobbying locally and nationally, while sharing updates from the Scottish Tourism Alliance, Scottish Government, VisitScotland and other national bodies.In order to develop COVID- Orkney recovery plans with partners, Destination Orkney Ltd has also established an industry recovery group to discuss matters such as reopening, communication and marketing, as well as identying future resource and investment needs and opportunities. copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Employers should support their workers in using face coverings safely and provide advice,requested, on applying and removing the covering.On ferry services face coverings must also be worn by passengers and staff unless the ferry, or part of the ferry which is open to members of the public, is entirely outdoors or physical distancing of two metres can be maintained.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson stressed the importance of the new rules and that by wearing a face covering everyone is engaged in a collective responsibility to reduce the risk of transmission.He said: “Our message remains clear that public transport should be for key workers and those who need it most and can’t walk or cycle to work.#Capacity is reduced to enable physical distancing and operators are not yet running full services. However, as we work towards recovery and more peopleto work and further local leisure opportunities begin to open up it is vital that measures are put in place to protect everyone’s health.“Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens. These measures complement physical distancing and good hand hygiene, they do not replace them.”Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website.

It is important that we face our fears and do not avoid them.“The enjoyment we might get from moving more freely outside, travelling and meeting friends and family is tempered when we are worried about the spread of infection. By sticking to the rules during the gradual lting of restrictions, we can be confident that risk won’t rise. Less virus around us can be matched with less restriction.“Although there are practical things we can do to help ourselves cope over the coming weeks, remember that help is availableneeded.  We’ve never had to deal with a situation like this before, so be kind to yourself and to others, and reach outyou need to talk to someone.  Support is there.”For practical tips, you can visit clearyourhead.scot.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If itrsquos signicantly busier than we expect, wersquove got to be ready for that too.

This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed at a volume that makes normal conversation dficult.This is because as people start shouting or speaking up they are more likely to launch the virus into the air and spread it to other customers ndash so-called aerosol transmission. vw,vw,px, px\"Pubs and restaurants will also be asked to get their customers to order food directly to their tables using a smartphone app, where possible.Another casualty of the coronavirus restrictions is likely to be the bottle of vinegar or jar of mayonnaise, as the Government encourages businesses to replace these with disposable alternatives.And gone are the days of picking up your own knives and forks at the counter.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

I agree there is no place for racism anywhere in the UK or around the world! But the #BLM# movement has all the characteristics of a trending cult!..fortunately we do not live in a racist country but there are racists who live here. I really struggle to understand why people would support a movement that activity supports the idea of white shame. According to these peoplebeing white is a bad thing!, that sounds a little racist to me. All i would say is that modern day slavery is still rampant in the world and the criminals who run these things don#t care what skin colour you have. This is what BLM should be protesting, becauseall le matters!..Fun fact..The only #BAME# person to be killed by uk police in the past  months was the London bridge terrorist attacker!The moment you see people using words like #virtue signalling# and #woke#, the more you can be sure they have got their whole education from Facebook.Brian, You nailed it right there. The AHS ethos is no more.Modern day indentured servitude is still alive and operating today:on Shetland.It’s called Crofting. It was responsible for the clearancesin the th, th and early th century. It wasn’t until the Crofting Act of  that tenants were permitted to actually buy the land that they had worked for generations.George Winston#s final comment says it all.There is no fun involved. Normal standard of decency Perhaps The Shetland Times has let itself down by airing this man#s vile views on this occasion.Deaths in policy custody should not be regarded so trivially, not should the other ways in which people are discriminated against be sidelined.And Winston#s use of inverted comments on BAME signals distain, asthey are in doubt, such as in the following: The #anti-racist# George Winston reveals his prejudice in several ways. Continuing to work backwards, BLM doesn#t need to be protesting all le matters. For one, that is not contested . More importantly the lives of black people and people from Britain#s ethnic minorities are blighted by racism and are too often cut short because of racist violence and institutional and ingrained discrimination, as is sadly also the case in too many other countries.Quite where George gets off on saying #these people # hold #being white is a bad thing# is dog whistling two common racist tropes.There is no #these people# when it comes to those who want to stand up for a fairer world.The only #bad thing#evident is demonstrated amply by #anti-racist# George.George can claim to struggle all he likes to understand the issue of #white shame#, but there#s only one reason why he struggles.He seeks to lambast those with concerns about the nature of inequality in stC UK, as is evident from every sentence he hascontributed.His is hateful commentary.I ask the people on these marches where does the clothes and shoes you wear come from and how much do these workers get paid nobody caring about that and the rest of us have stayed home for months to stay safe and not infect others .

being in place and protective measures and risk assessments being carried out in schools”.For weeks teachers and other education staff have been preparing plans and helping to kit out classrooms to ready themselves for re-opening in August.They had done so in the expectation that school capacity would be limited, with two metre social distancing rules remaining in place.Many parents has expressed concerns about the impact of the continued lack of classroom time would have on their children.In Skye parents were told last week that due to the guidelines and school transport constraints many Portree High pupils would only be able to attend for one day a week.Councillor John Finlayson, Chair of the Highland Council’s Education Committee welcomed Mr Swinney’s announcement, but said more detailed guidance and information on new resources would be required.He said: “The announcement by the Deputy First Minister that the planning assumption will now be for a fullto school for all

people is extremely important in terms of their educational, mental and social development, as well as their future opportunities and outcomes.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our school staff and our parents and pupils for their hard work and collaboration throughout the period of lockdown and especially over recent weeks when they have been developing plans topupils to school taking account of the rules that are currently in place.“It has been a very dficult time in many ways for all.He added: “It should not be forgotten that a fullto education in August will only be possible with continued adherence to national guidance and scientic advice and everyone has played an important role in helping to suppress the virus in our community.“We cannot become complacent.”The Scottish teaching union called for “appropriate mitigations” to protect staff and pupils.EIS General Secretary, Larry Flanagan said: #This means looking at measures already being used where such as mandatory face coverings, protective perspex shields, proactive testing of teachers and an appropriate level of physical distancing between pupils and most certainly between pupils and staff, alongside continued protections for vulnerable groups.”Mr Swinney revealed that an additional £ million will be invested over the next two years to tackle the impact of lockdown on schools and pupils, including ensuring every current probationer teacher who meets the standard for full registration having a teaching post for the year ahead.Education Scotland has also agreed to work with E-Sgoil, the digital training  pioneered in the Western Isles, to develop a national e-learning provision for all senior phase pupils to access lessons online from qualied teachers.Mr Swinney said: “Since May, because of the efforts of ordinary people to stay at home, we have seen Scotland make signicant progress.“There are now only around  infectious people in Scotland – a reduction of around  per cent since May.“There has been a sustained downward trend in Covid- deaths since the end of -th April, and intensive care cases now stand at a fraction of what they were.“If we stay on track,we

its meter reading activities across Northern Ireland after the service was temporarily paused due to COVID- restrictions. While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice.

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

This should have been readjusted to the UK fit-testing requirements. We are advised that any risk to staff is likely to be low.The HSC system is now carrying out a validation and audit exercise of all fit-tests conducted by this independent contractor.The PHA has been asked by the Department of Health to undertake a serious adverse incident review.This is defined as any event or circumstance that led or could have led to serious unintended or unexpected harm, loss or damage to patients.They must be carried out after an incident resulting in serious harm, or an unexpected or unexplained death, for example.Incidents may include infection outbreaks in a hospital or the failure of equipment.Additional measures across the HSC will be put in place to review and monitor fit-testing outcomes moving forward, the PHA said. Staff impacted will be informed and offered support. Fit-testing will be carried out under the correct NI setting.We fully recognise that the issues raised may cause some concern and we very much regret that. We would again stress that these checks are being taken as a precautionary step to reassure staff that the masks are being fitted to the highest safety standards. Rigorous tried and tested procedures have been in place during the pandemic for staff to highlight any concernsthey feel their PPE equipment does not properly fit. Further information will be made public following the conclusion of the audit.Health union Unison had been advised last Thursday by health trusts of a regional alert in relation to PPE fit-testing carried out for trusts by an external company. It said it was told that some staff may have received a positive fit-test when, in actual fact, under HSE standards this may not have been the case. Unison regional secretary Patricia McKeown said last night her main concern is the extent to which our members have been exposed and what liability lies with employers and the department.I think there are more issues here than the calibration of machines. We raised concerns about nature of the masks, and the instruction at least one company gave to tie knots in them to make fit, she said.There was a major issue about masks being generally made to fit a larger male face, rather than a smaller female face - and the majority of staff are women.We will certainly be giving evidence to any inquiry being carried out.Belfast Most ReadBelfast home designed by Mater Hospital architect goes on market for £.mBelfast streets #renamed# as part of republican campaignCoronavirus Northern Ireland: One further death as First Minister Foster hints at social distancing changeMurdered Glenn Quinn#s final call for help: UDA victim phoned brother in dying momentsPolice say missing Noah Donohoemay have head injury after abandoning clothing ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I think it will work as long as people use their common sense.There#s a worry as well that children are falling behind with their work.Kate said her choice would be to start back full-time straight away.I#m not getting as much done at home and it would be good to get back to see my friends.Lola Elliott , from Dundonald, has just finished her final year at Brooklands Primary School early and is due to start at Bloomfield Collegiate.Her mother, Dawn Elliott , said she still has safety concerns, but recognised the importance of getting back to structured learning.To be honest, I don#t even know what any of the arrangements are as nothing has been confirmed, she said.Transport wise, I would be very concerned as she would take the Glider, so we#re going to have to drive her to and from school for now.But we don#t know anything, there#s talk about using small bubbles for classrooms, but we don#t know for sure yet.She added: If I could keep her at home forever, I would, but doing school work at home has been tough. We started off on the right foot and it just faded away, but everyone is dealing with things dferently. Lola loves it.Lola said she has enjoyed learning at home, but was thankful she got to say goodbye to her primary school classmates with a special online Assembly. While many students might relish the idea of an extended break from school, for Niamh Larkinand her dad Andrew Larkin , from Portadown, the chance tocan#t come soon enough.Niamh is about to enter her third year at St John the Baptist#s College and is hoping to do a GCSE early as part of a high achievers class.Andrew said: I think their education is going to suffer as things are. If they can go back safely then I would be happy. It#s hard to get them to learn in the house, they need structured education, but at a safe distance.I would like them to get back to five days with a teacher in the classroom using social distancing.Niamh agreed she had missed friends and was worried about falling behind in her studies.Colleen McCluskey , from Belfast, was out shopping with son Caolanand grandmother Maureen McStravick .Colleen said: My son is in pretty small classes, so I do feel happy for him to go back. The way I see it isthey can go to childcare, as both myself and my husband work full-time,that#s okay, it#s alright for them to go to school. On dealing with months of lockdown, she said: We have to say we#ve been looking on the positive side of it, it#s been lovely to have time with the children, eventhey are a bit annoying at times.Grandmother Maureen added: We#ve been told that children have a very low risk of passing on the virus, so I think they should be back in school. Teaching at home works for some people, but there#s a lot that it doesn#t suit.

Queen#s University was renamed #Mairead Farrell University Belfast# with signage erected across its prominent front gates after the former student and IRA volunteer, killed in Gibraltar on active service in .The streets surrounding Belfast City Hall including May Street and Donegall Square were renamed after three hunger strikers - Joe McDonnell, Bobby Sands and Kieran Doherty - who died in Long Kesh in . Group spokesperson Pol Torboid said that they had compiled a list of place names from across the city that they say featured prominent iniduals responsible for historic abuses in Ireland.He added: Belfast#s streets, littered with the poverty of its people, its homeless and jobless are also littered with the names of those whose attitude to Ireland was one of subjugation, and who, by force of arms, forced a political and economic system upon our people, which became the foundation for partition, and for the current economic struggles faced by the Irish people.These street names, monuments to those who delivered misery across our nation in one form or another, also serve as monuments to the political and economic system that they helped to build in Ireland.These street names, the symbols of oppression, hate and servitude, must be stripped away. They must be replaced with the names of those who sought to build a better Ireland, the names of those who fought against oppression, against hate and against servitude.They must be replaced with the names of heroes: of normal people. Not lords. Not kings or queens but rather those who weren#t the heirs to vast riches.Those whose only inheritance was that which they tried to carve out of a political system that railed against them.It is our inheritance as Republicans to end the oppression immortalised in these street names and statues.It is our duty to end colonialism, to end the normalisation of imperialism and, consequently, the political and economic system that maintains it.Belfast Most ReadBelfast home designed by Mater Hospital architect goes on market for £.mMurdered Glenn Quinn#s final call for help: UDA victim phoned brother in dying momentsBelfast streets #renamed# as part of republican campaignCoronavirus Northern Ireland: One further death as First Minister Foster hints at social distancing changeFury as Co Antrim flute band urged to withdraw parade application ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At one metre our restaurants, hotels and coffee shops are more viable.“We want our hospitality and tourism industries to be sustained and sustainable and we need to make sure the provision is there for them to do that, of course in a way that is safe.”Yesterday Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that social distancing guidance in England could be reduced to m instead of m.However,social distancing at m the guidance is for other mitigating measures to be taken - such as face coverings and not working face to face.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

From  July, people who are shielding will be able to meet up to sixpeople outside the home, as long as social distancing is strictly observed. In addition, people who are shielding and living alone will be able to form a support bubble from July  with one other household. These easements are based on the continuing reduction in the rate of community transmission of the virus in Northern Ireland. Further details will be provided in writing to people who are shielding. This letter will also set out plans to put shielding on hold from  July. googletag.cmd.push Minister Swann said:“I have no doubt that shielding has played a key role in saving many lives. It has undoubtedly been extremely dficult for those who are shielding. I have listened with great sympathy to what people have told us about feeling isolated and how they have missed their loved ones. “I know these easements that take effect on  July will be welcome news to many as we move towards the pause in shielding from the end of July. “However, I am also very conscious that there will be some who are apprehensive about this change. I would therefore, once again, repeat my call to everyone to continue to observe social distancing and to be considerate of the fact that the people you meet may have been shielding for many weeks.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister added that people who are shielding must strictly follow public health advice on social distancing and hand washing. “While the risk of being infected has reduced, the virus still constitutes a serious threat to those who are shielding should they get it. “It is important to remember that because of your underlying condition, Covid- will remain a threat to you. At the same time, it is accepted that shielding has been really challenging and that being stuck indoors indefinitely is bad for mental and physical health. What we all have to do in these dficult times is try to strike the right balance. “This is about minimising any risk as much as possible, being aware that all contacts with the outside world must be managed really carefully. “Keep your distance, wash your hands, don’t touch your face, avoid touching hard surfacesyou are out. Wherever possible, avoid enclosed spaces where social distancing is hard to maintain – such as public transport and shops.” The easements in shielding guidance from  July were agreed at today’s Executive meeting. This includes meeting up to six people outside the home providing social distancing is strictly observed. People who are shielding alone can form a support bubble with one other household. Social distancing is not required with this other household. This will allow people to visit, stay over and spend more time with the second household. The second household can be of any size. Both households should not be part of more than one bubble and should continue to socially distance outside the bubble.

The RQIA – Northern Ireland’s health and social care regulator – was directed by the Department in March to reduce the frequency of its statutory inspection activity and cease its non-statutory inspection activity and review programme. This temporary measure was introduced to minimise the risk of health and social care professionals and other visitors spreading infection within care homes. Similar restrictions were introduced in GB and the Republic of Ireland. With community transmission of Covid- now signicantly reduced, the Department has been able to rescind the March direction. googletag.cmd.push With the rebuilding of health and social care services under way following the first wave of the Covid- pandemic, the RQIA will be able to increase its activity across all areas of work. It is important that this increased activity remains as safe and as flexible as possible. Returning to pre-pandemic inspection levels will not be immediately possible. Whilst RQIA’s planned inspection programme was temporarily paused, RQIA’s inspectors – including registered nurses, social workers and pharmacists – continued to regulate services and respond to risks and concerns. It reports that since the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic, it conducted around  on-site inspections at care homes and domiciliary care services. It has also taken enforcement action against five services during this time. googletag.cmd.push In recognition of the threat from Coronavirus to older and vulnerable people, the Department of Health also “repurposed” RQIA from March to provide enhanced support to care homes and domiciliary care services. In response, the regulator established a Service Support Team.This has involved RQIA inspectors and senior staff providing detailed advice and direction to care homes and domiciliary care services in managing their services during the pandemic period.

This is dferent. Last weeks edition of this column made two proposals for a new-look Derry senior football championship. Both were based around the inclusion of isional teams and in part two, we put some flesh on the bones. The thought process is the poorof players from the intermediate and junior grades coming through to the Derry senior football team in the last decade. Of  players used in league and championship, by five dferent managers, none hail from junior clubs and  from intermediate, one less than Ballinderrys club total. googletag.cmd.push Also, the decade saw Coleraine, Slaughtneil and Ballinderry dominate the competition. Its great for the clubs in question, but in a bid to help raise the quality overall. A county team needs more options. In Sideline Views proposal,  senior clubs have been selected on the basis of the last five years of the senior championship. The  teams who reached at least one semi-final were joined by Swatraghand Dungivenas the highest placed teams in the  league standings. The other three teams are isional teams picked from the rest of the clubs. Foyle Oaks , North Derry and South Derry. googletag.cmd.push Logistically it will be dficult to fit in around hurling. So in a case where Tiarnaacuten McHugh is trying to balance North Derry, Drumsurn and Kevin Lynchs, it will be far from ideal. A balance will be needed and proper dialogue between all three managers, with the players training regime at the heart of it. The senior championship will need to be played off over dferent weekends to intermediate and junior. This would be a stumbling block as it stands, with so much tied up in the leagues. Under this new concept, leagues would be totally dferent from championship. Leagues of  with a two up two down relegation, would be devised with one thing in mind – getting as many games as possible. The CCC would allocate rounds on the weekends the NFL is on. Club games are on Friday or Saturday night, with the county taking place on Sunday. The county manager names his starting  and anyone outside of that, who didnt see any meaningful game time in previous round, is eligible for club football. It would need checked with the county physio, buta player is going to be of any benefit, they need competition in the legs. The advantage is having more games on a more regular basis, with more room to balance the club championship commitments. It would help avoid loggerheads at a time of year when it really matters, it would help get rid of the alarming drop-off rate from players being caught between two stools. A situation where nobody wins and in the case of Derry, it leaves a situation that stles any continuity. ON THE DRAW Last week, Liam Tunneyrandomly picked  numbers and the draw was populated as you see below. It has some mouthwatering ties. North Derrys clash with a Dungiven side clambering their way back to their decline is the tie of the round, with the late Sunday night billing at Owenbeg. The appointment of former Dungiven manager Michael OKane and Darren McShane as managers of North Derry will add a bit of spice along the sideline. South Derrys debut in the championship see them up against a ravenous Slaughtneil, who have aim to win back the John McLaughlin Cup after a two year absence and have the astute Paul Bradley at the helm. In the opposition dugout is Ronan Rocks who will know the intermediate scene well and has an handle on the up and coming minor talent from his time with Derry Us. He is joined in the South Derry management team by Hugh Mulholland, who never misses a club championship game and will know Slaughtneil inside out. Foyle Oaks, under the management of Michael McLaughlin and Joe Gray, come up against Loup, with Paddy Bradley in his first season in charge. Lavey and Coleraine renew their  final rivalries.

At the end of the season, two from the first teams eliminated will meet in a play-off to stay in the senior championship. From the last five years, form will be assessed for wins, draws and defeats, as well as scoring totals to pick the two lowest performing teams, who will play in a relegation play-off.

Of their seven titles, Fergal Moore was involved in five, while Conrad McGuigan, their  winning captain, has six winners medals. Michael McMullan spoke to them about their memories. ***If you build it, they will come. The ghostly words inspired Ray Kinsella to build a field of dreams in the middle of his Iowa corn field in Kevin Costners  film of the same name. Craigbane also built for the future. A sharp left turn off the Slieveboy road and Gerry Crossan Park edges into view at the foot of Glenrandel brae. A state-of-the-art hall and gym. A fully floodlit pitch and one with training lights. A running track and a windmill spinning in the background. Its well used, worth every penny and the hours of planning. googletag.cmd.push Gavin Conwell, Ulster winning captain in , is the clubs Youth Officer and is passing on his knowledge to the next crop. Alfie Dallas, George Sharkey and Brian Conway also used the hall to the max. The future is in safe hands. Former senior manager Kevin Moore and Kieran McElhinney manage the minors. Ryan McDaid is involved with the Us. John Oacuteg Donaghy is Chairman. Former goalkeepers Paul McLaughlin and Gerard McLaughlin are on the committee. Its their turn to put a dferent stamp on the club. Next month, Craigbane will continue their rebuilding process in the unfamiliar surroundings of junior, almost  years since they were fingertips away from knocking Ballinderry out of the  Derry championship. The same season the Shamrocks ended as All-Ireland champions. googletag.cmd.push The last decade ravaged Craigbanes senior team of physicality and experience. Year by year, the youth has been thrown in. Now, theyre finding their feet. St Columbs Derry and Cathair Dhoire school teams have emerged with a Craigbane imprint. When St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy school team, under the guidance of current senior player Brian Rainey, there was also a strong Craigbane core.  Craigbanes  U championship winning team All coming from their U championship winning team of , when they beat a fancied Kilrea. “We, as a club, needed it,” manager Conrad McGuigan said after the game. “At the start of the year they beat us by  or  points, but I saw something in our boys in the second half – they didn’t lie down.” By September, they overturned the Pearses to land the silver. *** After early signs of football in the area during the s, St Josephs Craigbane wasnt founded until  and after a Division Three title, the  reserve success was their first championship. “We were starting to get to finals at that time,” Conrad McGuigan remembers of the beginning. “In , it was the th year of the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was our first final and we won it.” McGuigan, not yet , was beginning to cut his teeth in the senior team. After an appearance in the semi-final, he didnt play in the final against Loup. “The team included more of the older hands, it was a very settled team,” McGuigan outlines, before rattling off some of the names. “Noel Moore, Gerard McLaughlin, Shane Lynch, Harry Roe McLaughlin, Paddy Cartin, George Sharkey, Dermot Gormley and Damian OKane. “There were four Gormley brothers, Peter, God rest him, Colm, Leo and Brendan,” he adds. With the clash of green, Loup played in Ballinderry colours and Craigbane purchased a set of Down jersies for the game. “I also remember Loup taking home Martin OBrien from England for the game,” Conrad recalls. “He was a big player for them and that was the worry. Loup were favourites, but it worked out okay for us in the end.” With a first championship in the bag, McGuigan also hails Paul Dixon as being a huge influence on the team. He had ed from a stint with Burnley and was playing with Glentoran at the time. In , it took a replay to get over reigning junior champions Greenlough in the semi-final. Injury to Peter Gormley and his brother Colms sending off robbed them of their midfield pairing, remembers goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin. Gerry McElhinney came home from England to answer the call. Craigbane found themselves seven points down in the latter stages of the final to Claudy. Earlier in the game, Dixon missed a penalty and turned down the chance to take Craigbanes second penalty. Nobody  fancied it and up stepped McGuigan and his goal sparked their comeback.  The Craigbane team pictured before the  replay win over Claudy Still Claudy held the upper hand and it look a last throw of the dice, Conrad remembers. “There was about two minutes left and I put a ball into the square, it was more of a Hail Mary and hepunched it into the net. The goal earned a replay, which Craigbane won, - to - and retained their title, leading to a four-year stint in the senior championship. Away from the clubscene, McGuigan played in St Marys Belfasts  Sigerson Cup win over UCC. He was also playing with Derry Us and Tommy Diamond had called him into the senior , where he saw some initial action. While success followed his career path, so too did injury. If two leg breaks werent enough, a dislocated elbow and putting out his shoulder a few times added to the woe. *** Tyrone has played a central part in Fergal Moores le. As a corner forward, he played up front with Geoffrey McGonigle on the Derry minor team, beaten by the Red Hands at Omagh in . Married and living close to Errigal Ciarans home in Dunmoyle for the last  years, saw him faced with a  milejourney to train and play with Craigbane. Despite being approached by the Tyrone giants to transfer and the lure of senior championship football, he stuck with his roots. “We wouldve been training twice a week and maybe three times coming up to championship,” Moore outlines. “I was asked to joinbut I never really thought about it. If Craigbane didnt have a game, I would go and watch Errigal.” Loyalty to home club was too much, though he has helped coach his daughter Michealas ladies team. “I have been at Tyronegames, but I have just been shouting her name,” he jokes. “Youll not get me cheering come on Tyrone or anything like that.” After starting on the Craigbane senior team as an U in , it was  before he made his championship debut, coming on as a sub in the final against Magilligan. “It was easy enough in the finish,” he outlines of Craigbanes win. Through the minors, he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era. An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the s. “Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers. “A lot of the young boys in thephotographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as  senior captain. “Boys were saying I want to play with our senior team and it was a spur for the parish.” Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience. “The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley , Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace. At that stage, we wouldve given anybody in the county a good game for it,” McGuigan stresses. By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they couldve won. Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a  to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their   All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground. The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the  final. First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss. “It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states. Banagher had only been relegated from the first ision, and were billed as favourites. The cream against the second ision team. “There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal. A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds. After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane  In the league, Banagher had won close games between the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendance of nearly , flocked to Drum for the final. “We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues. “We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along. Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose. “Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who wouldve been Derry Citys fitness trainer. Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in. “It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.” Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed. Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.  Paddy Cassidy and Maurice McElhinney help Gavin Conwell from the pitch during the  final Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory. “It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds. Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four. “I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game. “Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.” “The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls. “It wouldve have been the main place,. The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds. There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights. *** The  chapter was dferent. Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point. In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay. By , Craigbane were top dogs again. After securing the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was like a fair day in Farahs. The story at the time was about the situation at Drumcree and local police resources were stretched. The bar was buzzing and it was the daylight hours before revellers spilled out on their way home. There was an interesting angle in the championship final that season. Alfie Dallas, Craigbanes  winning manager, was now in charge of Claudy. Low and behold, they met Craigbane in the final, with his son, Alfie junior, in fine fettle with seven points to his name in a comfortable win. “I have more memories of beating Banagher, because it meant more to us and we had already beaten Claudy,” Conrad McGuigan commented of the  success.  Sean Crossan, Shane Lynch, Gergal Moore and Gavin Conwell look on as Conrad McGuigan lts the  championship It was  before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney. They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game. The sides were level when Sean Currans shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle. “We shouldve been out,” Fergal Moore admits. “They were straight through,it had went over the bar, we were out.” A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship. A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy. Fergal Crossans alsofor the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team. Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour. Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbanes first venture following delay because of foot and mouth. “I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers. It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game. With every round, they grew as a team. “We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moores tongue, of their passage to glory. “Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their - to - win. “We beat Beragh - to five or six points. The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh werent long down from senior...it was probably the easiest game we played.” Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of , having picked up a fth medal and a second Ulster in , as part of a  managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory. Conrad finished up in , aged , but after having a great innings, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the clubs seventh championship. “I had played a bit of reserve football. The legs were starting to go, my game was based on pace. I was so lucky and looking back it was the right time for me to stop. I wouldnt have been playing , but just to be part of it and missing the the buzz of being involved when the club is on a run.” Now, it is all about the next generation and McGuigan, like many around the club, is confident. If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright. “There is enough talent within our club,we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.” When Gavin Conwell lted the Ulster Cup on a magical  night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse. So all the young weans could see all the cups. It sounded impulsive, but it wasnt. It was time to strike when the iron was hot. A decade on, those youngsters are now the tools to build Craigbanes next team to challenge for a championship.

Michael McMullan spoke to them about their memories. ***If you build it, they will come. The ghostly words inspired Ray Kinsella to build a field of dreams in the middle of his Iowa corn field in Kevin Costners  film of the same name. Craigbane also built for the future. A sharp left turn off the Slieveboy road and Gerry Crossan Park edges into view at the foot of Glenrandel brae. A state-of-the-art hall and gym. A fully floodlit pitch and one with training lights. A running track and a windmill spinning in the background. Its well used, worth every penny and the hours of planning. googletag.cmd.push Gavin Conwell, Ulster winning captain in , is the clubs Youth Officer and is passing on his knowledge to the next crop. Alfie Dallas, George Sharkey and Brian Conway also used the hall to the max. The future is in safe hands. Former senior manager Kevin Moore and Kieran McElhinney manage the minors. Ryan McDaid is involved with the Us. John Oacuteg Donaghy is Chairman. Former goalkeepers Paul McLaughlin and Gerard McLaughlin are on the committee. Its their turn to put a dferent stamp on the club. Next month, Craigbane will continue their rebuilding process in the unfamiliar surroundings of junior, almost  years since they were fingertips away from knocking Ballinderry out of the  Derry championship. The same season the Shamrocks ended as All-Ireland champions. googletag.cmd.push The last decade ravaged Craigbanes senior team of physicality and experience. Year by year, the youth has been thrown in. Now, theyre finding their feet. St Columbs Derry and Cathair Dhoire school teams have emerged with a Craigbane imprint. When St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy school team, under the guidance of current senior player Brian Rainey, there was also a strong Craigbane core.  Craigbanes  U championship winning team All coming from their U championship winning team of , when they beat a fancied Kilrea. “We, as a club, needed it,” manager Conrad McGuigan said after the game. “At the start of the year they beat us by  or  points, but I saw something in our boys in the second half – they didn’t lie down.” By September, they overturned the Pearses to land the silver. *** After early signs of football in the area during the s, St Josephs Craigbane wasnt founded until  and after a Division Three title, the  reserve success was their first championship. “We were starting to get to finals at that time,” Conrad McGuigan remembers of the beginning. “In , it was the th year of the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was our first final and we won it.” McGuigan, not yet , was beginning to cut his teeth in the senior team. After an appearance in the semi-final, he didnt play in the final against Loup. “The team included more of the older hands, it was a very settled team,” McGuigan outlines, before rattling off some of the names. “Noel Moore, Gerard McLaughlin, Shane Lynch, Harry Roe McLaughlin, Paddy Cartin, George Sharkey, Dermot Gormley and Damian OKane. “There were four Gormley brothers, Peter, God rest him, Colm, Leo and Brendan,” he adds. With the clash of green, Loup played in Ballinderry colours and Craigbane purchased a set of Down jersies for the game. “I also remember Loup taking home Martin OBrien from England for the game,” Conrad recalls. “He was a big player for them and that was the worry. Loup were favourites, but it worked out okay for us in the end.” With a first championship in the bag, McGuigan also hails Paul Dixon as being a huge influence on the team. He had ed from a stint with Burnley and was playing with Glentoran at the time. In , it took a replay to get over reigning junior champions Greenlough in the semi-final. Injury to Peter Gormley and his brother Colms sending off robbed them of their midfield pairing, remembers goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin. Gerry McElhinney came home from England to answer the call. Craigbane found themselves seven points down in the latter stages of the final to Claudy. Earlier in the game, Dixon missed a penalty and turned down the chance to take Craigbanes second penalty. Nobody  fancied it and up stepped McGuigan and his goal sparked their comeback.  The Craigbane team pictured before the  replay win over Claudy Still Claudy held the upper hand and it look a last throw of the dice, Conrad remembers. “There was about two minutes left and I put a ball into the square, it was more of a Hail Mary and hepunched it into the net. The goal earned a replay, which Craigbane won, - to - and retained their title, leading to a four-year stint in the senior championship. Away from the clubscene, McGuigan played in St Marys Belfasts  Sigerson Cup win over UCC. He was also playing with Derry Us and Tommy Diamond had called him into the senior , where he saw some initial action. While success followed his career path, so too did injury. If two leg breaks werent enough, a dislocated elbow and putting out his shoulder a few times added to the woe. *** Tyrone has played a central part in Fergal Moores le. As a corner forward, he played up front with Geoffrey McGonigle on the Derry minor team, beaten by the Red Hands at Omagh in . Married and living close to Errigal Ciarans home in Dunmoyle for the last  years, saw him faced with a  milejourney to train and play with Craigbane. Despite being approached by the Tyrone giants to transfer and the lure of senior championship football, he stuck with his roots. “We wouldve been training twice a week and maybe three times coming up to championship,” Moore outlines. “I was asked to joinbut I never really thought about it. If Craigbane didnt have a game, I would go and watch Errigal.” Loyalty to home club was too much, though he has helped coach his daughter Michealas ladies team. “I have been at Tyronegames, but I have just been shouting her name,” he jokes. “Youll not get me cheering come on Tyrone or anything like that.” After starting on the Craigbane senior team as an U in , it was  before he made his championship debut, coming on as a sub in the final against Magilligan. “It was easy enough in the finish,” he outlines of Craigbanes win. Through the minors, he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era. An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the s. “Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers. “A lot of the young boys in thephotographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as  senior captain. “Boys were saying I want to play with our senior team and it was a spur for the parish.” Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience. “The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley , Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace. At that stage, we wouldve given anybody in the county a good game for it,” McGuigan stresses. By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they couldve won. Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a  to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their   All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground. The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the  final. First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss. “It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states. Banagher had only been relegated from the first ision, and were billed as favourites. The cream against the second ision team. “There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal. A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds. After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane  In the league, Banagher had won close games between the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendance of nearly , flocked to Drum for the final. “We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues. “We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along. Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose. “Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who wouldve been Derry Citys fitness trainer. Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in. “It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.” Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed. Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.  Paddy Cassidy and Maurice McElhinney help Gavin Conwell from the pitch during the  final Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory. “It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds. Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four. “I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game. “Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.” “The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls. “It wouldve have been the main place,. The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds. There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights. *** The  chapter was dferent. Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point. In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay. By , Craigbane were top dogs again. After securing the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was like a fair day in Farahs. The story at the time was about the situation at Drumcree and local police resources were stretched. The bar was buzzing and it was the daylight hours before revellers spilled out on their way home. There was an interesting angle in the championship final that season. Alfie Dallas, Craigbanes  winning manager, was now in charge of Claudy. Low and behold, they met Craigbane in the final, with his son, Alfie junior, in fine fettle with seven points to his name in a comfortable win. “I have more memories of beating Banagher, because it meant more to us and we had already beaten Claudy,” Conrad McGuigan commented of the  success.  Sean Crossan, Shane Lynch, Gergal Moore and Gavin Conwell look on as Conrad McGuigan lts the  championship It was  before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney. They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game. The sides were level when Sean Currans shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle. “We shouldve been out,” Fergal Moore admits. “They were straight through,it had went over the bar, we were out.” A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship. A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy. Fergal Crossans alsofor the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team. Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour. Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbanes first venture following delay because of foot and mouth. “I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers. It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game. With every round, they grew as a team. “We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moores tongue, of their passage to glory. “Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their - to - win. “We beat Beragh - to five or six points. The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh werent long down from senior...it was probably the easiest game we played.” Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of , having picked up a fth medal and a second Ulster in , as part of a  managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory. Conrad finished up in , aged , but after having a great innings, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the clubs seventh championship. “I had played a bit of reserve football. The legs were starting to go, my game was based on pace. I was so lucky and looking back it was the right time for me to stop. I wouldnt have been playing , but just to be part of it and missing the the buzz of being involved when the club is on a run.” Now, it is all about the next generation and McGuigan, like many around the club, is confident. If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright. “There is enough talent within our club,we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.” When Gavin Conwell lted the Ulster Cup on a magical  night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse. So all the young weans could see all the cups. It sounded impulsive, but it wasnt. It was time to strike when the iron was hot. A decade on, those youngsters are now the tools to build Craigbanes next team to challenge for a championship.

Manager John McEvoy has stated he will respect the club window and is happy his players will be getting three or four games, to help their preparation for a showdown with Down. Feargal McGill. Director of Club, Player and Games Administration, told the County Derry Post of their plans for the unplayed league games. “It is definitely our intention to finish the leagues, the league finals in hurling and the remaining two rounds in football,” he commented. Derry hurlers are unbeaten so far this season, thanks to a late Conor Kelly point in their - to - draw against Kildare on Sunday, March . They will play Down in the Division B promotion final, hoping to go one better than last years defeat to Wicklow. googletag.cmd.push In football, Rory Gallaghers senior squad would need results to all fall for themthey were to gain promotion from Division . Derry, on five points, are two points behind Down and Longford. They would need Paddy Tallys men to lose both games to bottom of the table Leitrim and Louth. Derry hurling boss McEvoy also admitted that preparations after the lay-off will be a challenge. “We had a decent league and we were happy with the progress. We brought seven new guys into the setup. They added a lot to it,” he told the County Derry Post. McEvoy also felt that the break gave injured quartet Paddy Kelly, Mark Craig, Eamonn McGill and Darragh McCloskey time to recover, while he hopes they can get through the -week club championship period unscathed. googletag.cmd.push “We are going to respect the club window,” he stressed. ”All the players are going to be playing a lot of matches. Thankfully they are going to be getting three or four matches each, before they get into semi-finals and finals. “We have to look at this as a positive, they will be back hurling and their club managers will be working with them in terms of hand to eyeand doing lots of ball work. “When we get the green light in mid-September, well start back working with them and looking forward to that. It will be a short lead into the league final but there is nothing we can do with it.” This weeks release is also expected to have dates for the ious championships, including the Christy Ring Cup. “Im hearing dferent things about Joe McDonagh and Christy Ring, that they are going knock-out,” McEvoy stated. “Given the window, that wouldnt surprise you and that can go with you or against you. “I think they would play the threematches and thats what wed prefer, but at this stage I just dont know.” RELATED- Derry hope to make championship draws this weekMore...

Manager John McEvoy has stated he will respect the club window and is happy his players will be getting three or four games, to help their preparation for a showdown with Down. Feargal McGill. Director of Club, Player and Games Administration, told the County Derry Post of their plans for the unplayed league games. “It is definitely our intention to finish the leagues, the league finals in hurling and the remaining two rounds in football,” he commented. Derry hurlers are unbeaten so far this season, thanks to a late Conor Kelly point in their - to - draw against Kildare on Sunday, March . They will play Down in the Division B promotion final, hoping to go one better than last years defeat to Wicklow. googletag.cmd.push In football, Rory Gallaghers senior squad would need results to all fall for themthey were to gain promotion from Division . Derry, on five points, are two points behind Down and Longford. They would need Paddy Tallys men to lose both games to bottom of the table Leitrim and Louth. Derry hurling boss McEvoy also admitted that preparations after the lay-off will be a challenge. “We had a decent league and we were happy with the progress. We brought seven new guys into the setup. They added a lot to it,” he told the County Derry Post. McEvoy also felt that the break gave injured quartet Paddy Kelly, Mark Craig, Eamonn McGill and Darragh McCloskey time to recover, while he hopes they can get through the -week club championship period unscathed. googletag.cmd.push “We are going to respect the club window,” he stressed. ”All the players are going to be playing a lot of matches. Thankfully they are going to be getting three or four matches each, before they get into semi-finals and finals. “We have to look at this as a positive, they will be back hurling and their club managers will be working with them in terms of hand to eyeand doing lots of ball work. “When we get the green light in mid-September, well start back working with them and looking forward to that. It will be a short lead into the league final but there is nothing we can do with it.” This weeks release is also expected to have dates for the ious championships, including the Christy Ring Cup. “Im hearing dferent things about Joe McDonagh and Christy Ring, that they are going knock-out,” McEvoy stated. “Given the window, that wouldnt surprise you and that can go with you or against you. “I think they would play the threematches and thats what wed prefer, but at this stage I just dont know.” RELATED- Derry hope to make championship draws this weekMore...

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

Following a request from the Irish Central Border Area Network , the NIAO report will also look at the process used by BT for upgrading its own infrastructure. Mid Ulster District Councillor Sean McPeake said it was a positive development. “I have been supportive of the group’s request for an NIAO report to ensure future transparency around the lack of competition for Broadband infrastructure in the North,” he said. “The report is being currently compiled and crucially includes areas such as the process used by BT for upgrading their own infrastructure. googletag.cmd.push “I am confident that any positive recommendations which emulate from the report will be taken on board by Dept of Economy prior to the awarding of Project Stratum delivery contracts. “This is crucially required for the equitable roll-out of such a major broadband scheme that will have such major implications for future generations of rural people.” poundm of funding has been secured for Project Stratum, which aims to improve broadband connectivity at approximately , premises. There has been some criticism of theof time it will take to complete the improvements, with no upgrade work planned before the delivery of the project. googletag.cmd.push “Full delivery could take another - years, which does not address present needs,” said Cllr McPeake. “Rural areas such as Mid-Ulster need to have immediate interventions in broadband improvements to remain economically competitive and meet the needs of local homeowners. “Broadband availability has become a service utility which is equally essential as water, electricity or any telecommunications. “In recent months I have been inundated from constituents who cannot access sufficient broadband speeds for home-working, home-schooling or basic socialising. “Small to medium sized businesses are also struggling to achieve adequate speeds to operate their businesses in rural areas.” The Carntogher councillor has asked residents to detail their experiences in order to help with the evidence gathering process. “An integral part of the NIAO reporting evidence gathering process is having anecdotal evidence of the challenges of home working or home schooling during the ongoing public health crisis. “I would encourage anyone who is experiencing dficulties with Broadband provision during the COVID- Pandemic to email their experiences toinfo@icban.

On June , St Columbs College and Thornhill College announced they wouldnot use academic criteria for admissions to Year  in . Both St Columbs and Thornhill have used the GL Entrance Assessment results to select pupils since the old + exam was abolished in . However, in a joint letter to the parents, s and carers of children in Primary  published earlier this month, the schools announced pupils applying for September  will not have to sit the exam due to the educational disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Derrys two co-educational grammar schools, Lumen Christi College and Foyle College, are yet to confirmthey will require their  intake to sit atransfertest. The Derry News contacted both schools on thematter, but they declined to comment. Last week, two Northern Irish parents won High Court permission to challenge the decision to delay this year’s post-primary transfer tests by two weeks. Foyle Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan, who is the partyseducation spokesperson, asked schools to take the views of parents and educational specialists onboard when making a decision on the tests. While the purpose of this particular challenge is to delay these unfair and unregulatedtests, it will add to the growing public debate around academic selection. googletag.cmd.push This year, as a result of the COVID- pandemic, many schools have already taken the decision to suspend the use of academic selectiontestsand there are growing calls for it to be abandoned altogether. I would appeal to schools still intent on using academic selection to listen to the views of an increasing number of educationalists, trade unions and parents and endtransfertestsonce and for all.

On June , St Columbs College and Thornhill College announced they wouldnot use academic criteria for admissions to Year  in . Both St Columbs and Thornhill have used the GL Entrance Assessment results to select pupils since the old + exam was abolished in . However, in a joint letter to the parents, s and carers of children in Primary  published earlier this month, the schools announced pupils applying for September  will not have to sit the exam due to the educational disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Derrys two co-educational grammar schools, Lumen Christi College and Foyle College, are yet to confirmthey will require their  intake to sit atransfertest. The Derry News contacted both schools on thematter, but they declined to comment. Last week, two Northern Irish parents won High Court permission to challenge the decision to delay this year’s post-primary transfer tests by two weeks. Foyle Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan, who is the partyseducation spokesperson, asked schools to take the views of parents and educational specialists onboard when making a decision on the tests. While the purpose of this particular challenge is to delay these unfair and unregulatedtests, it will add to the growing public debate around academic selection. googletag.cmd.push This year, as a result of the COVID- pandemic, many schools have already taken the decision to suspend the use of academic selectiontestsand there are growing calls for it to be abandoned altogether. I would appeal to schools still intent on using academic selection to listen to the views of an increasing number of educationalists, trade unions and parents and endtransfertestsonce and for all.

Baby Michael MacHugh shocked his mum Sara and dad Conall in January of this year by arriving  weeks early. His parents were told that he had a % chance of survival. Michael ended up having to spend  weeks in hospital. During this time, Tinyle, a charity which supports families of premature babies, was a vital help to Sara and Conall. Michael is now at home and doing well but his family were keen to raise money for Tinyle. googletag.cmd.push Michael’s uncle Caolan , his dads identical twin, agreed to shave off his fair to support the charity.  Caolans friend, Owen Brady, also agreed to so the same thing, and, between them, the two men have managed to raise more than pound, for the charity. Michaels mum said it had been dficult time for their family. “Michael was born on th January  at  weeks + days gestation,  weeks early, weighing just lb oz. “He is now over lb at  weeks old. “His due date was th of April . Michael was born in Altnagelvin at .am and transferred to The Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast at pm that same day. googletag.cmd.push “He spent five and a half weeks in the Royal where he received four of his five blood transfusions and spent the last seven and a half weeks back in Altnagelvin, where he got his last blood transfusion. “During this hospital stay I was also told that a baby born at  weeks has a % survival rate, defying all the odds Michael is with us now, thankfully a happy healthy  week old. “He is smaller than other babies his age and developmentally has some catching up to do but he is a little fighter.” Sara said Tinyle had been a great support to them. “During our stay in hospital TinyLe were a huge support and continue to be there for us, by way of thanks we wanted to raise funds for the charity and so lockdown presented the perfect opportunity. “As lockdown has rolled on Michael’s uncle Caolan, his dads identical twin became increasingly in need of a visit to the barbers, we used this to our advantage and challenged Caolan to a head shave. “Caolan’s friend Owen Brady also braved the shave,” she added. “Our family and friends rallied their support and I’m delighted to say we have raised over pound, for for TinyLe.” Valerie Cromie, Head of Fundraising for TinyLe , said the funds raised would be put to good use. “We are greatly indebted to the MacHugh family for their generosity and to Caolan and Owen who were brave enough to take on the head shave challenge. “Funds raised will ensure families who experience the birth of a premature baby receive the practical and emotional support they need.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Patricia McCallion, who shot to fame on dating show Pretty Single, said she has used her unexpected down time to reboot and put the finishing touches to her first hair care range. I really enjoyed having that time to myselfand spendingtime with my daughter, but now that we can reopen Im very excitedto get back to work, she said. Pretty Single brought togethersix gorgeous single women who agreed to be stripped of their make-up before going on a series of blind dates. googletag.cmd.push  Patricia won the public over on the show with her bubbly personality and natural good looks and although she didnt manage to find love she says she has found friends for le. I still chat to my final two fellas on the show but its on a friendship basis, she said. I did go on a second and thirddate with Martin the barber, but I realised we are more like friends. I talk to the girls every single day though. Theres notmany times you get a group of girls togetherand everyone justgets on so well. Everybody is buying each othercards and presents on their birthdays- its lovely. googletag.cmd.push Since taking part in the show, Patricia has embraced a more natural look. I think Ive found lovely new friends and Ive found myself too, she said. I havent worn make-up in three weeks. I wouldnthave gone out the door before without running a make-up brushover my face. Itwas just the norm, like brushing my teeth. So its been very liberating. Earlier this month, Patriciafulfilled her lelong dream of launching her own hair care products, which are named Glam after her salon in Waterloo Street. It features two luxurious ranges SOS and Peyton, named after her  -year-old daughter. I started hairdressing at  and after Peyton was born working and being successfulwas all for her, she explained. I wanted her to be proud. Patricia was able to use lockdown to put the finishing touches to the range and she is delighted with the finished products. Getting to make the products was so educational but there was so much work involved in it, she admitted. Im so thankful that I had that time to properly work on it because I never thought it would be that stressful. I was nervous about it, but I have learnt to trust in myself. My clients trust that when I bring out a product I will have trialled it and tested it on myself and I have been doing hairdressing so long that I know what works.

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The funding is part of the Departments Major Capital Works Programme which will see nine schools in total benefit from improvements to their sites. St Patricks College, Maghera, and St Conors College, Kilrea and Clady are the two County Derry schools who will receive funding. Speaking today in the Assembly, Education Minister Peter Weir said the investment showed the Department was planning for the future. Improving the schools’ estate is one of my priorities and in the current unprecedented and dficult times, he said. googletag.cmd.push I hope this will send a strong signal to the local construction industry and local communities that the Department of Education is planning for the future and is committed to supporting the local economy and the wider community through the delivery of our capital programme. My Department’s capital programme aims to ensure that all our young people are educated in school facilities which are safe, secure and fit-for-purpose, enabling them to receive the quality education experience required to help them to fulfil their potential. St Conors College had been operating over two sites, in Kilrea and Clady, and principal Aine Bradley says the funding will help the transition to one site. googletag.cmd.push Our school community is thriving - since September  we have been living, learning and excelling together in the classroom and on the sports field, she said. Coming together in one building will give our school community even greater opportunity and a common goal. Our pupils will finally have access to the state of the art facilities and resources they deserve. I want to say thank you to the Governors, Staff, Pupils and School Communities in Kilrea and Clady for your patience, support and steadfast belief that we could achieve greatness together. Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone welcomed the inclusion of St Patricks College, Maghera in the Departments plans. I have been in regular contact with St Patricks College, Maghera on the need for improvements to the school estate over recent years. I have had visits with Department officials, the school principal, the chair of the board of governors and Councillor Martin Kearney on site to see the school facilities. While the major capital works projects for St Patrick’s College will now progress to the design stage, work will not likely commence until the   financial year. When completed, pupils and staff at St Patrick’s College will benefit from the provision of modern, fit-for-purpose facilities.

The message, decoratively presented in a sketched scroll, read: “Papered by Jack Kerr, King St Magherafelt. Painted by Joe Hughes of Moneyglass. The message also states that the named final member of the decorating crew done sweet f**k all! Jack Kerr was a painter who lived in King Street in the town and worked at the time for Seamus Keenan of Castledawson. He also ran a shop for a period on the street where he lived. googletag.cmd.push  Jack Kerrs shop on King St in Magherafelt.

Reverend McGonagle was coming in. “I came on a boy’s name from Aghagaskin, Surgenor I think it was, and it was written way before the turn of the century.” The practice led to Dermot making a remarkable discovery of coincidence as he peeled back some wallpaper in the late s. googletag.cmd.push “I was working on a job near the Loup – they were doing repairs and I was doing the painting for it.

Joe Hughes was originally from Moneyglass but now lives in Dunloy, County Antrim, and told us about the process of leaving their mark. “You went in and stripped the wall and before you papered it, you put a scroll on it and wrote the names on it,” he said. “I would have worked with Jack at the time, but It was Seamus Keenan we worked for and that was our trademark when we were in doing them up.

Reverend Katie McAteer’s appointment to the Chapter of the Cathedral Church of St Columb is one of two announced today by the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt Reverend Andrew Forster. Reverend Robert Boyd, the Rector of Glendermott and Newbuildings Parish, has also been appointed a Canon.By happy coincidence, today - the Feast Day of St John the Baptist - is the anniversary of both new canons’ ordinations. Rev Boyd and Rev McAteer will fill the positions left vacant following the departure of the Ferry brothers – Rev Canon David, who has retired, and Rev Malcolm, who has become the Rector of Agherton Parish in Portstewart. googletag.cmd.push Rev McAteer, who is the Pastoral Director of the Christ Church, Culmore, Muff and St Peter’s Group of Parishes, said she was humbled and honoured by the appointment.“When Bishop Andrew first asked me, I was totally taken aback,” Rev McAteer said. “It was never on my radar, never in a million years – or even  years – would I have expected the Bishop to ask me to accept this appointment. “St Columb’s Cathedral, probably more than any other cathedral, has been a history-maker – the first cathedral built in these islands after the Reformationplaying a leading role as a place of reconciliation – and now another brick is being laid in its rich history. googletag.cmd.push “I still keep thinking, ‘No, not me. It can’t be me.’ It’s exciting. It’s quite daunting. I’m humbled and honoured.” Rev McAteer, whose father was a Canon of Chester Cathedral, evoked the words of the Ordination Service. “Throughout ministry, whatever God calls us to do, we pray that He will give us ‘the needful gts of grace’ to fulfil that ministry. I’m hoping that this is at God’s direction I can only do this in God’s strength.” While this isnew territory for Rev McAteer, the second new canon is on familiar ground. Rev Boyd, was a Canon of St Patrick’s Cathedral in Armagh until three years ago, a position he relinquished when he was appointed incumbent of the Parish of Glendermott and Newbuildings. He has since taken up the role of Diocesan Director of Ordinands for Derry and Raphoe. “I feel very privileged and very honoured by the appointment,” Rev Boydsaid.  “I’m extremely grateful to Bishop Andrew for having the confidence in me to appoint me to this role and for thinking me worthy of it. I think it’s an honour, too, for the Parish of Glendermott and Newbuildings, so I’m very pleased that our parishioners are also being acknowledged and recognised by the Bishop.” The installation of a new canon is a signicant and joyful occasion for any cathedral but given its uniqueness, the forthcoming Service of Installation in St Columb’s – with its historical first – will arouse considerable interest within the Church of Ireland and beyond. A date has yet to be fixed for the Service but it is hoped it will take place in the early autumn.

His book has been described in The Independent as ldquoone of the finest pieces of modern nature writing in recent years. In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now. Having this facility available can help ease the pressure on other EDs and we cannot understand why there is not increased investment in Downpatrick.ldquoWe all understood the temporary closure of services at the Downe to allow health chiefs to respond to the global pandemic, but the time for those services to be reinstated is now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges. Sir Hans also treated the poor for free and was no slave trader.Cllr Walker said Sir Hans left Killyleagh for London when he was  where he studied chemistry, before deciding on a career in medicine, qualying in France and ing to London.He was subsequently appointed as the personal physician to the governor of Jamaica and it was there that he discovered drinking chocolate.When he ed to England, Sir Hans was able to market his find and Cadburyrsquos promoted this drink for many years.Cllr Walker said that Sir Hans, who has a centre named after him in his home town, encouraged inoculation against ious diseases and for  years was President of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Fellow and hard working secretary of the Royal Society for many years.ldquoWe in Killyleagh are rightly very proud of Sir Hans and his links with our town, he continued.The councillor added: ldquoI hope that his statue in London will remain in place as he was a man of great distinction which is evidenced by the fact that there is now a centre dedicated to him in his home town.

In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go. The Downe hospital must live on, developing all the time the range of services it offers.Equality demands nothing less..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Revered servant of local cricket  ","story":"Robin Walsh remembers Alfie Linehan, the distinguished Downpatrick cricket stalwart who died last yearTHE great paradox of Alfie Linehan was to be found in his disposition on the cricket field and off it.At the crease, his was a belligerent style, hitting the ball farther than anyone , compiling his runs in a manner that kept the scorers busy. Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during .

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id

option to alleviate potential flood risk.More NewsVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldMillions become unpaid carers due to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become

including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen we consider the marginal

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

Thatrsquos why we took the decision to bring back all of the beer from the on-trade. vw,vw,px, px\"Aidan Crowe, director of operations at the St Jamesrsquos Gate brewery He added: ldquoBasically what we do is we take all the keg beer back and we decant it and we disperse the product through a number of environmentally sustainable routes.ldquoThe vast majority of the beer goes to willow and Christmas tree plantations, itrsquos used as nutrients in those farms.ldquoWersquove also erted some product through to anaerobic digesters, where it produces a bio-gas.ldquoActually, wersquore quite optimistic that, in the long term, that bio-gas can be a suitable fuel source for us to use here in the brewery.ldquoAnd then wersquove also erted some of the product for composting.ldquoSo itrsquos an unprecedented problem for us to have and we wanted to ensure that in terms of how we manage that and manage the beer it was environmentally sustainable, because thatrsquos so critically important, not just for our business, but obviously for the country as a whole as well. vw,vw,px, px\"Brewing team member Steve Gilson checks on the progress of a tank of Guinness at the St Jamesrsquos Gate brewery Asked how many litres had been ed, Mr Crowe said: ldquoYoursquod probably make me cryI started to add it all up, but itrsquos hundreds of thousands of kegs and wersquove still got some products to decant and wersquove still got some markets that havenrsquot finished ing their beer to us. So a lot of beer and a lot of kegs.The main brew house at St Jamesrsquos Gate produces . million hectolitresa year.That amounts to  pints a second all year round.Ordinarily, St Jamesrsquos brews . million pints of Guinness every day and . million pints of other beer and stout.But all that was scaled back in the last two weeks of March and first week of April.ldquoOur biggest job really over that period of time was just managing what was an unprecedented downturn, said Mr Crowe.ldquoProbably going back to , actually, is the last time we had such a dramatic short-term change.ldquoNow, thankfully, wersquore on the other side of that, wersquore ramping up very, very strongly through the months of June and July. vw,vw,px, px\"Kegs of Guinness stacked ready for distribution at the St Jamesrsquos Gate brewery St Jamesrsquos Gatersquos three largest markets are Great Britain, Ireland and North America but overall it distributes to  countries worldwide.All stout, beer and ale produced at the height of lockdown was used only for canned products.So while the kegging operation at St Jamesrsquos Gate ground to a near halt, canning and bottle operations in Belfast and Runcorn actually stepped up production, to meet the added demand from the off-sales trade.Mr Crowe said the biggest challenge the brewery now faces is the uncertainty about what demand will look like in the first few months of eased restrictions.ldquoWersquove got to be prepared for dferent eventualities, he said.ldquoIf itrsquos slower than we expect, wersquove got to be ready for that. If itrsquos signicantly busier than we expect, wersquove got to be ready for that too. And we are ready, we will be ready.ldquoItrsquos a much nicer set of challenges to be trying to manage than the challenges that we had back in March when everything was being ramped down..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Guinness fertilises Christmas trees as lockdown black stuff recycled article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Craigavon Borough Council’s Ulster Unionist grouping will meet today to discuss a range of matters including the name of a new £ million leisurecentre.By The NewsroomMonday, nd June , : pm\"\"A perspective of the new South Lake Leisure Centre in Craigavon.The meeting of the UUP council group is, the Local Democracry Reporting Service understands, due to take place at pm, just over two hours before Council’s monthly meeting at which the DUP will present a controversial proposal to name the South Lake Leisure Centre ‘Centinary Leisure Centre’.The proposal looks certain to ide the chamber and due to the make up of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, the Ulster Unionist Party’s vote will be crucial to its success or failure.SDLP Councillor Joe Nelson has called on the UUP to vote against it and described the move as “nothing more than a political stunt”.“The proposal will be taken by the Catholic Nationalist community as another insult by the DUP group on Council as it continues to try and drag us back to the ‘Ballygobackwards’ days of Craigavon Council,” said Councillor Nelson.“It is a slap in the face to nationalist people and I would urge the Ulster Unionist Party to stand up and be counted.”The Alliance Party has also come out in opposition to the proposal, with party group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson concerned such a move would require an equality impact assessment.“Any change at this late stage would mean further delay to the opening of the centre and additional cost to ratepayers as an Equality Impact Assessment would have to be satisfied, signage replaced at a potential cost of more than £k and planning implications would have to be considered,” said Cllr Tennyson.“We may even find ourselves in a position where residents are left without leisure provision altogether for an extended period.”He continued: “The centenary of Northern Ireland is a signicant event in our shared history, and of course it is right that we mark it in a thoughtful, inclusive and informative way.“Now, more than ever, people want to see their councillors showing leadership, working together and focused on the ongoing pandemic.“Engaging in political point-scoring or afaux fight over the name of a leisure centre ismerely a distraction from that.”Speaking last week, DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter said of the proposal: “Our country celebrates a great milestone on May  next year, our th anniversary as a nation within the United Kingdom.“Given the current economic situation, we, as a party, discussed a fitting and inexpensive way to mark this signicant anniversary, so we will propose that the Council officially name the new leisure centre in Craigavon as the ‘Centenary Leisure Centre’.”A decision on the proposal will be taken at tonight’s full meeting of Armagh City, Banbridge and CraigavonBorough Council.Sinn Fein was asked for comment.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most

From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing.Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change.Mr Swann stated: “I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfadceaff   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aeaeefffeca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
