With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th. If Ireland votes No, the Eight Amendment will remain.

Clearly I was not always coming across the way I intended.\u0027The actor also stated that he did not assault any women, create an unsafe work environments or offer employment or advancement opportunities in exchange for sexual favors.That does not contradict the CNN report, in which one woman alleged that the actor tried to lift her skirt on set but most spoke of comments that Freeman made which made them feel uncomfortable including the reporter who wrote the story, Chloe Melas.She was six-months pregnant when she claims Freeman made a number of comments about her during an interview which she deemed inappropriate and told her supervisors about the following day. Freeman also said in his statement: \u0027I am devastated that 80 years of my life is at risk of being undermined, in the blink of an eye, by Thursday\u0027s media reports.\u0027 The accusations did not cause him to lose his role in The Poison Rose, but he was quickly dropped by Visa and as the voice of Vancouver\u0027s public transportation system.There has also been talk of the Screen Actor\u0027s Guild possibly taking away his lifetime achievement award.

Metaphors and hidden meanings had no place in a production that never stopped bellowing its messages in our faces. This might be the loudest piece of TV ever made.Emma Thompson (Goneril) screamed at her father’s army rabble till her veins popped. Emily Watson (Regan) shrieked fit to shatter glass as her fingernails dug out the eyes of the Duke of Gloucester (Jim Broadbent).Everybody tried to outshout everyone else, Hopkins loudest of all. He was never knowingly caught underacting, nor underdoing the symbolism of a broken Britain.The stormy heath that Shakespeare imagined for the king’s mad scenes became a refugee camp filled with starving immigrants, and then a concrete shopping centre in a soulless new town.Hopkins has wanted to make this TV version for a long time — so long that he once had a teenage Keira Knightley in mind for young Cordelia, instead of Florence Pugh. Now he’s finally brought it to the screen, the 80-year-old has been selling it for all he’s worth, even boasting (like Lear) of his real-life estrangement from his daughter.Some of the casting was inspired. Jim Carter, the eternal butler of Downton Abbey, was perfect as the loyal Kent, and Tobias Menzies (best-known as Black Jack Randall in Outlander) was wickedly nasty as the Duke of Cornwall.Menzies will play Prince Philip in the next series of The Crown, which doesn’t bode well for the Buckingham Palace spin doctors.Thank goodness for a writer who doesn\u0027t treat viewers like...Share this articleYet Christopher Ecclestone was an odd choice for Goneril’s effete footman, Oswald.

Now, for the first time, we can reveal the true cost of paying in sterling overseas.Are you bills about to rise? Some energy customers face bill...My partner and I are planning a trip to Japan next spring,...Get more for your holiday money: The best debit and credit...Share this articleIn an experiment run by Starling Bank, identical twins Heidi and Alice, 29, travelled to Berlin for a weekend. They made exactly the same purchases and both used the same debit card, which charges no extra fees for spending abroad.The only difference was that each time they used their cards, Heidi paid in the local currency, euros, whereas Alice paid in pounds.          Alice (pictured above) and Heidi carried out seven transactions and in each case it was more expensive to pay in pounds           For every transaction, it worked out more expensive to pay in pounds.In the worst case, the difference was almost 10 per cent — which means you would lose £100 if you spent £1,000 over the course of your holiday.Most restaurants, shops and cash machines overseas give tourists the option to pay in sterling — this is known as dynamic currency conversion. It can be tempting as it means you’ll be able see straight away how much the transaction will cost you in pounds and pence. But the conversion rates used by foreign firms almost always work out as more expensive than if you had paid in the local currency and left it to your own bank or credit card provider to convert the cost.UK banks typically use the exchange rate offered by Visa or Mastercard, which is as near to a perfect rate as you can get.In this experiment, Alice and Heidi, who live in South East London, carried out seven transactions and in each case it was more expensive to pay in pounds. Even in the best cases, the extra cost of paying in pounds was still 3.1 per cent of the total bill.The worst offender was a cash machine at Berlin airport, where both twins withdrew €200. Heidi chose to be charged in euros, which worked out as £177.44 at the Mastercard exchange rate.          The research showed that even if your debit or credit card charges a fee on spending overseas, it would still work out cheaper to pay in the local currencyAlice, on the other hand, accepted the offer to convert the €200 to pounds there and then using the foreign bank’s rate. This ended up costing her £195.18 — an extra £17.74 or 10 per cent.When the sisters later split a €43.86 bill for cocktails at their hotel, the difference was far smaller. Heidi paid her €21.93 bill in euros, which worked out at £19.45. Alice paid in pounds, costing her £20.06 — an extra 61p or 3.1 per cent.The next day, the twins went shopping and each bought a scarf, a pair of trainers and a top from three different stores. Heidi paid in euros, spending €7.95, €69.10 and €9.99 — which worked out at £7.05, £61.30 and £8.86 respectively.Alice again converted her bills to pounds and ended up paying £7.28, £63.31 and £9.15. So altogether she paid an extra £2.53.After lunch — where, unusually, they weren’t offered the option of paying in pounds — they visited the Museum of Berlin, which had a €12 entry fee. Accepting the on-the-spot conversion cost Alice £11.05, while Heidi paid only £10.64.Finally, at the airport the following morning, the twins bought some €12.50 chocolates from a duty-free shop. Heidi, as usual, paid in euros, which later worked out at £11.09. After agreeing to pay in pounds, the chocolates cost Alice £11.70 — an extra 61p or 5.5 per cent.In many of these examples the difference between paying in pounds and euros is just a few pence. But over the course of a holiday this can add up. In fact, the rip-off is estimated to cost British tourists around £500million every year, according to travel money firm FairFX.At the end of the Berlin trip, Alice had spent a total of £317.73 — an extra £21.90 compared to Heidi.While this isn’t an enormous sum, it is an easy saving to make — all it requires is that you push a different button on the card machine. Experts say that some businesses are failing to give tourists a choice and automatically convert the bill into pounds.A spokesman for Starling Bank says: ‘This isn’t always intentional as sometimes shop assistants or waiting staff don’t understand and presume they are doing their customers a favour by selecting to pay in pounds for them. But in line with the law, cardholders should be given a choice before they pay.’Starling Bank’s research also showed that even if your debit or credit card charges a typical 2.99 per cent fee on spending overseas, it would still work out cheaper to pay in the local currency. FairFX is offering This is Money readers a free prepaid Mastercard currency exchange card.

Now, however, she has ‘locked-in’ syndrome. Her alert and able brain is marooned in an immobile body her mouth cannot articulate her thoughts.I imagined her condition would also have deprived her of humour and (as she cannot speak) the capacity to express it outwardly. Surely to be rendered mute and motionless must be the worst kind of imprisonment?But by some quirk of nature, and against all logic and reason, Shirley can still physically laugh. And she does so often and infectiously, bringing joy to all those around her.‘Shirley is definitely the happiest person I know,’ says one of her round-the-clock carers, Valerie Griffiths. ‘There are lots of lively and hilarious episodes with her. We laugh all the time. This isn’t a sombre job. Actually, it’s uplifting.’          Shirley, pictured with her father Henry Dennis on her wedding day aged 20 in 1980More than that, Shirley, 57, tells me — writing slowly on a computer operated by a sensor she works with her right cheek — that she is happy in some ways actually happier than she was in her former, able-bodied life.It is a startling admission and I ask her to explain. The answer takes shape slowly as she types.‘My former life was busy, noisy, pressurised and stressful, and now it’s quiet, peaceful and calm, with more time to fully appreciate life,’ she writes. ‘I’ve never really considered it before but I probably do feel liberated from the trappings of a normal working life.‘I certainly appreciate other people more and have time to fully enjoy the important things like being with friends and family. I think I feel a different kind of happiness now, born out of contentment.’It is an extraordinary response. Few of us who have the liberty to move and talk can think about being deprived of these faculties without utter horror. But Shirley has astounded, delighted and humbled me in the few weeks I have known her. She is, quite frankly, an extraordinary inidual.We spent several weeks swapping emails — she returning eloquent, thoughtful and often witty responses to my questions — before I visit her.I ask Shirley if she has ever, in her darkest days, succumbed to despair ever considered taking her own life.Her answer is emphatic. ‘Not even for a split second,’ she tells me. ‘My view is that a limited life is better than no life at all. However, I respect the views of those who differ. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.‘There were many dark moments during the first year,’ she concedes. ‘I cried a lot. But as my level of acceptance increased, so did my level of happiness.’She lives in a village on the edge of Dartmoor, Devon, in a specially-adapted bungalow next to a residential care home. Light streams through the French doors. There is a view of fields, and her cats, Smudge and Tigger, stretch languidly in the sun.  Shirley, pictured left on her wedding day in 1980 and right, aged 36, graduating from the University of the West of England in Bristol was not expected to survive her strokeShirley remains married to her husband, whom she won’t name (‘he’d kill me!’) but who lives nearby and visits often. He still runs the family farm on which she grew up.They didn’t have any children, which, she says, is not a regret because she did not want any in the first place.A good and loyal wife still, she respects his privacy. Questions as to how he copes with their situation, the nature of their relationship, whether he has found someone else, and whether she would be accepting if he did, are batted away with good humour but certitude. The no-nonsense, ruddy country girl has not gone away.‘I still love my husband,’ she says. ‘He makes me laugh. I miss him not being with me but I accept he couldn’t care for me. It would be a very demanding job. But it’s important that I’m still married.’ And that is the end of the conversation.Her constant companions are her carers. Valerie, 58 — cheerful and calm with a lilting Welsh accent — has been one of two regular carers for five-and-a-half years and works for two weeks, staying overnight in the bungalow’s bright spare bedroom, then has two weeks off when another carer comes.Extra carers from the adjacent home come in three times daily to help dress, wash and feed Shirley.She is still fiercely independent in many ways, however. She shops for clothes and groceries on the internet and manages her own care.          Shirley, aged 13 in school‘She types notes to us each day about food portions, heating, what she’d like to wear the positioning of the bed — things like that,’ explains Valerie.‘Are you allowed to say if you don’t like a carer?’ I ask Shirley. She laughs. ‘I’ve done so loads of times,’ she says. ‘I’ve sent carers away! I look for humour, patience no fuss.’It is a measure of her tenacity and determination that since she became locked in she has taken two Open University degrees — a Bachelor’s and a Master’s in social sciences with politics.The graduation certificates are framed and proudly displayed on the wall.For four hours a day, Shirley studied with the help of computer software that read books aloud to her. Exams were a test of endurance: Shirley was permitted four hours for every one hour of a usual exam.This meant standard three-hour exams — completed at her home in the presence of an invigilator — took 12 hours and were spaced over three days.I ask if the feeling of triumph when she graduated was magnified because of the effort involved. ‘Definitely!’ She smiles.She is an only child and her mum, who died three years ago, never properly recovered from the shock of seeing her daughter so severely disabled. ‘It was very hard for her,’ says Shirley, with understatement.Her dad Henry, who turned 90 in April, visits twice weekly and takes her on outings, usually to a park in Okehampton, and sometimes out to lunch. She enjoys the occasional vodka and orange. Eating and tasting food — which she is fed in pureed form — is also a positive pleasure that might have been denied to her had she not been so determined to learn to swallow.‘After my stroke I was fed through a peg-tube direct into my stomach,’ she remembers.‘I wasn’t even able to swallow saliva and I was told that I’d never be able to swallow. But with practice, initially through illicit consumption of chocolate buttons at the rehab centre where I went after hospital, I reached my goal of being able to eat.’Who fed you the forbidden chocolate buttons? I ask, amused. ‘My husband!’ she says. ‘I suppose you could have choked?’ I remark.She raises her eyes upwards, her signal for yes, and types: ‘But he didn’t dare say no!’          Despite her condition, she has successfully completed two Open University degrees - a Bachelor\u0027s and a Master\u0027s in social sciences with politics Grit and tenacity have always been strong components of Shirley’s personality — she would joke that she is actually ‘stubborn and awkward’ — and neither of these qualities has diminished since her stroke.She says she often thinks about her old life — not with wistful regret, but with pleasure that she has good memories to draw upon — and about the job she loved, her marriage and the farm.Her leisure time used to be full of activity. She loved aerobics, socialising with friends and, having grown up on her parents’ farm, the countryside and walking were in her blood.History remains a passion. Holidays in her old life were spent travelling to places ‘that had a bit of history about them’. Today, she admits the logistics are tricky — every outing assumes the complexity of a military manoeuvre — so she doesn’t venture far from home for more than a few days.In her old life she qualified as a solicitor through sheer hard graft. Having joined a law firm in Okehampton as an office junior straight from school at 17, she became a secretary, then, after a few years, studied to become a legal executive by correspondence course, while doing her day job.Finally she qualified in law in 1997 — her area of expertise was residential conveyancing — studying at weekends and passing her exams while still running a busy legal practice.          Shirley learned how to swallow again after being smuggled chocolate buttons by her husband while in a rehab centreEverything came to an abrupt halt one awful Sunday morning in December 2002. Shirley recalls: ‘I woke up with a splitting headache and, when I tried to get out of bed, I found that I had severe vertigo so went back to bed and stayed there much of the day.‘I felt a bit better late afternoon, and as I thought that some fresh air would do me good, I got up and went down to the farm for a walk.‘While I was there, I thought I would make myself useful and feed a few of the animals. But, while I was doing it, I felt a bit dizzy so sat down on a pile of hay.‘It was obviously then that I had my stroke, because the next thing I knew I was coming around in intensive care a couple of weeks later.’Much of what happened during her four weeks in hospital is obliterated from her memory. However, during the ensuing 16 months in a neurological rehab centre, the implications of the stroke hit her. ‘I didn’t handle it well. I cried a lot,’ she says of those early days.I wonder if the terror of being unable to communicate was her worst fear, but she explains that even in the early weeks she learned to raise her eyes to signal ‘yes’ and look down to indicate ‘no’.Communication with Shirley is necessarily a laborious process. If she is not at her computer, she spells out words with the help of an alphabet board, building them up painstakingly by blinking when her listener indicates the correct letter on the board.Inside, of course, her active brain is buzzing her sentences ready-formed into eloquent expressions of thought.I cannot imagine, I say, how frustrating it must be when strangers assume she does not understand them, because of her disability, and talk to her carer instead.‘At first it annoyed me,’ she admits. ‘But I’ve come to accept it as inevitable. Most people have never even heard of locked-in syndrome, let alone know what it is, so don’t know what to expect and can only go on appearance.‘I occasionally get frustrated when people don’t understand what I’m trying to say, but generally I’ve accepted my condition. It happened, I can’t turn the clock back, so I’ve just got to make the best of it.’Acceptance. It seems to be the key to Shirley’s happiness. That, and her obdurate refusal to ever capitulate.When she came out of rehab, it was obvious she would need professional care. Medics favoured a nursing home, but Shirley, then just 42, did not agree. ‘I’m not at all suited to institutional living,’ she says. ‘I’m far too independent. So they had to think again.’Their solution was judicious and creative. Her little bungalow, in a small assisted living complex next to the care home, gives her both a degree of autonomy and the comfort of knowing that, aside from her regular carer, there is constant support at hand. ‘Thankfully,’ she adds, ‘apart from the occasional bit of cramp or backache that everyone gets, I’m not in pain.’Because Shirley has such a rare capacity for joy, a visit to her home leaves you filled with an unexpected optimism that even the bleakest of personal tragedies can be turned into triumph.          Shirley said her life changed in December 2002 when she had a splitting headache and was unable to get out of bed because of vertigo‘I find joy in almost anything, no matter how small,’ she says. ‘And recently I’ve experienced the joy of watching my beloved Manchester City, who I’ve supported for 50 years, have such a record-breaking season.‘I’m very much a lady of leisure these days and, unless I’m going out, I spend much of the daytime at the computer, keeping in touch with friends and family by email or via Facebook, surfing the internet or watching TV.‘I like watching most sports, as well as historical documentaries and comedy. I laugh at just about anything and I generally laugh loudly. In fact, I only have to think of something funny and I start giggling.‘I’ve come to the conclusion,’ she adds, ‘that my brain’s default setting is happiness’ — and as I wave goodbye to her and turn to walk down the drive, once again I hear the glorious ripple of her laughter. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/09/4C94C77000000578-0-image-a-4_1527151520398.jpg","title":"Britains biggest beer festival offer alcohol free ales time history","story":"    A Dutch beer will be the first alcohol-free ale on sale at the Campaign for Real Ale’s Great British Beer Festival in AugustBraxzz Brewery has developed an alcohol-free IPA and the world’s first alcohol-free porter ale.Coca-Cola launches its first ever alcoholic drink: Fizzy...See what alcohol does to the heart: Shocking images show the...Share this articleFestival organiser Catherine Tonry said: “Alcohol-free beer has become increasingly important in recent years and thankfully brewers have been keeping pace with consumer demands. “There are now some fantastic innovations in the sector and a much wider range of styles and flavours than ever before.“We are thrilled to provide an alcohol-free alternative to festival-goers who cannot or choose not to drink.”          Festival organiser Catherine Tonry says alcohol-free beer has become increasingly popular with consumersJames Leary, of Braxzz, said: “We are delighted to be attending the Great British Beer Festival for hopefully the first of many appearances.“We hope to provide something different at the event and give another option to anybody who will not be drinking but still want to taste craft ale.” "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/22/4CBCEA8F00000578-0-image-a-64_1527629651446.jpg","title":"Record pensions 17 000 women retiring year","story":"    Women are rapidly closing the gender pension gap with men seeing the difference half over the past decade to just £5,000 as a result of many mothers returning to work after childrenKirsty Anderson, from Prudential, said: ‘As working patterns continue to change and become more flexible, and shared parental leave is more widely encouraged by the government agenda and employers, the future looks positive for narrowing the retirement gender gap.’Trail of destruction!

Terrified shoppers flee as...Share this article‘But, from the first day he joined the school, it became evident that he had a talent for football that was way beyond his years.’Thirteen years and 37 England caps later, Raheem Shaquille Sterling’s success on the football pitch continues to be as stratospheric as his all-too-regular failures off it.          Sterling, pictured here with his girlfriend Paige Lee Hansel, is part of Gareth Southgate\u0027s squad to travel to Russia next month for the World CupOn one hand, the rise of the 23-year-old star represents an old-fashioned sporting fairy tale: a working-class boy who came to the UK as an infant and, through talent and hard graft, has achieved fame and fortune beyond the wildest dreams of his immigrant single mother.A key figure in Manchester City’s title-winning season, scoring 18 goals in the process, the £200,000-a-week forward will be cheered by a nation when he takes the field at the coming World Cup.Yet, on the other hand, this supposed role model has for far too long allowed himself to be defined by acute lapses in judgment that — in the eyes of many critics, at least — have turned him into a symbol of the amorality that is today at the heart of the so-called Beautiful Game.Recent years have seen court appearances, at least one reported tryst with a prostitute and secret dates with a Playboy model who was most certainly not Paige Lee Hansel, the long-suffering fiancee and mother of his youngest child Thiago.  Sterling has been photographed taking \u0027Hippy Crack\u0027, left, and with a shisha pipe, rightOn social media, where he shares images and videos of his gaudy mansion in Cheshire, purchased for £3.1 million in 2016, high-end cars (he’s said to own seven — one for each day of the week) and collection of bling wristwatches, he’s also been filmed smoking and inhaling a mind-altering intoxicant known as ‘hippy crack.’In this ignoble tradition came yesterday’s somewhat bizarre controversy over Sterling’s decision to get a large new tattoo — of an M16 assault rifle.He showed off the design, running down the lower half of his right leg, in a photo shared with his 3.6 million followers on Instagram on Monday.It was taken at England’s training ground in Staffordshire as players assembled to start preparations for the World Cup, which begins in just over a fortnight.Critics promptly condemned it as provocative and irresponsible, pointing out that more than 60 people have been killed by gun and knife violence in London this year alone and that similar weapons have been used in countless recent mass shootings in the U.S.Branding it ‘sickening’, ‘disgusting’ and ‘totally unacceptable’, the lobby group Mothers Against Guns called for him to be dropped from the England side.Lucy Cope, whose son was shot dead outside a London club, said: ‘He’s supposed to be a role model, but chooses to glamorise guns.’Last night, her words were echoed by the father of Damilola Taylor, who was stabbed to death in a street attack aged ten.Richard Taylor told The Sun: ‘Young people look up to footballers. Sterling hasn’t displayed the discipline we expect. He should be reprimanded and made to apologise to victims’ families.’Iffat Rizvi, who runs the Starr anti-guns campaign, said: ‘This is disrespectful to young people who lost their lives.’      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/17/1EE3252000000578-0-image-m-63_1527609689005.jpg","title":"Royal Sophie launches foul mouthed defence disgraced Kids Company founder","story":"    Actress Sophie Winkleman (pictured with husband Lord Frederick Windsor), Prince Michael of Kent\u0027s daughter-in-law, launched a foul-mouthed defence of the colourful former charity boss Camila BatmanghelidjhLady Frederick Windsor tells me: \u0027They don\u0027t tell the truth.

Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.\u0027 It appears the cancellation of the show will also affect the cast\u0027s Emmy prospects, as ABC revealed it is suspending the show\u0027s FYC (For Your Consideration) campaign. Other networks including Viacom also dropped reruns of the original Roseanne as the industry turned its back on the show and its star performer. The swift fallout from the tweet began when Wanda Sykes  quit her role as the show\u0027s consulting producer and celebrities condemned Barr\u0027s words.   Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, also revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled. \u0027I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed. The racist and distasteful comments from Roseanne are inexcusable,\u0027 the 18-year-old wrote. \u0027As I called my manager to quit working on Roseanne, I was told it was cancelled.

To represent potions of society often marginalized,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027In this moment it is important to be clear. We must stand up against bias, hatred, bigotry, and ignorance to make society a better place for all.\u0027  Many called on ABC to fire Barr or drop the show as others criticized the broadcast network for its enduring silence amid recent controversies with the comedian.Others were skeptical that ABC would dare touch the hit series, which is the third highest-rated show this year following Sunday Night Football and This Is Us.The revival of Roseanne was a ratings juggernaut when it premiered on ABC to a whopping 25 million viewers in April.It\u0027s surprising success even elicited a congratulatory phone call and tweet from President Donald Trump. Ratings dropped steadily thereafter, with last week\u0027s season finale garnering 10.33 million viewers.ABC  initially ordered 13 episodes for the second season and said the show would move away from its controversial politics and focus on family.          Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim, despite there being no supporting evidence           Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski          When one user called Barr\u0027s tweet racist, she proclaimed that \u0027Muslims r NOT a race\u0027           Roseanne later tweeted, in an attempt to defend her controversial joke, that \u0027Islam is not a race\u0027          She also retweeted an article with the headline: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027The show most recently came under fire for featuring an episode in which Barr\u0027s character believes her new Muslim neighbors are terrorists. Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 in her Tuesday tweet seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim. Jarrett, who was Obama\u0027s senior adviser during his presidency, was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz for six years. The family had moved to Iran because her father was part of a program that sent American physicians to help developing countries. He ran a children\u0027s hospital.There has never been any indication that Jarrett or her parents are Muslim.  Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski. \u0027ABC is doing their best to ignore some of these statements from Roseanne and she is making it really hard for them by taking it to the next level here,\u0027 he wrote. After Roseanne responds, Kaczynski replied: \u0027understand it\u0027s a joke, but can you see why some people think comparing a black woman to Planet of the Apes might be racist and find the Muslim Brotherhood reference to be conspiratorial and Islamophobic?\u0027  \u0027Child rapist\u0027 left covered in blood after violent attack by mobOfficer punches bikini-clad girl in the head during arrestChilling moment man is arrested for murdering his partnerEDL founder Tommy Robinson arrested by police outside courtCar enthusiast breaks John O\u0027Groats to Land\u0027s End land speed recordBlack woman rants at Jewish man as he calls her racist on NY metroCaravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overShocking moment bus crash leaves dozens of vehicles destroyed    A number of stars have since condemned Barr for the tweet, including Patricia Arquette and Julianne Moore. Rev Al Sharpton used ABC to fire Barr, while Rosie O\u0027Donnell defended her          Not everyone was happy with ABC\u0027s decision to cancel the show. Some stood by in their support for Barr, while others said the network should have continued without her A number of celebrities  also condemned Barr for the tweet, with some urging ABC to fire her from the show completely.\u0027I am repulsed that Valerie Jarret had that racist and bigoted \u0027joke\u0027 made at her expense and I am sickened that any Black or Muslim person has to keep hearing this sickness in 2018,\u0027 Patricia Arquette tweeted. \u0027You can take @RoseanneOnABC out of racism but you can\u0027t take the racism out of @therealroseanne,\u0027 Don Cheadle wrote. \u0027I told y\u0027all about Roseanne.

So,\u0027 author Roxane Gay added, to which Julianne Moore replied: \u0027Yes you did. #FireRoseanne.\u0027 Reverend Al Sharpton also criticized the comedian and called on ABC to \u0027take action now\u0027. \u0027The comparison by Rosanne Barr on ABC of Former Obama aide, Valerie Jarrett to an APE is racist and inexcusable,\u0027 he tweeted. Tomi Lahren was a rare prominent conservative voice to hit out at Roseanne. \u0027What Roseanne said was wrong,\u0027 she tweeted. \u0027I\u0027m sure she knows that.

the worst fire in Britain for a generationThe report also recognised that, in certain respects, the voluntary sector \u0027came up short, with some systems, structures and approaches not fit for purpose\u0027.Among its recommendations, the report said erse communities need to receive support that is sensitive to their varying needs, and such capabilities need to be embraced as core to emergency response in the UK.It said disaster response systems, behaviours and interventions all need to be tailored to the \u0027varying local socio-economic and cultural dynamics\u0027.The report recommended that, in a major disaster, local secular and faith organisations can draw on their \u0027local rootedness\u0027 to act quickly and sensitively in line with the needs of communities they understand.This capability needs to be better appreciated and supported, including in partnership with local authorities and national actors with expertise in emergency response, the report said.A spokesman for Kensington and Chelsea Council said: \u0027We are committed to learning the lessons from the Grenfell tragedy and therefore we welcome this report as part of the learning process.\u0027However, it is not right for the council to comment in detail at this stage -

Rejection: President Sergio Mattarella vetoed the 5-StarLeague\u0027s choice of eurosceptic Paolo Savona as economy minister which scuppered the formation of a government this weekInstead, President Mattarella designated former IMF official Carlo Cottarelli to head a politically neutral government, which riled 5 Star and the League - and did nothing to calm financial markets.Mr Cottarelli returned for informal discussions with Mr Mattarella yesterday, after asking for more time to come up with a list of cabinet ministers, and left without comment.Unless there is a surprise imminent breakthrough, Italy will go back to elections, with most major parties calling for the president to dissolve parliament and hold a vote as soon as July 29. In such a case,  President Mattarella would still have the constitutional right to refuse to appoint any minister suggested by a potential coalition government.      Investors have been dumping Italian government bondsImpact on Britain\u0027s economy?Britain is not in the eurozone and UK banks have already reduced their exposure to Italy, so the impact is limited, for now. However, the FTSE 100 has been pummelled, with £25 billion wiped off the value of the blue chip index on Tuesday.Italy abandoning the euro would also be bad for Europe as a whole as it would be likely to trigger a financial crisis in one of the continent\u0027s biggest economies.The pound would normally benefit from a continental crisis as investors flock to safe haven assets, but since the Brexit vote the pound has fallen out of favour and has moved up only marginally against the euro.Political implications for the UK?Analysts fear that the Euroscepticism of the League Party and Five Star Movement could ultimately spill over into a Brexit-like disaster where Italy not only crashes out of the single currency but also out of the EU.But that is a long way off and Britain has its own political crisis brewing. Theresa May\u0027s Conservative Party is yet to ink a Brexit transition deal or give any indication whatsoever of how it plans to honour its pledge to deliver the \u0027exact same\u0027 benefits of EU membership from outside the bloc.What are the experts saying?Some believe that a full blown crisis is under way.

Now, for the first time, we can reveal the true cost of paying in sterling overseas.Are you bills about to rise? Some energy customers face bill...My partner and I are planning a trip to Japan next spring,...Get more for your holiday money: The best debit and credit...Share this articleIn an experiment run by Starling Bank, identical twins Heidi and Alice, 29, travelled to Berlin for a weekend. They made exactly the same purchases and both used the same debit card, which charges no extra fees for spending abroad.The only difference was that each time they used their cards, Heidi paid in the local currency, euros, whereas Alice paid in pounds.          Alice (pictured above) and Heidi carried out seven transactions and in each case it was more expensive to pay in pounds           For every transaction, it worked out more expensive to pay in pounds.In the worst case, the difference was almost 10 per cent — which means you would lose £100 if you spent £1,000 over the course of your holiday.Most restaurants, shops and cash machines overseas give tourists the option to pay in sterling — this is known as dynamic currency conversion. It can be tempting as it means you’ll be able see straight away how much the transaction will cost you in pounds and pence. But the conversion rates used by foreign firms almost always work out as more expensive than if you had paid in the local currency and left it to your own bank or credit card provider to convert the cost.UK banks typically use the exchange rate offered by Visa or Mastercard, which is as near to a perfect rate as you can get.In this experiment, Alice and Heidi, who live in South East London, carried out seven transactions and in each case it was more expensive to pay in pounds. Even in the best cases, the extra cost of paying in pounds was still 3.1 per cent of the total bill.The worst offender was a cash machine at Berlin airport, where both twins withdrew €200. Heidi chose to be charged in euros, which worked out as £177.44 at the Mastercard exchange rate.          The research showed that even if your debit or credit card charges a fee on spending overseas, it would still work out cheaper to pay in the local currencyAlice, on the other hand, accepted the offer to convert the €200 to pounds there and then using the foreign bank’s rate. This ended up costing her £195.18 — an extra £17.74 or 10 per cent.When the sisters later split a €43.86 bill for cocktails at their hotel, the difference was far smaller. Heidi paid her €21.93 bill in euros, which worked out at £19.45. Alice paid in pounds, costing her £20.06 — an extra 61p or 3.1 per cent.The next day, the twins went shopping and each bought a scarf, a pair of trainers and a top from three different stores. Heidi paid in euros, spending €7.95, €69.10 and €9.99 — which worked out at £7.05, £61.30 and £8.86 respectively.Alice again converted her bills to pounds and ended up paying £7.28, £63.31 and £9.15. So altogether she paid an extra £2.53.After lunch — where, unusually, they weren’t offered the option of paying in pounds — they visited the Museum of Berlin, which had a €12 entry fee. Accepting the on-the-spot conversion cost Alice £11.05, while Heidi paid only £10.64.Finally, at the airport the following morning, the twins bought some €12.50 chocolates from a duty-free shop. Heidi, as usual, paid in euros, which later worked out at £11.09. After agreeing to pay in pounds, the chocolates cost Alice £11.70 — an extra 61p or 5.5 per cent.In many of these examples the difference between paying in pounds and euros is just a few pence. But over the course of a holiday this can add up. In fact, the rip-off is estimated to cost British tourists around £500million every year, according to travel money firm FairFX.At the end of the Berlin trip, Alice had spent a total of £317.73 — an extra £21.90 compared to Heidi.While this isn’t an enormous sum, it is an easy saving to make — all it requires is that you push a different button on the card machine. Experts say that some businesses are failing to give tourists a choice and automatically convert the bill into pounds.A spokesman for Starling Bank says: ‘This isn’t always intentional as sometimes shop assistants or waiting staff don’t understand and presume they are doing their customers a favour by selecting to pay in pounds for them. But in line with the law, cardholders should be given a choice before they pay.’Starling Bank’s research also showed that even if your debit or credit card charges a typical 2.99 per cent fee on spending overseas, it would still work out cheaper to pay in the local currency. FairFX is offering This is Money readers a free prepaid Mastercard currency exchange card.

Car insurance policies can be as long as 38,336 words, and travel insurance up to 39,550.Martyn James, a consumer expert who has worked for the Financial Ombudsman Service, says: ‘Insurance exists to cover you for the unexpected events that can occur in life.‘But Money Mail’s investigation has clearly shown that there are countless occasions when unclear or unfair contract terms are used to avoid paying out a claim — this practice undermines the whole industry.’An analysis of cases that went before the independent dispute service for insurance claims, the Financial Ombudsman, found that some insurers refuse to pay out when a burglar has not used ‘force and violence’ to gain entry to the customer’s property.It means that unless thieves break a window or kick down the door, insurers will reject claims — even if the customer had locked the doors and windows and the burglar picked the lock.          Obscure loopholes are being used by insurers to avoid paying out, our investigation has foundIn one case last year, Royal \u0026amp Sun Alliance (RSA) declined a couple’s home insurance claim after police said it was likely the burglars had used a skeleton key to get into the property, leaving no evidence of forced entry.A spokesman for RSA says: ‘In this instance, there was no settlement as the cover terms within the customer’s policy were not met by the claim.’Meanwhile, some insurers refuse claims if customers have the wrong type of locks on windows and doors. In February, for example, one man was refused a payout following a break-in because thieves entered a ground-floor window that was on a latch.His insurer, LV, claimed he had not complied with the security conditions of his policy, which stated that all his windows must have key-operated locks. A spokesman for LV says the requirement had been explained verbally and in the customer’s policy documents.Put your question to our team of independent experts. Click the more button to email usMoney Mail’s investigation also found that some motor insurers refuse to pay out if a customer’s car is stolen by a thief posing as a potential buyer, or if the spare key is kept in the car — even if it is locked out of sight.In a case referred to the Ombudsman, the thief posing as a buyer had asked the owner of the car if he could take it for a test drive. The owner refused and offered to drive himself.He later agreed to switch places with the ‘buyer’ but, as soon as he opened the door to get out, the thief made off with the car.When the owner reported the incident to his insurer, Advantage, his claim was rejected. The firm says that the policy excluded cover for ‘loss or damage to your car where possession of it is gained by deception of someone who claims to be a buyer or agent’.Travel insurers, meanwhile, may turn down claims for medical expenses incurred overseas if they don’t think that the treatment was ‘essential’. In one case, a man was told by a doctor that he needed surgery after snapping a tendon in his heel while on holiday.However, his insurer, Aviva, said that it didn’t think it was ‘medically necessary’ to have the surgery abroad and wanted to repatriate him back to the UK for treatment. When he went ahead with the operation regardless, Aviva refused to cover the cost.          Some home insurance policies are as long as 41,097 words, according to insurance ratings agency Fairer Finance. Car insurance policies can be as long as 38,336 words, and travel insurance up to 39,550Aviva says that its travel insurance policies only cover treatment overseas if it cannot wait until the customer returns to the UK and that this is detailed in the policy terms and conditions.It adds that it had paid to get the customer home after the surgery. Martyn James says: ‘It isn’t right that customers are expected to challenge a medical professional when they are distressed and in a foreign country where they don’t speak the language.’Travel and health insurers may also refuse claims if they discover customers have not declared GP visits and physio appointments — even if they occurred years ago and the customer was never diagnosed with a condition.In one case seen by the Ombudsman, a man was refused cover after he was admitted to hospital with severe back pain caused by an extruded disc hernia. Axa discovered that he had been to his GP with back and leg pain two months prior to travelling.Yet, despite the fact that he was only told to take over-the-counter medication and to self-refer for physiotherapy, Axa said he was not covered for claims arising from any medical condition for which he’d been prescribed medication or received treatment within six months of booking the trip.However, the Ombudsman said that it was not reasonable for Axa to expect the customer to notify his insurer of the GP visit when he had not experienced a significant change in health.Axa says it accepted the ruling and has paid the claim. Some travel insurers also try to reject claims where the customer has had alcohol, even though the incident was unrelated. And others will use completely unrelated health issues or injuries to avoid paying out.In one instance, a woman had failed to declare a trip to the GP about pins and needles 14 years before she was being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.When she made a claim on her critical illness policy, her insurer, Prudential, turned it down on the grounds of ‘non-disclosure’, as pins and needles can be an early symptom of the condition.But the insurer was later ordered by the Ombudsman to pay out.Prudential says it is ‘extremely rare’ for it not to pay a critical illness claim and adds that it is sorry for the distress caused.James Daley, founder of Fairer Finance, says: ‘It seems that, as the pressure to set fairer prices increases, insurers are trying to reduce costs by wriggling out of as many claims as possible. Examples such as these, where insurers reject claims on a technicality, are toxic.‘Firms should be forced to flag major exclusions in big red letters before customers sign up.’A spokesman for industry trade body the Association of British Insurers says: ‘Insurers want to pay all claims and continually strive to make all customer communications as clear and simple as possible.‘Insurance is ultra-competitive and, when shopping around, it is vital that people assess their needs and check the cover to ensure that it best meets their requirements.’ £43 for 18 monthsOne year fixed rate£20 in M\u0026S points after first purchaseDouble points for a year£150 to switch, £50 to stay"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/22/4CBCE1D900000578-5784335-image-a-37_1527627607984.jpg","title":"New York Times writer trolls Prescot Journalists article labels town casualty austerity","story":"    Prescot\u0027s new fire and police station.

I’ve already knocked down your claims. Enough said.’ Others joined the lengthy spat on Twitter, accusing the writer of spreading fake news. One man tweeted: ‘Shhhh.

About 15,000 people live in the area.Centuries ago, cotton was manufactured there, but the industry died out.

This rose to 78 per cent in \u0027areas that report having experience large-scale migration in recent years\u0027.Nearly half, 47 per cent, felt that protecting British values should take priority over multiculturalism. And 55 per cent said the Government is doing too little to promote traditional British values. This thinking was common among Tory supporters and those who voted to leave the EU, but was also the most popular view among Labour and Remain voters.The Demos report said: \u0027Only three issues appear to truly unite the nation – the belief that the country is in a state of decline and that further change lies on the horizon, feeling that immigration has negatively impacted British society, and believing the nation\u0027s cultures and traditions are not being sufficiently defended and promoted.\u0027 Lord Green of Deddington, head of the Migration Watch UK pressure group, said: \u0027It is absolutely the case that very few people appear to have been sticking up for the culture and traditions of our own country.

Terrified shoppers flee as...Share this article‘But, from the first day he joined the school, it became evident that he had a talent for football that was way beyond his years.’Thirteen years and 37 England caps later, Raheem Shaquille Sterling’s success on the football pitch continues to be as stratospheric as his all-too-regular failures off it.          Sterling, pictured here with his girlfriend Paige Lee Hansel, is part of Gareth Southgate\u0027s squad to travel to Russia next month for the World CupOn one hand, the rise of the 23-year-old star represents an old-fashioned sporting fairy tale: a working-class boy who came to the UK as an infant and, through talent and hard graft, has achieved fame and fortune beyond the wildest dreams of his immigrant single mother.A key figure in Manchester City’s title-winning season, scoring 18 goals in the process, the £200,000-a-week forward will be cheered by a nation when he takes the field at the coming World Cup.Yet, on the other hand, this supposed role model has for far too long allowed himself to be defined by acute lapses in judgment that — in the eyes of many critics, at least — have turned him into a symbol of the amorality that is today at the heart of the so-called Beautiful Game.Recent years have seen court appearances, at least one reported tryst with a prostitute and secret dates with a Playboy model who was most certainly not Paige Lee Hansel, the long-suffering fiancee and mother of his youngest child Thiago.  Sterling has been photographed taking \u0027Hippy Crack\u0027, left, and with a shisha pipe, rightOn social media, where he shares images and videos of his gaudy mansion in Cheshire, purchased for £3.1 million in 2016, high-end cars (he’s said to own seven — one for each day of the week) and collection of bling wristwatches, he’s also been filmed smoking and inhaling a mind-altering intoxicant known as ‘hippy crack.’In this ignoble tradition came yesterday’s somewhat bizarre controversy over Sterling’s decision to get a large new tattoo — of an M16 assault rifle.He showed off the design, running down the lower half of his right leg, in a photo shared with his 3.6 million followers on Instagram on Monday.It was taken at England’s training ground in Staffordshire as players assembled to start preparations for the World Cup, which begins in just over a fortnight.Critics promptly condemned it as provocative and irresponsible, pointing out that more than 60 people have been killed by gun and knife violence in London this year alone and that similar weapons have been used in countless recent mass shootings in the U.S.Branding it ‘sickening’, ‘disgusting’ and ‘totally unacceptable’, the lobby group Mothers Against Guns called for him to be dropped from the England side.Lucy Cope, whose son was shot dead outside a London club, said: ‘He’s supposed to be a role model, but chooses to glamorise guns.’Last night, her words were echoed by the father of Damilola Taylor, who was stabbed to death in a street attack aged ten.Richard Taylor told The Sun: ‘Young people look up to footballers. Sterling hasn’t displayed the discipline we expect. He should be reprimanded and made to apologise to victims’ families.’Iffat Rizvi, who runs the Starr anti-guns campaign, said: ‘This is disrespectful to young people who lost their lives.’      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/17/1EE3252000000578-0-image-m-63_1527609689005.jpg","title":"Royal Sophie launches foul mouthed defence disgraced Kids Company founder","story":"    Actress Sophie Winkleman (pictured with husband Lord Frederick Windsor), Prince Michael of Kent\u0027s daughter-in-law, launched a foul-mouthed defence of the colourful former charity boss Camila BatmanghelidjhLady Frederick Windsor tells me: \u0027They don\u0027t tell the truth.

Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.\u0027 It appears the cancellation of the show will also affect the cast\u0027s Emmy prospects, as ABC revealed it is suspending the show\u0027s FYC (For Your Consideration) campaign. Other networks including Viacom also dropped reruns of the original Roseanne as the industry turned its back on the show and its star performer. The swift fallout from the tweet began when Wanda Sykes  quit her role as the show\u0027s consulting producer and celebrities condemned Barr\u0027s words.   Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, also revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled. \u0027I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed.

We must stand up against bias, hatred, bigotry, and ignorance to make society a better place for all.\u0027  Many called on ABC to fire Barr or drop the show as others criticized the broadcast network for its enduring silence amid recent controversies with the comedian.Others were skeptical that ABC would dare touch the hit series, which is the third highest-rated show this year following Sunday Night Football and This Is Us.The revival of Roseanne was a ratings juggernaut when it premiered on ABC to a whopping 25 million viewers in April.It\u0027s surprising success even elicited a congratulatory phone call and tweet from President Donald Trump. Ratings dropped steadily thereafter, with last week\u0027s season finale garnering 10.33 million viewers.ABC  initially ordered 13 episodes for the second season and said the show would move away from its controversial politics and focus on family.          Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim, despite there being no supporting evidence           Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski          When one user called Barr\u0027s tweet racist, she proclaimed that \u0027Muslims r NOT a race\u0027           Roseanne later tweeted, in an attempt to defend her controversial joke, that \u0027Islam is not a race\u0027          She also retweeted an article with the headline: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027The show most recently came under fire for featuring an episode in which Barr\u0027s character believes her new Muslim neighbors are terrorists. Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 in her Tuesday tweet seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim. Jarrett, who was Obama\u0027s senior adviser during his presidency, was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz for six years. The family had moved to Iran because her father was part of a program that sent American physicians to help developing countries. He ran a children\u0027s hospital.There has never been any indication that Jarrett or her parents are Muslim.  Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski. \u0027ABC is doing their best to ignore some of these statements from Roseanne and she is making it really hard for them by taking it to the next level here,\u0027 he wrote. After Roseanne responds, Kaczynski replied: \u0027understand it\u0027s a joke, but can you see why some people think comparing a black woman to Planet of the Apes might be racist and find the Muslim Brotherhood reference to be conspiratorial and Islamophobic?\u0027  \u0027Child rapist\u0027 left covered in blood after violent attack by mobOfficer punches bikini-clad girl in the head during arrestChilling moment man is arrested for murdering his partnerEDL founder Tommy Robinson arrested by police outside courtCar enthusiast breaks John O\u0027Groats to Land\u0027s End land speed recordBlack woman rants at Jewish man as he calls her racist on NY metroCaravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overShocking moment bus crash leaves dozens of vehicles destroyed    A number of stars have since condemned Barr for the tweet, including Patricia Arquette and Julianne Moore. Rev Al Sharpton used ABC to fire Barr, while Rosie O\u0027Donnell defended her          Not everyone was happy with ABC\u0027s decision to cancel the show. Some stood by in their support for Barr, while others said the network should have continued without her A number of celebrities  also condemned Barr for the tweet, with some urging ABC to fire her from the show completely.\u0027I am repulsed that Valerie Jarret had that racist and bigoted \u0027joke\u0027 made at her expense and I am sickened that any Black or Muslim person has to keep hearing this sickness in 2018,\u0027 Patricia Arquette tweeted. \u0027You can take @RoseanneOnABC out of racism but you can\u0027t take the racism out of @therealroseanne,\u0027 Don Cheadle wrote. \u0027I told y\u0027all about Roseanne. I told you. So,\u0027 author Roxane Gay added, to which Julianne Moore replied: \u0027Yes you did. #FireRoseanne.\u0027 Reverend Al Sharpton also criticized the comedian and called on ABC to \u0027take action now\u0027. \u0027The comparison by Rosanne Barr on ABC of Former Obama aide, Valerie Jarrett to an APE is racist and inexcusable,\u0027 he tweeted. Tomi Lahren was a rare prominent conservative voice to hit out at Roseanne. \u0027What Roseanne said was wrong,\u0027 she tweeted. \u0027I\u0027m sure she knows that.

Which makes it … unusual. If traditional Irish literature was a car, it would have a wide selection of reverse gears, 30 or 40 rear-view mirrors and no headlights. I admire much of Ireland’s brilliant, backward-looking, past-obsessed canon. But other literary traditions use the future: Brave New World, Nineteen Eighty-Four, The Sirens of Titan, A Clockwork Orange, Oryx and Crake, Accelerando, The Power … Irish literature has only recently begun to do this, in books such as Mike McCormack’s Notes from a Coma, Kevin Barry’s City of Bohane, and Sarah Davis-Goff’s forthcoming Last Ones Left Alive. Maybe Ireland needed to escape its own stifling past first, referendum by painful referendum. And so, in 2012, possessed perhaps by the zeitgeist, I began writing Connect. In it, biologist Naomi Chiang, disturbed by the implications of her research, refuses to publish. Her home-schooled, troubled son, Colt, hides from the world inside a virtual reality headset. But Colt secretly sends his mother’s work out into the world the military, and Colt’s father, come hunting them and Naomi and Colt must finally engage with their digitised, militarised, technological times. Connect is essentially a novel of ideas, hidden inside a family drama, and disguised as a techno-thriller. To write it, over what turned out to be seven years of accelerating global change, I needed to understand where the modern technological world came from and where it might be headed. James Joyce, bless him, wasn’t going to help me there.Here are 10 of the books that did help me: they might also help you understand, and survive, our complicated, stressful, digital age.1. Marshall McLuhan Unbound by Marshall McLuhan (2005)The visionary Canadian media analyst predicted the internet, and coined the phrase the Global Village, in the early 1960s. His dense, complex, intriguing books explore how changes in technology change us. This book presents his most important essays as 20 slim pamphlets in a handsome, profoundly physical, defiantly non-digital slipcase.2. Ubik by Philip K Dick (1969)Pure pulp SF pleasure a deep book disguised as a dumb one. Dick shows us, not a dystopia, but a believably shabby, amusingly human future. The everyman hero, Joe Chip, wakes up and argues with his robot toaster, which refuses to toast until he sticks a coin in the slot. Joe can’t do this, because he’s broke. He then has a stand-up row with his robot front door, which won’t open, because he owes it money too … Technology changes: being human, and broke, doesn’t. Warning: Dick wrote Ubik at speed, on speed. But embedded in the pulpy prose are diamonds of imagery that will stay with you for ever.3. The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil (2005)This book is what Silicon Valley has instead of a bible. It’s a visionary work that predicts a technological transformation of the world in our lifetime. Kurzweil argues that computer intelligence will soon outperform human thought. We will then encode our minds, upload them, and become one with our technology, achieving the Singularity. At which point, the curve of technological progress starts to go straight up. Ultimately – omnipotent, no longer mortal, no longer flesh – we transform all the matter in the universe into consciousness into us.4. To Be a Machine by Mark O’Connell (2017)This response to Kurzweil won this year’s Wellcome prize. It’s a short, punchy tour of transhumanism: the attempt to meld our minds with machines, to transcend biology and escape death. He meets some of the main players, and many on the fringes, and listens to them, quizzically. It is a deliberately, defiantly human book, operating in that very modern zone between sarcasm and irony, where humans thrive and computers crash.5. A Visit from the Goon Squad by Jennifer Egan (2011)This intricately structured, incredibly clever novel moves from the 60s right through to a future maybe 15 years from now. It steps so lightly into that future you hardly notice the transition. It has sex and drugs and rock’n’roll, solar farms, social media scams and a stunningly moving chapter written as a PowerPoint presentation. It’s a masterpiece. Life will be like this.6. What Technology Wants by Kevin Kelly (2010)Kelly argues that we scruffy biological humans are no longer driving technological progress. Instead, the technium, “the greater, global, massively interconnected system of technology vibrating around us”, is now driving its own progress, faster and faster, and we are just caught up in its slipstream. As we accelerate down the technological waterslide, there is no stopping now … Kelly’s vision of the future is scary, but it’s fun, and there is still a place for us in it.7. The Meme Machine by Susan Blackmore (1999)Blackmore expands powerfully and convincingly on Richard Dawkins’s original concept of the meme. She makes a forceful case that technology, religion, fashion, art and even our personalities are made of memes – ideas that replicate, mutate and thus evolve over time. We are their replicators (if you buy my novel, you’ve replicated its memes) but memes drive our behaviour just as we drive theirs. It’s a fascinating book that will flip your world upside down.8. Neuromancer by William Gibson (1984)In the early 1980s, Gibson watched kids leaning into the screens as they played arcade games. They wanted to be inside the machines, he realised, and they preferred the games to reality. In this novel, Gibson invented the term cyberspace sparked the cyberpunk movement (to his chagrin) and vividly imagined the jittery, multi-screened, anxious, technological reality that his book would help call into being. 9. You Are Not a Gadget: A Manifesto by Jaron Lanier (2010)Lanier, an intense, brilliant, dreadlocked artist, musician and computer scientist, helped to develop virtual reality. His influential essay Digital Maoism described early the downsides of online collective action. And he is deeply aware that design choices made by (mainly white, young, male) software engineers can shape human behaviour globally. He argues, urgently, that we need to question those choices, now, because once they are locked in, all of humanity must move along those tracks, and we may not like where they take us. Events since 2010 have proved him right. His manifesto is a passionate argument in favour of the inidual voice, the inidual gesture.10. All About Love: New Visions by bell hooks (2000)Not, perhaps, an immediately obvious influence on a near-future techno-thriller in which military drones chase a woman and her son through Las Vegas. But hooks’s magnificent exploration and celebration of love, first published 18 years ago, will be far more useful to us, in our alienated digital future, than the 10,000 books of technobabble published this year. All About Love is an intensely practical roadmap, from where we are now to where we could be. When Naomi and Colt find themselves on the run through a militarised American wilderness of spirit, when GPS fails them, bell hooks is their secret guide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01811636c788459413147728a9c0a56ba9f353fc/145_848_7070_4242/master/7070.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db1a532c11760859f81defe861c0c126","title":"whistle dark emma healey review","story":"A desperate mother seeks to understand why her teenage daughter briefly disappeared in Healey’s follow-up to her Costa award debutIn a world of ever more convoluted plot twists, here’s a true novelty: a mystery novel where the mystery is set up on the first page, and then straightforwardly solved at the end. Emma Healey is the young novelist whose debut, Elizabeth Is Missing, about an elderly woman with dementia, won the Costa first novel award in 2014. The achievement of this follow-up lies its finely drawn motherdaughter pairing and sharp take on the nitty-gritty of contemporary familial relationships.The novel is written in the third person, but we see everything from the point of view of the desperately anxious Jen, who “never seemed to get the reaction she expected from other people. It was as though they didn’t think she was the person she thought she was.” Jen is trying not to put a foot wrong, but detonates bombs wherever she goes. Lana is her intensely strong-willed and utterly miserable daughter, prone to self-harm, who at the beginning of the novel has disappeared for four days and been found again. She is the scariest type of adolescent: scathing, rude, demanding, but underneath it all very sad and frightened.“I look hideous without the bandana,” said Lana.“I’m sure it isn’t that bad.”“You’re disregarding my feelings again. We talked about this with Dr Greenbaum.”Most of the book details Jen’s attempts to coax her teenager into opening up and revealing what has happened during her disappearance. The desperate love of a parent for a child they cannot know is wonderfully true to life, and despite the rather bleak set-up, there are a lot of very funny moments, such as a self-consciously arty artists’ group (which I could have done with rather more of, particularly Peny, “who insisted she could tell if you pronounced her name with two t’s”).

The city showed that it had a well-established record of achieving high environmental standards and had ambitious goals for improving the environment and sustainable development.With such an environmentally sound reputation, there are many jewels in Bristol’s green business crown. Here are 10 companies helping to grow the city’s green economy …RefillRefill launched in Bristol in September 2015 and is now a nationwide scheme. It was started by the people behind the equally environmentally conscious City to Sea, that campaigns to help tackle the problem of plastics in our oceans. Refill aims to bring together businesses, cafes, museums and other public spaces to make water available for the public to refill their own water bottles, reducing the demand for single-use plastics. There is also a Refill app where you can find free water sources nearby and also add your own refill stations.SkipchenSkipchen’s aim is to tackle food waste. In 2014 it ran an extremely successful pop-up cafe in Bristol that repurposed food that discarded by supermarkets and other restaurants that was still perfectly good for eating. It now operates within the community by having conversations about the problems of waste and working with businesses in collecting their surplus. More recently, Skipchen travelled to areas including Lesbos in Greece, working to help feed refugees out of its Food Rescue Ambulance.Bee the ChangeAs part of the Bristol Green Capital Partnership, Bee the Change set up community bee hives around the city that are nurtured and cared for by the community. It also gave educational talks in schools, universities and other organisations to discuss the role of bees in the environment, as well as allowing attendees to extract their own honey. Bee the Change also plants bee forage (their food supply – nectar and pollen from blossoming plants) and builds sanctuaries for local bees. If you’re keen on getting your own beekeeping wings, natural beekeeping courses are available for groups or iniduals.Incredible Edible BristolIncredible Edible launched in Todmorden, Yorkshire, and has since spread as far as Canada, New Zealand … and Bristol too. It works hard to encourage locals to take advantage of whatever land they have, and nurture it to grow their own food. Thanks to the Bristol team, there are now 30 edible gardens scattered across the city – in parks, on street corners and even in station car parks – that are cared for by volunteers. It’s available for anyone to take away and use to make delicious meals – think herbs and easily grown veg.Grow BristolWhen you think of farming you probably think of huge expanses of fields, tractors and endless countryside. Well, Grow Bristol is here to make you think differently, through urban farming. The urban farming enterprise is developing innovative and sustainable ways to grow food in the city to benefit the people who live there, and has won awards for its work. It supplies greens and other produce to organisations including Farmdrop, who deliver local produce, and Source food hall and cafe, as well as local restaurants.The Severn ProjectAlthough it has a similar model of sustainable food growing as Grow Bristol and Incredible Edible, the Severn Project also helps support people who are recovering from addiction and other mental health issues, and assists ex-offenders by helping them return to employment. Currently, the Severn Project grows produce such as spinach and micro herbs in 1.5 acres of polytunnels, where it also harvests rainwater.Zero GreenIf you’re trying to avoid buying products with excess plastic packaging, it can be tricky finding suitable produce in your local supermarket. Zero Green is Bristol’s first waste-free food shop: customers bring their own containers and bags to fill up with everyday items such as rice and pasta, washing powder and shampoo. The shop is even fitted out with reclaimed wood from the Bristol Wood Recycling Project, which goes to show how well the eco-community in Bristol works together.Bristol Wood Recycling ProjectThe Bristol Wood Recycling Project wants to make sure no wood goes to waste. It reclaims unused wood and provides affordable wood to the community through a small range of furniture and budget firewood and kindling. The project also fosters a community of volunteers who work at the yard.Real Wrap Co.Real Wrap Co. is an environmentally friendly sandwich company that supplies local universities and other big contracts. It produces about 100,000 products a week, but sends almost zero food waste to landfill. It was featured on Channel 4’s Food Unwrapped for being one of the first sandwich companies in the UK to supply leftover bread for the making of beer, to help cut waste.To find out more about how you can support green energy and save money on your bills, visit bristol-energy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d81045715a25cc7b7b9f18b4c18bb7404b863445/0_230_4952_2972/master/4952.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e815ff7902dce51e1480ca3ae08c4931","title":"european markets set to open lower on italian political turmoil business live","story":"Wall Street and Asia fall sharply as investors fear new elections could bring further uncertainty to ItalyDon’t tell Donald Trump, but the latest US private payroll figures have fallen short of forecasts.Ahead of Friday’s non-farm payrolls, the ADP employment report shows an increase of 178,000 private sector jobs in May, compared to expectations of a 190,000 rise.On top of that, the April number was revised down from 204,000 to 163,000.The surge in German inflation complicates the European Central Bank’s life even further, says ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski:While the Easter Bunny Effect has finally been left behind, German inflation is still heavily affected by seasonal effects. The sharp surge in oil prices in combination with several public holidays and long weekends pushed up energy prices, leisure costs and food prices. Under the surface of (too) many one-off factors, German inflation data still tells a two-sided story: while prices for consumer goods have gradually accelerated in recent months, inflation on services has slowed down and has even been negative for a couple of months for communication and clothing. Where available, core inflation measures at the state levels actually dropped in May.Despite today’s increase in headline inflation, the underlying trend still points to a rather benign picture for inflationary pressure. For the ECB, however, today’s inflation data from Germany gives a foretaste of the increased complications on the road to taper. The still undecided debate on whether the Eurozone economy is in a soft patch or at the start of a protracted downswing, the surge in oil prices and latest political developments in Italy have clearly complicated the ECB’s life. It increasingly looks as if the big question for the ECB is not when to stop QE but rather when to signal an extension of QE. With latest market turmoil and political tensions in Italy, giving some certainty in times of uncertainty could be the ECB’s preferred policy choice. This would be an announcement or at least a very clear hint at QE extension at the June meeting.The biggest rises were in energy and food prices.The figures strengthens the hand of the Bundesbank, which would prefer the ECB to end its QE programme this year and begin raising interest rates, partly to benefit German savers.Here’s our latest report on the day’s political developments in Italy:The head of Italy’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement has rekindled negotiations to form a government, days after a bitter row over the country’s future in the eurozone ended a fledgling deal for populist parties to take power.Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old head of the M5S, Italy’s largest party, indicated on Wednesday he was prepared to compromise on his controversial choice of a eurosceptic economist, Paolo Savona, for finance minister. But he insisted that his pick for prime minister remained political newcomer Giuseppe Conte. In the absence of an agreement between Di Maio , the president of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, and the far right leader Matteo Salvini, Di Maio said he favoured snap elections.“There are two paths ahead. Either we launch the Conte government with a reasonable solution or we vote right away,” he said.Italian markets, which have been hit hard by the political crisis, rallied on the news of a potential new deal, which would at least temporarily put plans for a new election on hold. Despite many markets edging higher, they are nowhere near recovering the Italy-driven losses, and investors have very little appetite for risk at the moment. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: It looked as though we were headed for fresh elections as early as July, with negotiations between Five Star Movement and Lega having failed after President Sergio Mattarella vetoed their choice of Finance Minister. Carlo Cottarelli – a former IMF economist - was tasked with forming a temporary government until further elections are called, ideally next year, but that appears to have failed before it got started. While early elections will arguably be very beneficial to the populist parties, who will cite the rejection of its choice of Finance Minister as evidence of Brussels interference and an abuse of the democratic will of the people, it seems one last attempt to form a government is being discussed. The parties seem unwilling to hold an election in July and have no desire to wait until next year. If a government can be formed that receives the stamp of approval from Mattarella and is therefore seen as not posing a threat to Italy’s place in the eurozone, then this will come as a relief to markets in the near-term. Longer-term risks remain though and both parties will likely use recent events as a platform to drum up opposition to the euro with the end goal of holding its own referendum, something eurozone leaders will understandably fear after the UK result in 2016.Over in Spain, prime minister Rajoy is resisting the idea of stepping down as he prepares to face Friday’s no confidence vote:The Lega party reportedly wants new elections in Italy as soon as possible. Reuters says:Italy’s far-right League party will not block rapid political solutions that would allow the country to handle possible emergencies, but it wants an election as soon as possible, a source from the party said on Wednesday.“At this point, we will not block rapid solutions capable of managing emergencies, but we must let Italians express themselves again as soon as possible,” the source said.The source did not explain what was meant by “emergencies”, though financial markets have been in turmoil over the continuing political uncertainty.Europe is likely to muddle through the current political uncertainty, says Erin Browne, head of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management:Without a swift political solution to the situation in Italy, we believe that the risk-return trade-off for European assets has deteriorated. As things currently stand, we are likely to see a period of heightened volatility in Italian and broader European equities and bonds amid Italian political dynamics and their interactions with ECB policy.That said, we do not see Italian political developments as presenting material systemic risks beyond Europe at this stage. Both populist parties have signalled they will not attempt to leave the Eurozone (and according to the Italian Constitution this would be extremely difficult in any case), even if their desired fiscal policies put them on a collision course with the core of Europe and the ECB.We ultimately expect market and political pressures to constrain these parties, and Europe will find a way to muddle through political uncertainty as it has in the past. Still, we recognize the path to resolution is likely to be bumpy and have downgraded our outlook on European assets to account for recent developments.The Italian bond auction results are in, and it seems to have been a reasonable success although the interest rate is again a high one:The dip in the eurozone sentiment figures shows that even before the Italian turmoil, confidence was not really recovering, says Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING Bank:Much like fidget spinners, euphoria about Eurozone growth and politics is definitely something that stayed in 2017. A few months ago, the sky was the limit for Eurozone sentiment, but now even stabilisation seems like a good result, as analysts expected worse.The months ahead will likely see uncertainty continue as the Italian political crisis could drag on during the summer. As developments towards a new government continue, uncertainty about the Italian stance towards the EU and the euro will prevail. Even though it is very unclear what the next steps will be, markets have clearly woken up from the euro-risk lull that started after the Macron presidential election victory in France last year. This continued uncertainty will weigh on Eurozone growth in the months ahead, and a bounce back to growth rates seen in 2017 seems very difficult. Economic confidence in the eurozone dipped slightly in May, according the European Commission.The economic sentiment index slipped by 0.2 points to 112.5 in the eurozone, but edged up 0.4 points to 112.8 in the wider EU. Consumer confidence in the eurozone was down from 0.3 to 0.2. The commission said:Virtually unchanged consumer confidence (-0.1) was the result of a marked decrease in consumers’ assessment of the future general economic situation, which was counterbalanced by a strong increase in their savings expectations. Views on households’ future financial situation and unemployment remained broadly stable.Meanwhile in Spain, ahead of the no confidence vote facing prime minister Mariano Rajoy:The European Central Bank may call an emergency meeting to discuss Italy sometime this week.“Mario Draghi is obviously following events very closely and will likely call an urgent meeting imminently,” said a source close to a member of the European Central Bank’s governing council.On Tuesday Bank of Italy governor Ignazio Visco warned that the crisis-stricken country is at “very serious risk of losing the irreplaceable asset of trust.” Here’s the OECD’s latest economic outlook:Unemployment will drop to its lowest level since 1980 across the world’s richest nations, but global growth remains dependent on cheap borrowing and government spending, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation \u0026amp Development (OECD) has warned in its latest global economy health check.The rise of tit-for-tat protectionist trade barriers, the return of volatile financial markets, and soaring oil prices also spell trouble for the global economy as it heads towards the 10-year anniversary of the 2008 banking collapse, the OECD said.“The economic expansion is set to continue for the coming two years, and the short-term growth outlook is more favourable than it has been for many years,” said Angel Gurría, secretary general of the OECD, the Paris based thinktank for the world’s 35 richest nations, including the US, Britain, Brazil, Mexico and Russia.“However, the current recovery is still being supported by very accommodative monetary policy, and increasingly by fiscal easing. This suggests that strong, self-sustaining growth has not yet been attained.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b11ab9017cb435a525978913a789e7d5","title":"italy regime change future repressive alliance five star league","story":"Is Italy Europe’s new political laboratory – the country in which liberal democracy changes its hue and sinks below the horizon into populism? The question is legitimate, not only because historians have long established how, in his rise to power, Hitler took Mussolini as a model. And not only because Donald Trump was preceded on to the world stage by Silvio Berlusconi – another unscrupulous tycoon devoid of political experience, unfit for government, and with whom Trump shares more than a few personal traits. Above all the question is legitimate because, in Italy, not one but two populisms have won. Together they command more than half the votes in parliament and were until a few days ago on the verge of forming a government.That talks have now collapsed hardly dissipates the danger. On the contrary, the very fact that these populisms have struck hard at the constitutional powers of the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, shows how determined they are to upend the country’s institutional setup. With new elections, probably in the autumn, the populists are likely to emerge even stronger. But for now Italy is set to be led by a transition government – with no majority.Both populisms raked up support with Europhobic slogans and concepts of a revolt of “the people” against the “elites” – all in the name of an imaginary “direct democracy”. One is the Five Star movement, founded by the comedian Beppe Grillo alongside a prophet of web-based democracy, Roberto Casaleggio. The other is Matteo Salvini’s League – no longer a secessionist party of the north but a far-right party that expresses sympathy for the regimes in Russia and North Korea.They predict an apocalyptic future for a public already frightened of globalisation and impoverished by European austerity policies. These are powerful, aggressive forces that have appeared throughout Europe – but are now, for the first time, ready to call the shots in a country that was a founding member of the European Union and has always been firmly anchored in multilateral and transatlantic alliances.This Italian “double populism” will not renounce its programme, which aims to control the government through a sort of politburo known as the “conciliation committee”, placed wholly under the control of Five Star and the League. It aims to neutralise parliament by making it impossible for lawmakers to switch parties – whereas the freedom of MPs to do so is written into the constitution. Unpopular laws would be submitted to a sort of screening by referendum the same would apply to international treaties, and therefore to all the steps that Italy has taken to be part of the EU and the eurozone\u0026nbsp– even though backtracking on treaties is forbidden by article 75 of the constitution.It all brings to mind what the author Robert Musil called (in his 1943 book, Man Without Qualities) “parallel action”: a world where pseudo reality prevails and governance is useless. But what the populist platform contains is not just reform – it carries, ominously, elements of regime change. The already uncertain liberal profile of Italy’s democracy is set to be disfigured. We will move from a society that is traditionally open and welcoming, with a certain propensity for the good life, to the closed horizons of a country that resembles a corporate, statist and repressive autarchy.The coalition “contract” that these populists want to implement includes not only massive public spending, which would break the budget and push Italy out of EU rules, but also the creation of specific crimes for immigrants and forced mass repatriations, as well as the closure of asylum centres and all Roma camps. The limits of legitimate self-defence are to be extended to include confronting burglars with weapons in hand.This dark shadow stretching over Italy has been given substance because of the collapse of traditional parties in the March general election. The centre-left Democratic party – for long the pivot of the political system – lost half its electoral base, about 5m votes, a million\u0026nbspand a half of which shifted to Five Star. Immediately after that defeat the Democratic party leader, former prime minister Matteo Renzi, announced that it should go straight into opposition, even though it had come second in the election (behind Five Star and ahead of the League).On the other side of the political fence, Berlusconi is trying to get back on track as a statesman with European credentials, strutting around meetings of the mainstream right European People’s party. Yet he’s the one who gave his on-off ally Salvini the go-ahead to enter a coalition with the Five Star movement.The contortions of both parties paved the way for populism. The Democratic party proved unable to move on from Renzi’s leadership, despite a long series of defeats – not least a crushing one in the 2016 referendum on wide-ranging constitutional reform. Forza Italia and the moderate centre-right are tied to the ailing but still hegemonic figure of Berlusconi. On top of that, both mainstream parties did nothing during the campaign but imitate the themes, proposals and styles of the populists, instead of pushing back against them.The crisis threatens Italy with international isolation, and will almost certainly prevent it being part of the lead group in a future two-speed Europe. But the EU will find itself with fewer friends in confronting the selfishness and closed horizons of other xenophobic nationalisms, from central Europe to Austria.The darkness that is falling on Rome will be a test of real democracy. Just as with the obscurantism and fortress mentality of Trump’s America, it will be up to civil society and citizens to oppose the vision and policies of populists and nationalists.

That longed for free cappuccino could be yours. Yesterday’s announcement of JAB Holding’s £1.5bn takeover of the Pret chain was given an extra shot with the news that 12,000 employees worldwide would be getting a £1,000 payment once the deal goes through. It was the icing on the carrot cake.The usually reliable bonhomie of Pret staff does not happen by chance. They do things a bit differently there. People are hired because of their attitude and personality, not on account of their experience in the retail sector. Teams see how potential new recruits shape up, and have some say on whether the new person gets the job permanently.At a time when many are rightly concerned about ever-decreasing job quality and the precariousness of employment, this reminder that there are other ways of managing people is refreshing.But in case you thought I’d drunk the organic Kool Aid, it’s worth pointing out that Pret is not a wildly generous or flawless operation. The company is not an accredited living wage employer. Last month, the Advertising Standards Authority told Pret to stop using the word “natural” to describe all its products, since its bread has as many E numbers in it as a supermarket slice. Last year the company executed a rapid U-turn after initially trying to get teenagers to do unpaid shifts (but with free food!) as part of a work experience scheme. Pret is not a charity. If it were, its new German owners would not have coughed up £1.5bn for it.The impressive ersity of Pret’s staff, reflected in the variety of names and national flags to be found on employees’ badges, may have something to do with the positive vibe the best-run stores display. Spontaneity and informality rule the day. Will Pret ever find it necessary to close down all their branches for an afternoon to run racism awareness training, as Starbucks did this week? It seems unlikely.In fact, as we are encouraged to cower and panic ahead of the inevitable and irresistible march of the robots into almost every workplace in the land, Pret employees remind us that human beings still have quite a lot to offer. They can make nice food and sell it to us efficiently and politely. It is a winning formula.Pret spotted a gap in the lunchtime market and made it its own. It’s not the cheapest deal on the block. Not everyone can afford to go there very often. And while the offer of £1,000 to every employee may sound impressive, it will actually represent only a small added cost of doing the takeover deal. It’s really the equivalent of one of those free cups of coffee some of us have been lucky enough to pick up at Pret over the years.The important lesson from Pret’s success is that a good product that offers decent value for money will sell. And that treating people well at work will more than pay for itself over time. As the management consultant John DiJulius says in his book The Customer Service Revolution: “The best marketing is happy, engaged employees.” We can assume that, as of this morning, Pret’s employees are going to be bit happier and more fully engaged than they were a day or two ago.• Stefan Stern is co-author of Myths of Management and the former director of the High Pay Centre"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdaf17e8e14ea15cb4831c17854ac93df7fb79b2/0_145_3376_2025/master/3376.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24b17d8d3cd69ea33d2fcde7716916ad","title":"raheem sterling media young black men footballer tattoo","story":"Whether it’s his choice of tattoo or the variation in his spending, the message to the England footballer is clear: know your placeIn a little over two weeks, the World Cup finals begin in Russia. You would expect the nation to be concentrating its efforts on over-hyping England’s chances and lauding our potential star players. Instead, some parts seem hell-bent on finding reasons to criticise one of the country’s top prospects, Raheem Sterling.After scoring 18 goals from midfield for the runaway winners of this year’s Premier League, you’d expect Sterling to be one of England’s darlings. At the tender age of 23, he has already represented his country at two tournaments, and played key roles for two of England’s biggest teams, Liverpool and Manchester City. As a player with speed, genuine flair and an eye for goal, Sterling is a rarity in the England setup.But this week, there were calls for him to be dropped from the squad after a gun tattoo was spotted on his right leg. Even after Sterling, whose father was killed in a shooting in Jamaica when he was just two, explained that he was vehemently against guns and that the unfinished tattoo symbolised the ability of his right foot as well as being a tribute to his father, some commentators – including Piers Morgan – were still not ready to back down.Morgan told his 6.5 million Twitter followers that Sterling’s tattoo, which looks like an AR15 assault rifle, was inappropriate because it was the same gun sometimes used in school shootings in the USA. After Sterling posted his response, Morgan said: “Perhaps he should explain it better then. Because I fail to see why tattooing an assault rifle on your leg does anything to combat gun violence.”Even when it was pointed out that Morgan’s beloved Arsenal is nicknamed “the Gunners”, has a cannon on its club crest and was founded by munition workers, he was still trying to dictate what kind of tattoos the young footballer should wear on his skin. “Here’s an idea: Stick a big X across that assault rifle tattoo \u0026amp the words ‘NO TO GUNS’. Then it works how I presume you intended it to work. At the moment, it looks like you’re glamourising gun use.”Readers of the Sun, which often leads the charge against Sterling, are predominantly working class, so the stories read more like cautionary warnings on the sorts of behaviour that should be frowned upon. The paper encourages its readers to resent Sterling’s wealth while rarely challenging the money and behaviour of the established middle classes.After the latest story broke and Sterling received overwhelming support, the Sun, which has form for annoying football fans, attempted to immunise itself from allegations of racism by doubling down. Richard Taylor, whose son Damilola died back in 2000 after being attacked on the streets in Peckham, south London, was quoted: “Footballers need to be aware kids look up to them. He must apologise to the families of gun victims.”But even the Sun’s choice in approaching Taylor for comment shows their muddled thinking on black communities. Damilola’s tragic death happened after he was attacked and fell on to some broken glass. It had nothing to do with gun violence. I can imagine someone at the Sun lamenting they had no more current contacts with families of those who have died from actual gun violence in the UK, and then shrugging and saying to themselves, “Well, close enough”.For Sterling, this latest “controversy” must have been met with an air of resignation. The young player is rarely out of the newspapers for some perceived misdemeanour or other. As a lifelong Liverpool fan, I may have been disappointed by the way he left the club, but the treatment he gets from the press seems relentless and unjustified. He was called greedy for asking to be paid relative to his skills while at Liverpool. He was called obscene for spending too much money when he did up his mum’s house, buying her a fancy sink. Then he is criticised for being too frugal when he shops at Primark, Poundland, Greggs or when he flies on a budget airline. He has been criticised for smoking a shisha pipe and inhaling nitrous oxide from balloons, when both activities are legal. He has even been criticised for not keeping his expensive car clean enough.When these criticisms are viewed together, the pattern seems clear: Raheem has money now and some parts of the media don’t like how he spends it. They will talk about “his character” but really they just seem to think he’s a bit too flash and isn’t humble enough (although the stories about him liking pasties and pound shops would seem to indicate otherwise). Almost every story about him references his birth in Jamaica, his humble upbringing in northwest London and his relatively new wealth. They are thinly veiled attacks on all confident, working-class and yes, black young men who appear not to know their place.When Stormzy has the cheek to comment on Grenfell or when Mario Ballotelli gives money to a homeless person they are not pleasing some middle-class commentators. The subtext seems to be, “your talents may have earned you some cash, but don’t get uppity – know your place”.When Morgan was warned that his attacks on Sterling might impact on the star’s World Cup performance, he replied: “Oh Pur-lease. We fail at World Cups because we don’t play well enough. If you can’t stand a bit of media scrutiny, go and be a dustman.” The routes out of poverty are very scarce for the young, working-class black man. Sport, music and entertainment do provide a path for the select few. The narrative reserved for those who make it, though, often sounds a lot like, “We have let you in, now don’t do anything that makes us regret it”.• Maurice Mcleod is a social commentator and director of Media Diversified"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd26689cb7616dc5620dedb710f39cf11ac10cc1/214_77_2489_1494/master/2489.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10a1d19a5af63504465a1946258ae679","title":"roseanne barr tweet valerie jarrett ape","story":"Network pulls Barr’s revived show and condemns racist tweets towards ex-Obama adviser Valerie JarrettRoseanne Barr’s revived sitcom has been cancelled after she posted a racist and Islamophobic tweet that attacked former Obama White House adviser Valerie Jarrett.The sitcom star falsely alleged that Jarrett, who was born in Iran to American parents, has connections to the Muslim Brotherhood, and compared her to an ape. Barr wrote: “Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a babyvj,” using Jarrett’s initials.ABC swiftly announced the show’s cancellation. The network said in a statement: “Roseanne’s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show.”Bob Iger, the chief executive of Disney, which owns ABC, supported the decision. Iger wrote on Twitter: “There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.”In Australia, Network Ten announced it was pulling the sitcom from both of its channels, saying it was “appalled and disgusted” by Barr’s tweet.Barr, one of Donald Trump’s most high-profile supporters, apologized for the post as outrage grew, and announced she’d be quitting Twitter. She also deleted the tweet.Barr was replying to a post from a user that accused Jarrett, a long-serving adviser to the president, of covering up the Obama administration’s alleged “misdeeds”.When a Twitter user told Barr that her tweet was offensive and racist – Jarrett is African American – Barr responded by writing: “Muslims r NOT a race.” Shortly after, Barr reiterated her stance in another post: “ISLAM is not a RACE, lefties. Islam includes EVERY RACE of people.”Barr later apologized. She wrote: “I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans. I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me – my joke was in bad taste.”In a second statement she said: “Today my words caused hundreds of hardworking people to lose their jobs. I sincerely apologise to the audience that has embraced my work for decades.”Barr tweeted throughout the night, at one point asking her followers not to defend her actions.MSNBC reported that Jarrett received a call from Iger before news broke of the cancellation. “This should be a teaching moment,” she said. Jarrett responded later on Tuesday during a town hall on race hosted by the cable news channel, saying she believed ABC made the right decision in canceling Barr’s television show.“I’m fine,” she said at the event titled Everyday Racism in America. “I’m worried about all the people out there who don’t have a circle of friends and followers coming to their defense,” she said. “The person who’s walking down the street minding their own business and they see somebody cling to their purse or walk across the street. Or every black parent I know who has a boy who has to sit down and have a conversation, ‘the talk’ as we call it.” “Those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day,” Jarrett said. The White House declined to offer a reaction from the president, who earlier this year personally called Barr to congratulate her on the show’s ratings.Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters aboard Air Force One there were “a lot bigger things going on in the country right now”, while adding that Trump was focused on negotiations with North Korea.Barr’s tweets sparked condemnation from many prominent figures, including one of the sitcom’s consulting producers, Wanda Sykes, who announced that she would not be returning for the proposed second season.Barr’s co-star Sara Gilbert, who plays Darlene, condemned the tweets as “abhorrent”. Gilbert wrote: “Roseanne’s recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least.”The 65-year-old Barr has been in the public eye recently after her eponymous sitcom returned after a two-decade hiatus. The now-cancelled show was ABC’s most-watched “new” series, averaging almost 18 million viewers per episode. In the show, Roseanne Conner plays a working-class Trump supporter, but Barr herself has not been shy about her allegiance to the president, frequently engaging with his critics online and peddling conspiracy theories shared by Trump’s base, such as “Pizzagate”, “Pedogate” and theories about the murder of former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich.Barr also retweeted a post comparing Clinton to Donkey from Shrek.After Clinton replied with a tweet of her own, Barr apologized in sarcastic fashion. “Sorry to have tweeted incorrect info about you!,” she wrote, again invoking Soros, a frequent target of Trump and the right. “I Please forgive me! By the way, George Soros is a nazi who turned in his fellow Jews 2 be murdered in German concentration camps \u0026amp stole their wealth-were you aware of that? But, we all make mistakes, right Chelsea?”A spokesperson for Soros called the tweet “an affront”.After her tweets and the outrage that followed, Barr announced she was quitting the site. “I apologize,” she wrote. “I am now leaving Twitter.”News of Roseanne’s cancellation was met with cautious positivity in Hollywood. Actor and comedian Kumail Nanjiani tweeted: “I’m glad Roseanne is canceled. The backlash to its cancellation is going to be a deafening nightmare. Nothing good has come of this entire thing.”Bruce Helford, the Roseanne show’s executive producer and showrunner, said he was “horrified” by the comments. Barr has also been dropped by her agency ICM Partners, which stated that her tweet was “antithetical to our core values”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/780a9dc5bb3b4289bbc619faaee26fd5c608318f/0_458_4704_2822/master/4704.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06192c09c76eeb91b3358bfba570df46","title":"vivid 2018 shows sydney in new light in pictures","story":"Vivid Sydney is an annual festival that places light sculptures and installations throughout the city.

She rose from the table and drove us to the nearby grasslands of Patagonia national park, gushing about the possibility of staying up all night with a torch in hope of spying a mountain lion come to feast on the dead llama-like creature.Tompkins searched the golden hillsides for the 100kg carcass she had spotted hours earlier. Had lions dragged it into the underbrush? Were the Andean condors circling above preparing to finish off the remains? As she drove, Tompkins narrated her quarter century-long effort to reintroduce threatened and locally extinct species to the wilds of South America – ranging from giant anteaters and jaguars in northern Argentina to Darwin’s rhea, a species of ostrich native to southern Patagonia. When Conservación Patagónica – the NGO she helped found – bought the land that became this park, the guanaco population was struggling to compete for food and space with an estimated 25,000 sheep. But since the sheep were sold and the fences removed, native guanaco herds have flourished from an unsustainable population of several hundred to an estimated 3,000.After purchasing a 222,000-acre property in 2004, Tompkins and her partner Doug, who died in a kayak accident in 2015, dedicated the following years to their conservation effort. Using hundreds of volunteers, Conservación Patagónica has converted these overgrazed sheep ranchlands into a world-renowned example of ecological restoration by reintroducing and breeding native species as part of a comprehensive rewilding programme. First coined in the 1990s by environmental activist Dave Foreman, rewilding – large-scale wilderness recovery that allows natural processes and native wildlife to flourish – has migrated from fringe fantasy to the mainstream of conservation biology. Scientists increasingly believe the complex web of life thrives in the absence of human intervention and is often heavily influenced by mountain lions, wolves and other “apex predators”.Tompkins, a former CEO of clothing company Patagonia, and her late husband, who made his fortune from founding clothing companies The North Face and Esprit, have contributed $170m to the rewilding, along with an estimated $45m from philanthropists around the globe. By purchasing vast tracts of wildlands in both Chile and Argentina, the Tompkinses initiated conservation projects that have added more than 11m acres to the national parks systems of those countries. Their strategy of purchasing land, removing livestock and fencing, and reintroducing extinct species or reinforcing populations of threatened ones has become a laboratory – if not a model – for rewilding worldwide.“Compared to South America, with a lot of wildlands left, in Europe it is much more about restoring natural processes in large landscapes to let wilder nature develop,” said Frans Schepers, managing director of Rewilding Europe. “In Europe, the rewilding movement has large areas in which there has been a successful comeback of wolves to Germany, elk to Denmark, Iberian lynx to Spain and bison to central and eastern Europe.” Scotland’s highlands, in particular, are being restored by landowners seeking not only to help re-establish missing native species but to replant the majestic Caledonian forest, lost centuries ago to logging and sheep that have grazed the land to a nearly unrecognisable shell of its former lush existence. In 1989, the conservationist Alan Watson Featherstone founded Trees for Life, a charity that has since planted more than a million trees in Scotland. Scottish rewilding efforts also include the restoration of peat bogs and efforts to cull the red deer population, which has swelled beyond what biologists consider a healthy population – due largely to the absence of predators including wolves which once ranged widely across Scotland.Across Europe a movement is taking shape, with Rewilding Europe coordinating projects in 10 countries. “We not only need to protect nature, but also to restore it and provide space for nature to develop. Many ecosystems – the basis of our natural wealth – are broken,” said Schepers. “Even in Europe we can allow nature to take more of its own course, instead of people managing and controlling it.”Cristian Saucedo, a veterinarian and head of the wildlife conservation programme at Patagonia national park, described rewilding as “a moral issue to avoid extinction. We are not just losing species, we are reducing our own chances for survival in the long term.” Pointing to the resurgence of mountain lions in the park, Saucedo said: “We are not just preserving landscape and wildlife, but also clean water, forests, and functional ecosystems. If we don’t have top predators, the population of guanacos explodes, and this affects the grass. We are all related. The problem with humans is that we are now so far removed from nature.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8240c9dfccaddc42f6f596816014c4e8b9f22d59/0_14_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f31537ef38873a50ba17ff266ef001f9","title":"best alternative films summer guardian","story":"While the multiplex might be overrun with superheroes, dinosaurs and space cowboys, the season also offers up a set of films untouched by sequelitisOn paper, Hearts Beat Loud might tick off a few too many twee Sundance-friendly boxes, but there’s something disarmingly likable about what actually lies underneath. Parks and Recreation’s Nick Offerman stars as the owner of a failing record store in Brooklyn whose resistance to change is driving his business into the ground. His daughter, played by Dope’s Kiersey Clemons, is one summer away from med school and the impending move is already starting to sting. As a way of bringing them together before they’re torn apart, he reinstates an old tradition: a jam session with the pair using their musical talents to create new music. It’s a warm-hearted little film that mostly avoids preciousness thanks to a strong central pairing, a niftily assembled supporting cast (Toni Collette, Ted Danson, Blythe Danner, American Honey’s Sasha Lane) and some great music.Oscar buzz doesn’t typically swirl around horror films but then not many of them star Toni Collette, who scored a nomination for her role as a struggling mother in 1999’s The Sixth Sense. She’s gaining buzz for another matriarchal role, this time in even darker territory as a woman dealing with the death of her mother and the effect it has on her fractured family. It’s a film that’s already invited comparison to The Exorcist with horrified Sundance audiences calling it one of the scariest for some time. It’s a difficult, tonally severe, often audaciously shocking film about the unbearable weight of grief and the inescapability of familial sin that will ide audiences upon release.With his ominous, stylish breakout It Follows, director David Robert Mitchell announced himself as a rare horror talent, squeezing scares from every scene of his high-concept nightmare. Rather than continue to show off his genre prowess, his follow-up takes him into an entirely different part of town, specifically Los Angeles, for a neo-noir comedy thriller. It stars Andrew Garfield as a drifter searching for a mysterious young woman, played by Riley Keough, and stumbling on a much larger conspiracy. The film has confounded, frustrated and intrigued critics at its Cannes premiere: some hated it (the ’s Peter Bradshaw gave it one star and called it “catastrophically boring”) and some loved it (Time Out’s Joshua Rothkopf gave it five stars and called it “hypnotic”). Since director Debra Granik broke out with 2010’s soulful drama Winter’s Bone, her output has been minimal (just 2014’s little-seen documentary Stray Dog) so expectations were high for her narrative return at this year’s Sundance. The result is another stark study of working-class America, this time centering on a father and daughter, played by Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie, who are surviving in the wilderness. But when authorities get involved, their fragile existence is in jeopardy. It’s a delicate, naturalistic film that might not be as accessible as Winter’s Bone but again proves that Granik is a measured and empathetic humanist.Falling into the increasingly populated subgenre of documentaries where truth is far stranger than fiction (see also: Tickled, The Imposter, Catfish), this plainly told yet fascinatingly plotted film tells the story of an unlikely reunion. A set of identical triplets were separated at birth and adopted by three different families. Years later, through a set of unusual circumstances, they meet and once the excitement and confusion settles, they search for the real reason for their separation. There are some staggering twists along the way and while an argument could be made for its suitability for a smaller screen, it’s involving enough to cause plentiful discussion upon release.Giving the infinitely talented Lakeith Stanfield another starring vehicle (his second lead, after searing work in Crown Heights) and providing stoners with a new favorite movie, rapper Boots Riley’s directorial debut is worthy of all kinds of attention. It’s a feverish, funny, scary, angry, surreal satire about a black man finding out that his “white voice” can unlock a whole new world of opportunity. Despite a plot overflowing with disparate elements (the film lurches between slapstick and body horror), it remains confidently balanced announcing Riley as a fiercely original film-maker and cementing Stanfield as a bona fide star.While it might seem too soon for another Whitney Houston documentary after Nick Broomfield’s compelling if slightly lacking 2017 attempt, Touching the Void director Kevin Macdonald has secured an authorized take on the star’s rise and fall. He’s gained access to her family and friends, giving the film a more comprehensive feel, and uncovered some further tragic details from her life. It premiered at Cannes to mostly positive reviews, and while some are still seeking a doc that focuses more on Houston’s musical prowess rather than her troubling backstory, Whitney is set to be one of the summer’s most talked-about films.Arriving soon after Lady Bird, this middle school-set drama promises to deliver an equally awkward and idiosyncratic look at a period in life usually served with a heavy coating of gloss. It was one of the best-reviewed titles at this year’s Sundance festival, marking the directorial debut of comedian Bo Burnham and following the misadventures of a girl preparing herself for the transition to high school. A superlative-packed trailer might play up the film’s lighter moments but reviews suggest it’s not just a cringe-filled comedy. Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson called is “simultaneously harrowing and sweet” while the AV Club’s AA Dowd praised its combination of “crushing realism and humane affection”.US release: 13 July (UK release: TBC but screening at Sundance London on 2 June)One of 2014’s most underrated films, Appropriate Behavior served as an almighty showcase for writer, director and star Desiree Akhavan. It was a marvel of wit, sadness and insight, telling the story of a woman dealing with a difficult break-up. Her follow-up is an adaptation of Emily M Danforth’s 2012 novel about a young girl shipped off to a conversion center to “cure” her homosexuality. It was warmly received at Sundance, picking up the festival’s highest honor, the grand jury prize, and gifts Chloë Grace Moretz with arguably her first fully-formed adult performance.Despite a rather muted premiere at last year’s Toronto film festival, there’s been steady background noise accompanying literary drama The Wife. The cause of such buzz is a question that we won’t see answered until next year: can this film finally win Glenn Close her Oscar? The six-time nominee remains one of the Academy’s most cruelly overlooked talents and with many calling this one of her best performances, her luck could finally be changing. In the film she plays the wife of a celebrated author, played by an equally impressive Jonathan Pryce, who has spent the majority of her life living in his shadow but as cracks start to appear in their marriage, her position experiences a dramatic shift. It’s a dazzling showcase for Close and a compelling drama in its own right.It’s been a rocky few years for Spike Lee, with a number of his projects failing to land, from his doomed Oldboy remake to his uneven yet often startlingly effective Chi-raq to the dismally received vampire flick Da Sweet Blood of Jesus. But after he transformed his 1986 calling card She’s Gotta Have It into a well-received Netflix series last year, he’s returning to the big screen with a renewed sense of vigour at a time when America needs him most. In fact-based 70s drama BlacKkKlansman, John David Washington stars as a black detective going undercover, with the help of a white cop, played by Adam Driver, to infiltrate the local chapter of the Klan. It picked up the grand prix award at Cannes after a 10-minute standing ovation, with reviews suggesting it might be Lee’s biggest hit for years.Hoping to repeat the summer sleepover success of 2017’s The Big Sick, this romantic comedy, also produced by Judd Apatow, has a nifty conceit. Based on the Nick Hornby novel, it tells of a love triangle between Annie (Rose Byrne), her boyfriend Duncan (Chris O’Dowd) and Tucker (Ethan Hawke), the guy who happens to be both Annie’s new lover and Duncan’s favorite musician. Can the unofficial Bridesmaids reunion of Apatow, Byrne and O’Dowd lead to similarly crowd-pleasing mirth?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/321fb67c44181d39a421f4877a5b39915b754da1/755_28_2079_1247/master/2079.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7e5ae91e60237845024e77da47f4dad","title":"cafu picks his all time brazil xi","story":"The brilliant full-back picks his all-time side from an impossibly talented group of players who have represented Brazil down the years. Now you can do the same with our interactive toolWow, choosing the Brazil best XI of all time – that’s a tough one. There are so many brilliant players in each position, and that means some great players will miss out. My team is set up in a super offensive formation. We might concede a lot of goals, but we would score so many more. In fact, I can guarantee five goals every game!The best form of defence is to have the ball. A team with Falcão, Zico and Rivellino at its heart could play for years without making a mistake in possession. When you have the ball, you don’t have a problem. That is my philosophy in choosing my all-time Brazil XI.The goalkeeper in my special team is Cláudio Taffarel. He was so calm, smooth and peaceful, always giving us confidence on the field. He didn’t do anything fancy, never jumped or ed unnecessarily and always had the ball under control. He played three World Cups, always as Brazil’s No 1. That is not an easy achievement.My right-back is Carlos Alberto Torres. Whether defending or attacking, he was always good. Carlos was a great leader, but his technique was even more incredible. His famous goal against Italy in 1970 was such a beautiful, powerful strike.The two central defenders are Aldair and Lúcio. They never played together, but I believe that they would form an amazing partnership. Aldair was very calm, never made a bad tackle and his positioning was incredible. He was my team-mate at Roma and with the Seleção – he saved my life many times when I was attacking. Lúcio was more aggressive and intense. He scored many goals, and had a great passing range and all-round quality.Left-back, for sure, is Roberto Carlos. A world champion, he played at a high level for many years, with the same quality and intensity whether defending or attacking. He was a giant. I have never seen a shot as powerful as his. He had a missile in his leg!Midfield is the hardest area of the team to pick. There are many, many players who could play in the middle of a Brazil dream team, but I can only pick four. First, my defensive midfielder is Paulo Roberto Falcão, who starred in the 1982 World Cup. He was a smart player, a legend with an elegance rarely seen on a football pitch. The king of assists, he never misplaced a pass or made a mistake.In front of Falcão, I have chosen a ‘super trio’ of attacking midfielders. The first is Rivellino. His elastico move was beautiful, like something from another planet. I love him! He was the best dribbler of a football ever.My other two midfielders are Zico and Rivaldo. Zico was intelligent, had incredible vision and could strike a superb free-kick. A foul around the area was as good as a goal to him. As for Rivaldo, he was a genius. Come on! It was so wonderful to see him with the ball. He played with the same style as Falcão. Rivaldo was brilliant.Picking the two attackers is easy. The first is the best player of all time – Pelé. Do I need to say anything more? The athlete of the century, he scored more than 1,000 goals, and won the World Cup three times. He was complete. I don’t need to say anything more. Pelé is Pelé. No one can beat him.Pelé’s partner up front is Ronaldo. He was incredible too. You had to pay attention to both feet with Ronaldo as they were as good as each other. He was an example to other players, too. He suffered three serious injuries during his career, and was always fighting against these problems. Ronaldo was essential to us in 2002 when we became world champions. The coach for my all-time Brazil team is Mário Zagallo, the manager for the World Cup win in 1970. He would make this team play very well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8193b4d6b470f1c897cc5a98dc9962994acb0c/0_6_3080_1848/master/3080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5d6e0591b9eb7ee9b7375c6af66ac19","title":"essam el hadary egypt goalkeeper 45 world cup oldest player","story":"As a boy El-Hadary had to hide his interest in football from his parents. Now he is set to become the World Cup’s oldest playerThis article is part of the ’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. the is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.In the history of the World Cup, no player has appeared in the same team as his own son-in-law. And it won’t happen again this year, though it very nearly did. Last year Shadwa El-Hadary, daughter of Egypt’s goalkeeper and captain Essam, got engaged to the flying winger Mahmoud Abdel-Moneim, commonly known by the single name Kahraba (Electricity). Only 48 days later the relationship was over, after the young player was found to be already engaged to an actress, which must create a uniquely awkward dressing-room dynamic.This should not stop Essam El-Hadary from making history in Russia. Throughout his career he has had, more or less in the back of his mind, one “dream I want to make true”. This summer it is set to happen, more than 22 years after his international debut, when he is expected to make his first appearance at the World Cup and become the oldest player to play in the competition, at the age of 45.It has been a long journey, and not without drama, for the player nicknamed the High Dam after the popular Egyptian water-blocking barrier. He was born in January 1973 in a small town called Kafr al-Battikh – literally Town of the Watermelon – near Egypt’s Mediterranean coast. Despite its name the town is famed not for fruit but for the production of wooden furniture, and Essam’s father was a craftsman who owned a small workshop. He gave his young son an ultimatum: work hard at school or work hard making furniture. His child considered the two options, ignored him and played football instead.This he had to do in secret, taking his schoolbooks to the local playing fields so his parents would believe he was studying, and washing his dirty clothes in a nearby river so they would not discover how he was filling his days.It was on the local dirt pitches that the talented goalkeeper – comfortable on the ball, often playing outfield – was spotted by his local side in Kafr al-Battikh. At 17 he was snapped up by the Egyptian second ision team Damietta. He played in their academy for a season before he summoned the courage to tell his father about his new career. Every day he would run the 7km from his home to training alongside his best friend who would keep him company on a bike.The 6ft 2in goalkeeper has a towering demeanour and attributes his strength and fearlessness to his uncomfortable beginnings. Before arriving at Damietta he had never worn goalkeeping gloves, and on his first day was handed a pair. On his second day he turned up without them, declaring that he wanted to keep training with bare hands, the way he always had. Suffering through the resulting cuts and bruises helped him to prepare for the aches and pains inevitably suffered by a professional footballer.He made his debut for Damietta in 1993 aged 20 and after an impressive first season was a shock call-up to the national team, albeit as the fifth-choice goalkeeper. He still did not have a car, so a neighbour drove him to the national team’s training camp in his 1970s Peugeot estate.At the end of his second season, with one year of his contract remaining, El-Hadary secretly signed a pre-contract with al-Ahly. By this time a number of teams had shown interest and he had to pretend he was still looking for a team until the campaign was over and he was free to make his agreed move.Essam spent 12 years at al-Ahly and established himself as one of the country’s best players and a fixture in the national team. He is a dominating and loud presence in goal, using his voice, physique and reputation to instil fear into the opposition. The Chelsea and Ivory Coast legend Didier Drogba, thwarted at his hands on multiple occasions in the Africa Cup of Nations, once proclaimed El-Hadary his most troublesome opponent.El-Hadary is famed in Egypt for celebrating big victories with a watermelon, in honour of his hometown, and for clambering on to the crossbar after notable successes and dancing, while his supporters chant “Oros ya Hadary” (“dance el-Hadary”). One such occasion was at the 2002 CAF Super Cup, when al-Ahly beat Kaizer Chiefs 4-1 with el-Hadary scoring his side’s third goal, the first of his career, with a free-kick from his own half (there has been one more, a stoppage-time penalty for the Saudi side Al-Taawoun in a victory over al-Ettifaq last year).In 2008 he controversially left al-Ahly to join the Swiss side Sion. He did so without telling his employers and despite being under contract el-Ahly lodged a complaint with Fifa and he was banned for four months. He learned from this mistake: when Hull City tried to buy him after a trial in 2011 his then employers, the Sudanese club al-Merrikh, turned down their offer and he grudgingly returned to Africa.He made his international debut in 1996, 10 months before the youngest player in Egypt’s World Cup squad, Stoke’s 21-year-old winger Ramadan Sobhi, was born. There have been more than 150 appearances since, in which time he has won the Africa Cup of Nations four times, and been named that tournament’s best goalkeeper on three occasions.For Egypt he is the last remaining member of the golden generation that won a hat-trick of African Cup of Nations titles between 2006 and 2010. Even though he is coming to the end of his career, when he plays there is a sense of calm in the defence and he is regarded as a hero in Egypt for his ability to step up during important games. Russia this summer will be his greatest test of all, but also – whatever the outcome – his greatest triumph. “This is a message to all footballers and others around the world,” he says, “that you should believe in your dreams and fight to make them come true.”Ahmad Yousef writes for Kingfut.Follow him on Twitter here.Click here for our Egypt team guide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f4e1a770543021c4585bf700a2b92bb90e37378/0_1051_2333_1399/master/2333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a29ba69dd74b6d7d544b237513ecadf1","title":"fish recipes six of the best turbot salmon kedgeree","story":"Cook up a fish supper with these recipes for stuffed salmon, kedgeree and the very on-topic baked turbotFor the salad1 small red onion, peeled and very thinly sliced2 tbsp red wine vinegar500g small waxy potatoes300g green beans, trimmed8 thin rashers smoked streaky bacon (optional)6-8 smoked mackerel fillets, skin and pin-bones removed1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, leaves roughly choppedSalt and black pepper For the dressing2 tsp dijon mustard1 heaped tsp capers (optional)6 tbsp olive oilIn a small bowl, submerge the red onions in the vinegar and leave to marinate for 10 minutes.Cook the potatoes whole in boiling water for 15 minutes or until tender, then drain, peel and cut in half.

Young people describe how their lives changed dramatically overnightIn her bedroom in Clacton-on-Sea, on the Essex coast, 16-year-old Somer Lawrence perfects her Tim Burton-themed Halloween costume. By the time the night is done, Lawrence will have downed a 70cl bottle of vodka. The Corpse Bride is drunk.In the Cotswolds village of Wotton-under-Edge, 29-year-old Lee Peters manages to play the piano in his flat, despite having consumed an entire bottle of gin.In Malia, Crete, 18-year-old Stuart Marshall celebrates the end of his lads’ holiday by drinking five half-pints of spirits.Meanwhile, 23-year-old Rebecca Charles enjoys the sunshine with friends at the beach. They bring cider, beer and wine. By nightfall, she will have drunk 35 units of alcohol.What all these stories have in common is what happened next. Charles woke up at 5am and was sick straight away. Marshall’s friends found him curled up in a ball. Lawrence was rushed to hospital. Peters was carried out of his house on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance after a neighbour called 999.They had all developed pancreatitis, a disease brought on by excessive alcohol consumption that can turn one night in the pub, or a day at the beach, into a life-altering illness – it can often be fatal.“You can get pancreatitis after a single binge,” says Dr Sarah Jarvis of the campaign group Drinkaware, although she explains it’s more common to develop it after repeated binges.After the sudden death of the Swedish DJ Avicii, pancreatitis is becoming better known. He had been afflicted by the condition after abusing alcohol during exhausting world tours and, after his death, his family issued a statement saying “he could not go on any longer”. His death has forced us to pay attention to a condition we would perhaps rather ignore.In the UK in 2016, 7,327 people died of a range of conditions that could be directly attributed to alcohol abuse. While the number of direct alcohol-related deaths have been relatively constant since 2013, they are higher than they were in 2001, when 5,701 people died as a direct result of alcohol abuse. English alcohol-related hospital admissions are at a record high – up two-thirds from a decade ago – while spending on alcohol support services has been cut.Peters, Lawrence and Charles all now have chronic pancreatitis. “In the town I lived in, drinking was a massive part of the culture,” says Charles, who is now 31. “Everybody else was doing it. But I wasn’t getting up in the morning and drinking – the way people imagine alcoholics behave. I was just too much of a party girl.”“I was stupid and young,” says Lawrence, who is now 20. Although she went to hospital several times after the incident at her Halloween party, Lawrence continued drinking, and developed chronic pancreatitis at 17. She began drinking aged 14 because it eased her anxiety and depression. “I’d turn to alcohol as a coping mechanism,” she says. “I’d always be the one at the party who’d had the most to drink. It gave me liquid confidence.”She isn’t alone. “Wine had this lovely, numbing quality to it,” Peters says. Now aged 34, he began binge drinking after being violently assaulted at 16. “It was absolutely a response to trauma. It was the self-medication tool I used when things got stressful.”Alcohol abuse is often linked to mental ill health. “Drug and alcohol use can lead to mental health problems, and vice versa,” says Dr Cyrus Abbasian, a consultant psychiatrist at St George’s, University of London, who specialises in mental health and substance abuse. He explains that alcohol is an anxiolytic, meaning that it has a sedative effect. “You’re self-medicating your mental health condition,” he says. “Alcohol leads to short-term relief of anxiety, but it doesn’t treat the underlying problem.” Over time, a person may develop alcohol dependency, alongside their existing, untreated mental health issues.In a difficult relationship, and with postnatal depression after the birth of her daughter, Charles fell in with a party-loving crowd. “You think the alcohol is making things better,” she says. “But it’s actually making things worse.”Some argue that minimum-unit pricing, implemented in Scotland earlier this month, would tackle the problem of at-home drinkers who take advantage of cheap supermarket offers. “Minimum unit pricing is an excellent idea,” Abbasian says, “because it’s an evidence-based public health intervention. With any drug, you need to limit supply and increase price to reduce use. If something is cheaply and easily available, people tend to use it.” In some instances, supermarkets had been selling alcoholic drinks more cheaply than the same quantity of water.But would minimum-unit pricing have deterred Lawrence, who would drink a bottle of vodka because she was too young to get into bars? Possibly. “When you’re young, you can’t get into pubs, so you get a bottle of vodka for seven or eight pounds,” she says. “I don’t know why we thought it was necessary to be drinking spirits. Why were we drinking vodka at 15 or 16? It’s what everybody did, so it’s what I did.”We all have friends who push things too far. They’re the ones with cracked phone screens and jeroboam-sized hangovers on Sunday mornings. Their anecdotes of drunken misadventures make you laugh, but also make you queasy.Or maybe you’re that friend. “People drink so much because it’s our culture,” adds Lawrence. “The sun comes out and you go to a beer garden. It’s what we do. Everything is just an excuse to drink. Life is hard for everybody, so it’s nice to have an escape.”But Jarvis believes if people were aware of the health consequences of binge drinking, they would drink less. “Most people have no idea that you may be doing yourself damage now that can last a lifetime.”Here’s something to make binge-drinkers pause mid-sip: pancreatitis hurts. “It’s like the worst stomach ache you’ve ever had,” Marshall says.When your pancreas begins to fail, the pain never goes away. After her pancreatitis turned chronic, Charles’s pancreas stopped producing the enzymes she needed to digest food, causing her to become malnourished. Her weight dropped to 29kg (63lb). She can’t work full-time or look after her 10-year-old daughter. On good days, she showers and does laundry. The bad days are dark. “I think: ‘I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up.’”Life becomes small. Drinking buddies melt away faster than ice in a spritzer on a warm summer day. “It’s lonely,” Charles says, “when you’re surrounded by people who party the whole time and you don’t want to be a part of that any more. It’s like they don’t want to know you.”Peters also lives alone. A kindly neighbour checks up on him. “She has dug me out of some dark places,” he says. When he goes out, his emaciated frame attracts pitying looks. “It’s difficult because I used to be a good-looking chap with a decent body that people would comment on.” But not being able to work takes the biggest toll. “I feel quite ashamed by it,” Peters, a former accountant, says. “Having to go from being fiercely independent to being dependent on the state doesn’t sit well with me.”After we talk on the phone, Peters emails me a list of the 14 medicines he takes daily, and the 25 symptoms he experiences. (“Constant, debilitating pain … regular sepsis.”) “I can sense the grim reaper approaching,” Peters writes, before signing off with a cheerful reminder not to work too hard.How does he bear it? Keeping his mind occupied helps. So do antidepressants. Knowing that he caused his disease, Peters says, “is difficult to cope with”. After his first bout of pancreatitis, Peters kept drinking. “It’s difficult to explain why,” he says, pointing to the trauma of his early attack as a partial explanation. He also felt that doctors were possibly exaggerating the severity of his condition, out of overcautiousness.“It’s hard to explain what makes people unable to stop drinking,” says Abbasian. “With some patients, I have a conversation with them, and they say: ‘Yes, doctor, if I drink, I’ll have pancreatitis and I’ll die.’ But they don’t find other things as pleasurable and, because of their underlying anxiety disorder, they continue to self-medicate.”Peters says: “I have tried very hard to come up with a rational reason as to why I was so neglectful and blase about my health, but there’s nothing I can come up with that will make sense to anybody. I’ve been very foolish. I made those decisions and I’m aware I made them. I thought: ‘Hell, sod it, I’ll think about it tomorrow.’ But tomorrow catches up with you. It caught up with me, big time.”Chronic pancreatitis has no cure. Many people with the condition go on to develop pancreatic cancer. Surgical procedures are sometimes necessary. Charles’s gallbladder has been removed and doctors have performed a coeliac plexus block on her – an injection made using local anaesthetic to treat severe abdominal pain. Peters has advanced-stage chronic pancreatitis and takes prescription painkillers, including morphine, as well as enzyme replacement drugs, anti-sickness medication, anti-seizure medications, proton-pump inhibitors to reduce the acid in his stomach, anti-constipation tablets and meal-replacement drinks.Despite all these interventions, about one in five people with pancreatitis will die within five years of their diagnosis. “I have a terminal prognosis,” Peters says quietly. “I have gone downhill quite rapidly in the last six months. Lots of treatments don’t work any more. I’m literally wasting away.” A few days after we speak, Peters experiences projectile vomiting, a fever and excruciating pain and is admitted to hospital with an acute flare-up of pancreatitis.It’s easy to be judgmental about Peters’ situation. You may think: why didn’t he just stop drinking when his doctors warned him? But trauma makes people behave irrationally. Rape survivors become promiscuous, intelligent people ignore medical advice, the children of alcoholics binge-drink.And even if you have never experienced trauma yourself, not drinking in our culture is hard. “My friends are drunk all the time and they’ll be in the club buying me drinks,” Lawrence says. “They don’t realise the severity of my illness because they don’t have to live with it.” Charles gets angry when she sees people being peer-pressured. “People will taunt someone who isn’t drinking,” she says. “It’s like: you’re a weirdo if you don’t drink.”“Humans are social animals, but we don’t like to be around a lot of people we’re not familiar with,” Abbasian says. “Socialising, going out on a Saturday, is anxiety-provoking. When you go to a bar or club, you drink to reduce anxiety levels so you can drink and talk to strangers. Alcohol disinhibits you.”Forced sobriety at least helps you to see things anew, in a clear-eyed way. “I notice everything on nights out – I’m not blind to things any more,” Marshall says. “Even with some of my friends, I think: you turn into a wanker when you’re drunk.”Abbasian says: “If alcohol were a relatively new drug introduced into our society, and not as socially acceptable, it would be a class A drug, similar to heroin or cocaine.” He urges those who regularly binge drink to seek assistance, before it’s too late. “There’s a lot of stigma and denial. A major first step is to accept you have a problem and not be ashamed getting help and treatment.”All the people I spoke to wanted me to share their experiences. In fact, many of them reached out to me, desperate to warn others.“My message is: be careful,” Charles says. “Just because you’re young and you only go on weekend benders, and don’t drink every day, doesn’t mean you’re invincible. Because you’re not.”And the next time you drop a crate of sticky bottles off at a recycling bank, Peters would ask that you remember him and reconsider your drinking. “If just one person can read this and think that, it would be enough for me,” he says. “Just to make a difference to that person and their family. It would be my whole life’s work complete for me. I would be over the moon.”Drinkaware is an independent UK charity working to reduce alcohol misuse and harm.

Originally created by the great French chef Auguste Escoffier during his spell in charge of the kitchens at the Savoy in London, and named in honour of opera star Dame Nellie Melba, in residence at the hotel while performing at Covent Garden, its fame quickly spread beyond the confines of WC2 – helped along, no doubt, by the immense celebrity of both parties.Yet the dish stands on its own merits, too: this glorious combination of tangy peach and softer, sweeter raspberry brings out the best in both fruits, which are taken to even greater heights by the cool, creamy pleasures of vanilla ice-cream. As the great man himself wrote, “Pêche Melba is a simple dish,” but he went on to warn that “any variation … ruins the delicate balance of its taste.” Is the world’s first master chef right – or, 125 years after its creation, could this classic do with updating?At the height of summer, you might well get away with using raw peaches, so ripe they need nothing in the way of sugar, as Margaret Costa suggests in her Four Seasons Cookery Book, but given the rarity of this occurrence in the UK, it makes sense to have a contingency plan. In any case, lovely as fuzzy peach skins are, Escoffier would never have allowed them past the pass. He calls for the fruit to be blanched and then dunked into iced water, so the skins can be slipped off and the fruit simply sugared to draw out its juices, although Bruno Neveu, former pastry chef at the Ritz-Escoffier cooking school in Paris, poaches them, too, perhaps because raw peaches are judged to have a little too much in the way of texture to allow elegant consumption.Poaching the fruit in syrup is fairly standard in modern recipes, although the medium varies: Nigel Slater counsels moderation with the sugar: “Too often, they come out cloyingly sweet.” He also adds a squeeze of lemon juice and a twist of peel, as does Diana Henry, who suggests making the syrup with dry white wine rather than water. Barbara Cartland, whose pink-jacketed masterwork, The Romance of Food, the best present I’ve received in the past 12 months, shows no such restraint, and indeed, it pays off: the fruit isn’t in the syrup long enough to become sickly (five minutes to Henry’s 15-20), which means it remains pleasingly firm, too.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall tops his peaches with sugar and butter, and bakes them instead in his River Cottage Fruit Every Day: it does indeed make them “extra rich and toffeeish”, but also leaves them rather mushy – and none of us is quite sure how we feel about hot peaches (see also crumble), although he reckons the contrast in temperature is “a key factor in this gorgeous pud”.We all enjoy Escoffier’s blanched and sugared peaches: they still have the juicy, plump texture of the ripe fruit, as well as being far more economical with the sugar. If your peaches are really under-ripe, however, I’d recommend poaching them for about five minutes in a syrup made from 150g sugar and 300ml water, perhaps with some lemon zest, vanilla or even a bay leaf if you’re feeling daring.Slater claims that “peaches need to be poached with their skins on”, but both Cartland and Richard Olney disagree. They must have more patience than me, however (or, in Cartland’s case, a personal chef, Nigel Gordon), because a ripe peach is a pain indeed to peel. Much easier to blanch them as Escoffier and Neveu recommend.The variety of peach is more important than one might think: both Grigson and Henry prefer a white-fleshed fruit, but these tend to lack the acidity that plays off so nicely against the other ingredients: a standard yellow peach is both easier to come by and works better (save the white kind for bellinis). Nectarines, which I also try, seem to hang on to their skins more jealously than their furry cousins.If you can’t find any peaches – and Escoffier is clear that this must be made with “tender and very ripe peaches” – but have a yearning for a peach melba all the same, Olney allows that “home-canned peaches are respectable”, and I suspect he would also have given top-quality jarred fruit the grudging nod. The tinned kind tend to be watery and overcooked, but I can highly recommend the “hand-peeled Miraflores” fruit from Spanish brand El Navarrico, and no doubt other equally good versions are available.The special genius of this dish, for me, is the vivid red raspberry sauce that clings to the peeled peaches like a new and sweeter skin – again, you might get lucky and find fruit so stupidly ripe that it needs little more than crushing and sieving before use, but it’s more likely that you’ll need to sweeten it. Most recipes call for caster or icing sugar, which dissolves more easily in the pureed fruit, but Cartland uses currant jelly and kirsch, and Slater some of the poaching syrup, which feels like a clever way of putting it to use if you have it (if you go down the poaching road, leftover syrup is also very nice with some cold white wine or soda water). Currant jelly has a certain tang to it that helps to bring out the flavour of the berries, but Fearnley-Whittingstall’s lemon juice tastes fresher to us. (Again, Olney comes to the rescue of out-of-season cooks, advising the use of frozen raspberries that “still recall the flavour of the fresh”: make sure you defrost them first, though, or you’ll end up with a loose sorbet.)Unfortunately, you do need to sieve the sauce: this sounds like a faff, and you’ll lose a little of the flesh along the way – although they are edible, raspberry seeds are not terribly nice once isolated from their natural home, and also have an irritating tendency to lodge themselves in the teeth. Fearnley-Whittingstall’s recipe, which folds whole fruit into the sauce at the end, gives it the texture of the fresh berries and the heightened flavour of a puree.Cartland, the woman who spawned a thousand slender, willowy heroines, doesn’t even hint at the forbidden pleasures of ice-cream in her recipe, but Escoffier is explicit: the dish must start with a silver timbale full of vanilla ice-cream, and it’s hard to improve upon that idea, although we are rather taken with Henry’s alternative of lightly sweetened creme fraiche, especially if well chilled I suspect a scoop of proper frozen yoghurt (not the low-fat variety) would also be delicious. Try to use an ice-cream that isn’t too sweet: it shouldn’t overwhelm the fruit.Olney argues that peach melba “depends on three things only for it to rank among the finest of classical French desserts: the honesty of the ice-cream, flavourful peaches that have been freshly poached in a syrup containing only water and sugar, and a sauce that is nothing but a puree of fresh raspberries. The best whipped cream in the world only detracts. The only acceptable refinement is the sprinkling of a few sliced fresh almonds over the surface.” And while I may disagree on several points, he’s right about the almonds at least: they add a very gratifying crunch of which I’m sure Escoffier himself would have approved, if only he’d wasted less time chasing celebrities.4 ripe peaches4 tbsp sugar2 tbsp flaked almonds300g raspberries (thawed if frozen)1 tbsp icing sugar1 tsp lemon juice8 scoops good vanilla ice-creamBlanch the peaches in a pan of boiling water for a minute, then lift them out with a slotted spoon and dunk into iced water. Once they’re cool enough to handle, slip off their skins, cut in half and discard the stones.Put the peach halves in a shallow dish, sprinkle over the sugar, then set aside for about an hour, preferably in the fridge, turning once. Meanwhile, toast the almonds until lightly golden and leave to cool.Whizz two-thirds of the raspberries with the icing sugar and a tablespoon of lemon juice, then adjust to taste and push through a fine sieve to make a smooth sauce. Stir in the remaining 100g raspberries and put in the fridge until you’re ready to eat.To serve, put two peach halves in each dish and top with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. Pour the sauce over the top and finish with a sprinkling of flaked almonds.• Peach melba: a retro classic, or a fussy French waste of perfectly good fruit?

Each is also short-listed for a creative hub if it fails to secure the main prize of the new headquarters.The new national HQ, which will operate alongside Channel 4’s £100m London base in Victoria, will have facilities including a TV studio, and host executive and board meetings.Channel 4, which has said the shift of staff and resource out of London is the biggest structural change in its 35-year history, has also shortlisted six smaller cities that are only eligible to battle to be the home of the two new creative hubs up for grabs.These are Belfast, Brighton, Newcastle-Gateshead, Nottingham, Sheffield and Stoke-on-Trent.The broadcaster has said its second main base must be in a city with a working population of more than 200,000 people, travel time to London of less than three hours, and high-quality physical and digital infrastructure.West Midlands mayor Andy Street, the former John Lewis boss, said he was pleased his region had overcome the “first hurdle” in the bidding process. The West Midlands has been selected as a candidate for the national HQ or a creative hub.“This was the first hurdle we needed to overcome,” said Street. “Now the hard work really starts as we begin negotiations in earnest to develop the most compelling case possible to the broadcaster.”Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson pitched his city as a “soulmate” for Channel 4.“This is a hotly contested bidding competition and to reach this next stage in the process demonstrates Liverpool’s pulling power as a location that offers businesses and their employees a great worklife balance,” he said. Channel 4 said it received more than 30 submissions in the first round of its relocation process.“After careful consideration by the Channel 4 executive team, we’ve selected 13 cities that are best able to meet our vision for our new hubs in the nations and regions,” said Jonathan Allan, Channel 4’s chief commercial officer, who is running the pitch process. “We look forward to visiting all those on the shortlist as part of our second phase, but we will also be continuing to work with all cities and regions as part of our strategy to increase investment and support creative businesses, jobs and growth across the UK.”Channel 4 News will also open three new news bureaux, with a trebling of news jobs in the nations and regions by 2020, while spend on shows made by TV production companies based outside London will rise from £169m annually to about £350m a year by 2023."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23353f60c42a770b988fa2f2dbebb7a910f39f38/0_185_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=740c4ed71afd27f75a4dfc1c4cf4bcf0","title":"martin sorrell plots his comeback weeks after exit from wpp","story":"Former boss of world’s biggest advertising group reveals he is already in takeover talks Sir Martin Sorrell has revealed he is in takeover talks with a number of companies as he looks to rebuild an international marketing business, weeks after he was forced out of WPP following allegations of personal misconduct.Almost immediately after Sorrell was forced to stand down in April, having run the world’s biggest ad group for more than three decades, he began talks to stage his comeback.On Wednesday, he delivered on his promise that it would be a case of “back to the future” – as he had hinted in a resignation letter to WPP staff last month – detailing a reverse takeover of another small listed company to use as a vehicle to rebuild his empire.“S4 Capital is a company that aims to build a multi-national communication services business focused on growth,” said Sorrell. “There are significant opportunities for development in technology, data and content. I look forward to making this happen.”Derriston, which began talks with Sorrell in May, will change its name to S4 Capital. Sorrell incorporated S4 Capital, a reference to four generations of his family, in Jersey on 22 May, with £40m of his money and £11m from other investors.A number of those investors have also signed “non-binding letters of support” to provide in principle more than £150m of further funding to fuel Sorrell’s acquisition plans.Derriston disclosed in a financial filing that Sorrell is closing in on a number of potential acquisition targets.“The directors of the company understand that S4 Capital is at present in preliminary discussions regarding a select number of potential acquisitions that would fit with the strategy of building a multinational communication services business,” the company said. “S4 Capital intends to target businesses focused on technology, data and content.”Sorrell has also gone back to the future for his non-executive directors, calling in Rupert Faure Walker, who advised on the takeovers of J Walter Thompson and Ogilvy \u0026amp Mather in the late 1980s, which transformed WPP, a small maker of wire baskets, into a major global force in advertising.He has also appointed Paul Roy, the former British Horseracing Authority chairman, and the founder of the investment management company NewSmith Capital Partners.Alex DeGroote, a stockbroker at Cenkos, believes that Sorrell will not be able to resist targeting a major WPP asset.“It wouldn’t surprise me if he was discreetly sounding out JWT or Ogilvy, they were the anchor assets that built WPP,” he said. “Institutional investors would feel more comfortable backing the acquisition of assets known to them, like Ogilvy which has moved from the Mad Men era to digitally fit for purpose. I think Sorrell will make a headline grabbing, transformational deal within nine months.”Sorrell has structured the deal to give himself a five-year window to grow S4 Capital and make his exit, by which point he is likely to be close to his 79th birthday.Sorrell was able to bounce back so quickly because of the unusual nature of the contract he had at WPP. Instead of the standard notice period of 12 months, he or the company was able to terminate the contract “at will” with no non-compete clause.WPP classified Sorrell as having “retired”, after deciding not to make the outcome of its investigation into misconduct allegations public, meaning he will make almost £20m in payouts from his former employer over the next five years.The WPP chairman, Roberto Quarta, is facing an investor backlash at the company’s annual meeting next month over the Sorrell affair, with the influential advisory company Glass Lewis recommending shareholders vote against his reappointment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/005f17f40e080f04b984b4060ad9f0239e747f02/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f43f40efdba1329350cbb9026163924a","title":"we need to talk aboutveganism","story":"In this monthly podcast,  supporters share their experiences and put questions to a panel of journalists and industry experts.

These could include having its listings pulled from search engines such as Google.The Advertising Standards Authority is expected to outline a list of sanctions against Viagogo for persistently breaching the advertising code by failing to be clear about its fees, despite earlier promising to improve transparency.On Wednesday morning, during a BBC radio interview, James advised anyone planning to buy tickets on resale websites: “Don’t choose Viagogo – they are the worst.”She issued the advice in the wake of a series of high-profile controversies involving the website run by the US multimillionaire Eric Baker, the co-founder of the company’s biggest rival StubHub.The singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran recently cancelled 10,000 tickets for his tour because they had been bought through Viagogo.Sheeran’s promotion company Kilimanjaro Live, among those to file complaints about the company with the ASA, said Viagogo was the only resale firm not to comply with its request not to resell tickets for the artist’s shows.Earlier this month, the  revealed Viagogo’s involvement in the resale of football tickets in the UK, resulting in fans being overcharged and seated in the wrong end, undermining strict laws on segregation.The website has also been criticised for withholding refunds from overcharged fans, profiteering from charity events, refusing to attend a select committee hearing and breaching consumer rights laws.The Competition and Markets Authority, which is in the midst of an investigation into secondary ticketing, singled out the company with a warning that it could face legal action for failing to protect consumers.Founded by Baker in 2006 after he left StubHub, Viagogo has fast become one of the world’s largest ticketing companies, attracting legions of professional ticket touts using the website to resell tickets harvested in bulk, often at large mark-ups. has approached the company for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0d9d2bf7edb2942d60d194777ce5b32ccead8e5/0_44_1798_1078/master/1798.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0db58ba5270d4fb116e1c83238c16b12","title":"off the wall pin up posters from glam to new wave","story":"From David Bowie to X-Ray Spex, Richard Hell to Suzi Quatro, a new book collates some of the best posters of the 1970s and 80s to be tacked up in teenage bedrooms everywhere"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/112ee50ffcbe18da0dc5bfc1db5ec2c4880a7211/0_152_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38583d7fbee64cb1ccd66e67ec6b1b7a","title":"brexit uk may get poorer access than israel to eu science scheme","story":"Exclusive: UK may have to pay more for privilege of collaborating, draft paper saysTheresa May’s appeal for a special Brexit deal on science and research collaboration, worth billions to the British economy, is being stonewalled by Brussels as it prepares to offer an arrangement less privileged and more expensive than that given to non-EU states such as Israel.The European commission’s negotiators refused to discuss the issue in formal talks last week, instead insisting they would present the UK with conditions of entry for a “third country” into its €97.9bn research programme once they had been formally published. A draft copy of the so-called Horizon Europe document, seen by the , suggests that the UK is set to be offered less generous access than countries with associate status in the current programme, known as Horizon 2020, including Israel, Turkey, Albania and Ukraine.Those states, along with countries in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) – Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – will be “associated to all programme parts” of the new research and science framework, of which details are to be published on 7 June, according to the leaked document.It is understood that wealthy countries with a developed research and development capacity are to be offered a greater opportunity to pay in and collaborate with the EU under a reform of the current programme, which will end in 2020.However, the UK is set to join Canada and South Korea in the category of countries that will have to pay a higher price for the privilege of collaborating, while being barred from a particular raft of programmes designed to encourage innovation.According to the draft paper, so-called “third countries” will not have a seat on the new European Innovation Council, which sets priorities, and their companies will not have the opportunity to apply for “fast, flexible grants and co-investments” designed to “bridge the ‘valley of death’ between research, commercialisation and the scaling-up of companies”.Sources said it was additionally unclear what role the UK would have in shaping the priorities of Horizon Europe after Brexit, given it would no longer be a member state and would not be an EFTA member, acceding country, candidate country or potential candidate country.The European commission’s proposals will need to be approved by the member states. A senior EU official said they were aware that the UK would seek to change the rules from within during negotiations over the bloc’s future budget, known as the multi-annual financial framework (MFF).An EU official involved in the Brexit negotiations said of last week’s talks with the UK negotiators in Brussels: “We … had a discussion on science and technology where we said that from our point of view unfortunately this was slightly early as we are coming forward in early June with the proposals for the next generation of Horizon Europe, the successor to Horizon 2020, and these programmes will set out the conditions for third countries’ participation.“We would be happy to present that to the UK once that has been published. We take good note that the UK wants to maintain its role in shaping and priority setting of EU programmes in the future, and we also took very careful note of the announcement by the UK negotiators that they intend to use their part in the EU28 negotiations about the future MFF as an instrument to influence the definition of third country part rules in EU programmes.”Last week a British presentation to the EU negotiators, who were led by Michel Barnier, argued for full access to Horizon Europe and said “as an associate country we would look to agree an appropriate level of influence on the shape of the programme. This should be greater than current non-EU precedents, recognising the quality and breadth of the UK’s contribution.” Thomas Jørgensen, the senior policy coordinator at the European University Association (EUA) working on Brexit-related issues, said the commission was acting to protect its interests in the face of the emergence of the UK as a rival economic power.He said: “It is entirely understandable that you would want to help small countries in your neighbourhood, but why would you do that for small and medium-size enterprises in South Korea or other third countries such as the UK?“The view from Brussels is that leaving the EU is the UK’s choice, it is their choice to be South Korea. If they say they want a special deal, that’s not going to work.”Jørgensen said, however, that the scale of the UK’s research strength was such that it would inevitably have a large say in at least informal settings about the direction of the programmes.He said: “There is elasticity. But if it comes down to a matter of principles, then that could be a problem.”Diplomats attached to the member states suggested there were additional concerns about giving third countries access to sensitive research information. The UK is seeking an agreement to continue the flow of data between it and the rest of Europe, but a recent report on the country’s handling of personal information held on the Schengen Information System, designed to monitor the flow of people around Europe, has damaged that case.An official paper, dated 18 May 2018 and seen by the , reveals that despite a 2015 evaluation finding serious deficiencies with the UK’s handling of personal data, a follow-up visit in 2017 had discovered that a range of recommendations had not been implemented.The report notes that the EU’s inspectors had found that “very serious deficiencies in the legal, operational and technical implementation of SIS by the UK subsist”.Among the issues that caused concern was the discovery that UK officials had been copying personal data and sharing it with US contractors working for its immigration services and the border police. Some of that information was found to be out of date as well, raising the potential of people being unfairly flagged as they passed through the UK’s borders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/746e8c6f6bb45fc8890c24c99a5e9ae1bc208b02/262_39_3095_1858/master/3095.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d19201d68a388564dad7c6b8a17c3f58","title":"caroline lucas to step down as green party co leader","story":"Brighton MP says she has helped stabilise party and it is time for others to step forwardCaroline Lucas has announced she will stand down as co-leader of the Greens in the autumn, saying it is time for others in the party to step forward and widen the pool of its prominent figures.Lucas, for years the party’s sole nationally recognisable politician as well as its only MP, returned for a second stint as leader in 2016 on a joint ticket with Jonathan Bartley, who leads the opposition group on Lambeth council in south London.The party requires it leaders to re-stand every two years, and Lucas told the  that while she remained committed to her Brighton Pavilion constituency, she would not be continuing in the co-leader role.“I think making space for other people at this point is a straightforward thing to do and a good thing to do,” she said. “We have a wonderful array of talent in the party and I would love the opportunity for more of that to be showcased.” Nominations for the leadership and for a series of other senior party positions will be open during June, and there will be a vote in August. Bartley has previously said he does not wish to be sole leader, and it is possible he could seek a joint ticket with another candidate. Other contenders could include Siân Berry, a member of the London assembly, and Cleo Lake, a Bristol councillor newly made the city’s lord mayor.Lucas became the Greens’ first leader in 2008 after the party dropped its previous system of two “principal speakers”, and she increased her prominence further when she became an MP in 2010. She was replaced as leader by Natalie Bennett, who endured a difficult 2015 general election, after which Lucas and Bartley took over.Lucas said she and Bartley had stabilised the party since then and introduced “a far greater culture of professionalism” during a period in which the party’s vote share was squeezed as Labour moved to the left.“It’s no secret that we knew Jeremy Corbyn was going to take a lot of the space that we’ve been carving out for ourselves, so these were going to be challenging times and perhaps it was more important than ever to have at least one of our leaders in parliament,” she said. In an article for the  explaining her decision, Lucas argues she and Bartley are leaving the party in an improved position. “We focused relentlessly on electing Greens across the country. That’s meant more train journeys for me and Jonathan than I care to recall – which might explain why we’re both so passionate about public ownership of the railways,” she writes.“The effects are already clear – our best local election results ever earlier this month, bringing the Green party to every corner of this country, and seeing us break on to new councils as erse as Birmingham, Burnley and Richmond. The polls have now seen us overtake Ukip, and we’re closing in on the Lib Dems too.”When it was announced that she and Bartley would lead jointly, the idea was mocked by many. Lucas said another achievement had been to show this could work: “I think we’ve really demonstrated something very important with this model. I remember a lot of people saying this isn’t going to work. I think we’ve demonstrated that it is not only workable but positively desirable and effective.”She said this time she would not return. “I make it a point of principle never to rule anything out, but I cannot conceivably imagine at the moment any circumstance in which the party would be asking me to come back for a third time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bab73b40633d3f5b873e5d3eb61b55ee7e85e04c/0_168_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67df1292e51ba90c321bf40f0ef13258","title":"womens voices drop by two piano notes after pregnancy","story":"New mothers’ voices are lower and more monotone for about a year after the birthThe voices of new mothers temporarily drop by more than one piano note after pregnancy, scientists have claimed.Researchers from the University of Sussex found new mothers’ voices become lower and more monotonous after they have had their first baby.However, this “vocal masculinising” does not appear permanent, the team said – with voices reverting to previous frequency after one year.They speculate the change may be an attempt to sound more authoritative in response to the new role of parent, or could be driven by hormones. Lead researcher Dr Kasia Pisanski, of the University of Sussex’s School of Psychology, said: “Our results show that, despite some singers noticing that their voices get lower while pregnant, the big drop actually happens after they give birth.” The study examined 20 mothers, including singers, actresses, journalists and celebrities, and compared them to a control group. The women’s highest pitch also dropped by an average of 2.2 semitones, or more than two piano notes, and they had less variation in pitch, the study found. “Our results demonstrate that pregnancy has a transient and perceptually salient masculinising effect on women’s voices,” the authors said. Pisanski added: “One possible explanation is that this is caused by hormone changes after childbirth. “Previous research has shown that women’s voices can change with fertility, with pitch increasing around the time of ovulation each month, and decreasing following menopause. “We know that after pregnancy, there’s a sharp drop in the levels of key sex hormones, and that this could influence vocal fold dynamics and vocal control. “This effect could also be behavioural. Research has already shown that people with low-pitched voices are typically judged to be more competent, mature, and dominant, so it could be that women are modulating their own voices to sound more authoritative, faced with the new challenges of parenting.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d27b161f1d2cd21e00da38449786c0875a9f289/0_0_5526_3316/master/5526.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc4a61e92ddbf3ece9f0ef1bc0a1ae9d","title":"chris froome cycling bernard hinault giro ditalia","story":"• Team Sky hit back, calling for fairness over FroomeBernard Hinault has launched a stinging attack on Chris Froome, claiming the Team Sky rider should never have been on the Giro d’Italia start line owing to his anti‑doping battle.Froome joined Hinault and Eddy Merckx by becoming the third man in history to win three consecutive grand tour titles. The 32-year-old executed an extraordinary comeback to win the Giro d’Italia and add to his Tour de France and Vuelta a España victories from last year. Hinault claims Froome’s name should not be uttered alongside his own. “Froome does not belong on that list,” the 63-year-old Frenchman said, according to the Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws. “He should never have been allowed to start in the Giro. Why do we have to wait so long for a verdict? With what right does Froome get so much time to find an explanation? Is it because Sky has so much money?”“It’s a very complex case, with a lot of lawyers, a lot of documents, a lot of money. We will make our decision as soon as possible but we have no time. Everything is more complicated than usual in this case.”Froome and his legal team have been battling to rescue his reputation for several months since the  and the French newspaper Le Monde revealed he had returned an adverse test during the Vuelta a España in September.A urine test indicated he had double the permitted level of the asthma drug salbutamol in his system. It is understood Froome’s defence will centre on challenging the efficacy of the test. “This is all very sad,” Hinault said. “Froome is not part of the legend of the sport, because what image does he give cycling? He may also start the Tour later. It’s a real scandal. This has to stop.”A Team Sky Spokesperson said: ‘It is disappointing that Bernard is so outspoken given he has his facts wrong. Chris has not had a positive test, rather an adverse analytical finding for a prescribed asthma medication. As an ex-rider himself, Bernard will appreciate the need for fairness for each and every athlete.“And at the current time, Chris is entitled to race.

They certainly managed that at Lord’s. The crushing nature of that defeat has plunged them into an unexpected crisis that may necessitate a change of focus. If England lose the second Test against Pakistan at Headingley they will drop to No\u0026nbsp7 in the ICC Test Championship, their lowest position since the rankings were introduced in 2003. The retrospective rankings show the last time England were as low as No\u0026nbsp7 was, symbolically enough, December 1999. Myopia was a vice of English cricket in the 1990s but they may have to make a virtue of it in the next few months by going back to home specialists such as Chris Woakes and Moeen Ali. A disastrous summer would have such an effect on morale as to undermine any attempt to develop the side over time. There is plenty to love about Dom Bess, not least those infectious, eccentric interviews, but in the short term Moeen offers more in every currency. If England restore order this summer, the relatively easy winter tours to Sri Lanka and West Indies would enable them to open one eye to the future. They could also do away with the antiquated notion of a best XI. Rotation is the future, so why not make it the present? It would allow them to subtly flit between Woakes and Wood, Moeen and Bess, today and tomorrow. And by destigmatising the idea of a player being dropped, they would have scope to occasionally omit the core players who have become a bit too\u0026nbspcomfortable.It is surely no coincidence that all five of Jonny Bairstow’s Test hundreds have come in the first innings of the match – in other words, before he has kept wicket. England’s acceptance of Bairstow’s wish to stay as a keeper-batsman is weakening the team, especially now that Jos Buttler is back in the side. Bairstow is one of the few players with the capacity to score Test 150s, and you suspect he has not fully twigged how good he could be as a specialist batsman. He has such pride in his improved wicketkeeping that you can understand why he is so aggressively reluctant to give it up, and the potential effect on his morale means it is not a straightforward matter. Nor would it be an easy conversation, but England need to have it sooner rather than later: Bairstow’s pride has become a symbol of a dressing\u0026nbsproom in which too many players seem to get their own way.The Lord’s Test played out exactly as expected – except England and Pakistan swapped roles. Pakistan played with patience and discipline England were the loose cannons, as they have been for the past few years. At this rate Pakistan may have to give up ownership of the word mercurial. For the rest of the summer England should probably play a bit more like England, especially with the bat. They are like the dog that keeps soiling the same rug, and have become symbols of a culture of instant gratification. They should be smarter in their shot selection, and maybe take a lesson from their own past. In the year 2037, a young cricket geek will look at the scorecard from the Oval Test of 2017 and see a typical Ben Stokes innings: 112 from 153 balls, with nine fours and nine sixes. In fact it was a masterpiece of what we are now contractually obliged to describe as game management: he made 22 from 51 balls in extremely tough conditions, then 57 from the next 84 as things got easier. Finally, when he was left with the tail, he exploded to hit 33 from the last 18 deliveries. In one knock Stokes played a Test match innings, a one-day innings and a Twenty20 innings. All of the England batsmen should have it on their laptops."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cdc7ee8ea17447f2df8d72f21d48306bcef5d6a/0_234_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e2e6674fde04d9d8a0cbd822230e1ce","title":"french open 2018 day four halep djokovic zverev and norrie live","story":"Chardy versus Berdych is set to go to a decider after the latter made it two sets all.

The 17th seed has the break. Jaume Munar is determined to enjoy himself out there, holding to lead 3-2 in the second set on Suzanne-Lenglen. Novak Djokovic needs to refocus quickly.Every time you think Jaume Munar’s down, he punches back. He breaks straight back to make it 2-2 and give Djokovic, who’s not at his best, something to think about in this second set.Djokovic breaks to love to lead 7-6, 2-1. This one might turn into an exhibition. Mind you, losing tie-breaks isn’t always fatal. Look at Tomas Berdych. He lost two last night but he’s just won the third set against Jeremy Chardy, who leads 7-6, 7-6, 1-6 on Philippe-Chatrier.It’s a ruthless tie-break from Djokovic, who only allows Jaume Munar one point. The Spaniard prods a backhand return long and he’ll do well to maintain his high level from here.Jaume Munar holds. Can he shock Djokovic?A couple of holds and Jaume Munar will serve to force a tie-break. Djokovic will be eyeing a break. On Court 3, meanwhile, 13th seed Roberto Bautista Agut has taken the first set 6-4 against Santiago Giraldo.Marco Trungelliti can start filling the car up. The Argentinian has been sent on his way by Marco Cechinnati, who’s beaten the lucky loser 6-1, 7-6, 6-1. What must Bernard Tomic be thinking?Serving for the first set, Novak Djokovic finds himself facing three break points. He saves the first two but he pushes a shot out of bounds on the third. Jaume Munar breaks back! Djokovic leads 5-4. He won’t be happy.The second match on Philippe-Chatrier is one that was held over from last night. Jeremy Chardy led by two sets after winning two tie-breaks – but Tomas Berdych, the 17th seed, seems to have slept well. He’s broken for a 3-1 lead in the third set.Novak Djokovic is busy putting Jaume Munar in his place. The 2016 champion was broken in his first game and has responded by racing into a 4-2 lead.It’s very tight over on Court 7, but Pablo Carreno Busta keeps coming up with the goods at the crucial moments. The Spaniard, seeded 10th, leads 7-6, 7-6 against Federico Delbonis. The Argentinians aren’t having much fun with tie-breaks today. Leo Mayer has just lost one against France’s Julian Benneteau, who’s levelled their match at one set apiece on Court 1.A few more women’s matches have been wrapped up: Naomi Osaka has edged out Zarina Diyas 6-4, 7-5, Mihaela Buzarnescu has seen off Rebecca Peterson for the loss of three games and Anett Kontaveit has beaten Alexandra Dulgheru 7-5, 6-2. There goes the break. Djokovic is level. Crisis over!Then again, Jaume Munar has other ideas. He’s broken Djokovic in the very first game!On Suzanne-Lenglen, Novak Djokovic’s match against Jaume Munar is underway. The Serbian won’t be expecting too much trouble from the lowly Spaniard.Marco Trungelliti’s adventure looks like it’s coming to an end. He trails by two sets and a break against Marco Cecchinato on Court 9. It could be time to start putting the bags back in the car.Simona Halep doesn’t look too pleased but she’ll be delighted with the way she bounced back after that dire first set. The world No1 is through to the second round after blitzing Alison Riske 2-6, 6-1, 6-1.Elina Svitolina will be pleased with her progress. The fourth seed has dispatched Viktoria Kuzmova, dismissing the Slovakian 6-3, 6-4. All very professional from the Ukrainian, who is a major contender here. As for Simona Halep, she’s 4-1 up in the final set on Philippe-Chatrier.Barbora Strycova has beaten Ekaterina Makarova 6-4, 6-2. Some people are in a hurry this morning. The grey skies might have something to do with that.This is punishing from Halep, who is exacting full revenge for that first set. Vicious groundstrokes see her march ahead in the third set. She leads Alison Riske 2-6, 6-1, 2-0 and surely won’t be stopped now.While Halep grabbles with Riske, Elina Svitolina is merrily skipping along. She’s up a set and a break against Viktoria Kuzmova. Elsewhere Anett Kontaveit, the 25th seed, took the first set 7-5 against Alexandra Dulgheru.Alison Riske avoided the bagel but she hasn’t been able to stem the bleeding. Simona Halep stomps off with the second set, winning it 6-1, and a match that has been going for just over an hour is heading into a decider.Petra Kvitova didn’t want to hang around for long. The eighth seed has breezed into the second round, thumping Lara Arruabarrena 6-0, 6-4.Ouch. Alison Riske double-faults and she’s broken for a third time by Simona Haleo, who will serve for the second set at 5-0.Pablo Carreno Busta, the 10th seed and a nifty mover on clay, has snatched the first set against Federico Delbonis on Court 7. The Spaniard won an epic tie-break 9-7.Simona Halep is on fire now. Not literally. Only in tennis terms. She’s stormed into a 4-0 lead in the second set. What a strange match. This is more like it from the world No1.Naomi Osaka is cruising she’s taken the first set 6-4 against Zarina Diyas on Court 18. Barbora Strycova is also feeling good after bagging the first set against Ekaterina Makarova on Court 3. Simona Halep, meanwhile, is channelling her anger in the right way, breaking to love in the first game of the second set. Is this the start of the comeback?Simona Halep looks stunned. Alison Riske is overpowering her and the Romanian has no answers. Riske pummels another winner away and that’s enough for her to take the first set 6-2 in 39 minutes. The world no1 is in trouble.Elina Svitolina, the fourth seed, is up and running on Suzanne-Lenglen. The first set is hers. She’s taken it 6-3. Viktoria Kuzmova is being outplayed.In the battle of the Marcos on Court 9, it’s Cecchinato with the advantage. The Italian’s won the first set 6-1 against Marco Trungelliti.Simona Halep is all over the place at the moment. Alison Riske, who’s showing no fear, breaks again to lead 4-0 against the world No1. On Court 8 Mihaela Buzarnescu, the 31st seed, has taken the first set 6-1 against Sweden’s Rebecca Peterson.No problems for Petra Kvitova, who takes the first set 6-0 in 23 minutes. Lara Arruabarrena doesn’t know what’s hit her.Simona Halep is struggling early on and, sure enough, she drops her first service game. Alison Riske, the outsider, lands the first blow. Meanwhile Naomi Osaka, the exciting young talent from Japan, is looking dominant against Kazakhstan’s Zarina Diyas.Alison Riske is striking the ball cleanly on Philippe-Chatrier and the American holds in her first game despite being taken to deuce by Simona Halep. Elsewhere Petra Kvitova is looking ominous. The Czech has broken twice to lead 3-0 against Lara Arruabarrena.There’s likely to be a lot of interest on Court 9. Yes, it’s a match between the world No190 and the world No72. But it’s a match featuring road-tripping lucky loser Marco Trungelliti, who is a favourite with grandmas around the world at the moment. The Argentinian, who travelled from Barcelona to Paris with his family in tow after Nick Kyrgios’s late withdrawal handed him a reprieve, became a social media sensation after his wife documented their journey and his new-found celebrity rocketed even higher after he beat Bernard Tomic. He’s in action against Italy’s Marco Cecchinato now. But it’s the Italian who’s on top early on, breaking to lead 2-0.Play is underway. On Court1, former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova is in action against Spain’s Lara Arruabarrena, whose surname contains too many vowels for your humble live blogger.Another cloudy day in Paris and there are plenty of empty seats on Philippe-Chatrier. But the players are out, they’re knocking up and it’s almost time for tennis! Highest on our agenda at the moment is Simona Halep versus Alison Riske.Hello. Day four of the French Open and the world No1, Simona Halep, is finally going to get on court. A combination of the scheduling and the weather has meant that she’s had to wait but the Romanian’s turn has arrived at last. She’s first on Philippe-Chatrier, where she faces the USA’s Alison Riske, and where she was beaten in last year’s final by Jelena Ostapenko. Halep’s still waiting for her first grand slam title, having blown her latest chance when she lost the Australian Open final to Caroline Wozniacki, and will be determined to banish a few demons this morning.Halep will be eyeing another strong effort at her favourite tournament, although the tag of favourite might not apply to her. Instead, we turn to Elina Svitolina, the fourth seed, who was triumphant in Rome and excellent in her first-round match against Alja Tomljanovic. Svitolina is first up on Suzanne-Lenglen. Slovakia’s Viktoria Kuzmova will be keeping her company. Elsewhere Wozniacki faces Georgina Garcia Perez, a Spanish qualifier, and that’s followed by Britain’s Cameron Norrie taking on France’s Lucas Pouille, the 15th seed.Norrie and Pouille are fourth on Philippe-Chatrier but there’s plenty of intrigue elsewhere in the men’s draw, with Novak Djokovic facing Jaume Munar, the world No155, Dominic Thiem meeting the exciting young Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex Zverev taking on Dusan Lajovic.All that and we haven’t even got round to talking about Petra Kvitova, Kei Nishikori, Grigor Dimitrov, Sloane Stephens or Madison Keys. Let’s just hope the rain stays away.Play begins at: 10am BST, 11am in Paris."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b70af4228da49e257e27a5d00c1d5ce1cca3211/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bdb47b24910e4e80819f3a53cbd1859","title":"piers morgan richard madeley good morning britain host","story":"As an abruptly terminated interview with Gavin Williamson shows, Morgan’s Good Morning Britain summer stand-in is even more lacking in self-awareness than his predecessorOur country has been cleaved in two. Unable to reconcile their differences over this insurmountable matter, friendships have come to an abrupt halt and families have been permanently torn asunder. The nation is in disarray. Common ground is nowhere to be seen. And all because people can’t work out whether Piers Morgan or Richard Madeley is the more spectacularly weird Good Morning Britain host.Sure, on the surface, Piers Morgan runs away with it. Ever since he debuted in 2015, Morgan has essentially treated the programme the same way your deaf grandfather treats an Amazon Echo, bellowing an impenetrable barrage of opinion and abuse at the top of his voice regardless of anything else that happens to be going on. Piers Morgan’s gone-to-seed Joffrey shtick is now so pronounced that his colleagues openly make hay with it, tweeting pictures of their own distant faraway stares whenever he so much as opens his mouth. For a while, he looked unbeatable.But now a contender has arrived, and he is glorious. Since first being brought aboard as Morgan’s holiday cover in the middle of last year, Richard Madeley has quietly carved out a niche of his own. Madeley isn’t as combative as Morgan, but what he lacks in aggression he also lacks in self-awareness. A one-man Accidental Partridge generator, Madeley is fast developing into Good Morning Britain’s real star. In his first week, he overcooked a link about quicksand and veered off into confusing tangents about Gaby Roslin. In March, he commented lustily on a weather presenter’s dress immediately before crashing into a segment about the #MeToo movement.And on Tuesday – and this might be what ultimately clinches his victory – Madeley prematurely ended an interview with Gavin Williamson live on air. Peeved that the defence secretary wouldn’t answer a question on some recent language about Russia, Madeley began to scrawl furiously on his script. “You’re not gonna answer, are you? OK, alright, OK, interview terminated then”, he barked like a stroppy teenager, while an African elephant aimlessly stumbled around behind Williamson’s back.It was all there. Drama, showmanship and, most of all, the sense that this was just the tip of the iceberg. Over the years, Madeley has essentially become a concentrated version of himself. You sense that all the golden moments of old – the Ali G impersonation, the time he shook his fist at his daughter’s mugger on live TV – have been inexorably leading to a moment like this. Whenever he appears on camera, Madeley gets to ride roughshod over Good Morning Britain. It’s a place where he’s allowed to indulge all of his whims and digressions, no matter how batty or grumpy they happen to be. If Madeley is suddenly gripped by an idea – and he often is – Good Morning Britain is now the place where it can rise up and consume him. Make no mistake, Morgan created this environment. Thanks to him, Good Morning Britain’s dynamic is now one where the male hosts get to bulldoze whatever boorish path they like and the – much more traditionally competent – female hosts good-naturedly roll their eyes at the damage. When Morgan goes away, Madeley fills this vacuum perfectly.The problem is that Madeley is better at this than Morgan. The latter is hamstrung by his need to constantly be seen as a capital-J journalist a man forged in the fires of tabloid publishing, doggedly seeking out the truth no matter how unappealing it makes him look. But Madeley’s training ground was daytime television, so he’s softer and more camera-ready. Where Morgan looks angry, Madeley just looks clueless, and cluelessness is much more palatable first thing in the morning.This might be premature, but it feels as if the competition is over. The Piers Morgan experiment was a noble one, but Richard Madeley is the T-1000 to his T-800. He’s slicker and harder to resist. Instead of punching you to death, Richard Madeley will creep into your room and shove a spike through your face. At this point, Good Morning Britain is his for the taking. Unless Good Morning Britain does something radical and hires someone more suited to the job. Someone like, I don’t know, a tomato on a stick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/517f7d562ee7c853e7334c443db983896671b5a2/0_163_3189_1913/master/3189.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaea806b95ead0453dbbd90ada6a94bb","title":"rwandas 30m arsenal sponsorship divides opinion","story":"The deal with the football club will pay for itself in increased tourism, insist officialsAnyone confused as to why Rwanda chose to spend £30m putting its name on the sleeve of Arsenal’s football shirts could begin to answer their question by looking at President Paul Kagame’s Twitter feed.In common with many of his countrymen, Kagame is an avid fan of his “beloved club” and the president – who has been Rwanda’s head of state for almost as long as Arsène Wenger led Arsenal – has regularly offered his view on club matters over the past six years. To critics, the deal is an example of an autocrat who runs one of the poorest countries in the world indulging a private passion while subsidising one of the richest clubs in world football. But to Kagame’s supporters and some in the marketing industry, it’s a canny move that is already getting people thinking about the impoverished country’s tourism industry, which offers lakeside resorts and walks with mountain gorillas – with one expert estimating that the £30m investment could help to bring in £300m of new revenue.“Rwanda wouldn’t have occurred to me as a place for tourism, so perhaps you do need to shock people,” said Kelvyn Gardner, the head of international development at the Licensing Industry Merchandisers’ Association. “What you’re buying with sponsorship it’s brand recognition. Football shirts can be overmonopolised by things like online gaming companies, so it will stand out.”In that time he has attempted to transform the mountainous central African country into a prosperous nation. The capital, Kigali, is largely safe and clean, with a construction boom that includes five star hotels. Despite this there are few dissenting voices in the media, limited political opposition and it remains one of the poorest countries in the world.Much of the development work locally has been assisted by aid from western nations, with British and Dutch politicians this weekend complaining that they are sending money to a country that is now supporting a high-profile football team. Clare Akamanzi, the Harvard-educated chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, defended the agreement, saying the money for sponsorship came from a different pot from international aid. “Anyone who criticises our deal with Arsenal on account of Rwanda being poor or an aid recipient, either wishes for Rwanda to be perpetually so, or doesn’t understand that in any business marketing costs are a key component of a company’s expenditures,” she said, insisting the country is determined to double its revenue from tourism to $800m over the next six years.That said, the deal could be as beneficial within Rwanda itself as abroad. Premier League football is ever-present in the country, with countless radio phone-ins dedicated to the Premier League. Fans crowd into bars and betting shops to watch matches while local minibuses are covered in the colours of English teams – with the north London club among the favourites.“Many Rwandans, especially in urban areas, are fans of Arsenal,” explained Rwandan accountant Charles Sac, who is a supporter of Unai Emery’s side. “I think it’s entertainment and associated success involvement of black players in earlier years was a factor.”Sac said the reaction to the sponsorship deal had been positive in his country: “Rwandans were pleasantly surprised by the news and still excited.”As part of the deal Arsenal players will visit Rwanda to hold training camps, while the country’s logo will appear at the side of the pitch at the Emirates stadium and on the backdrops for post-match interviews.“This decision demonstrates Rwanda’s continuing reorientation from a francophone to an anglophone country,” said Timothy Longman, a professor at Boston University and author of Memory and Justice in Post-Genocide Rwanda.“The group that dominates Rwandan politics, society, and economics today grew up mostly in refugee camps in Uganda, They brought back to Rwanda with them a connection to many things associated with Britain, including Premier League football.”He speculated that while the decision “may be popular with the English-speaking elite in Kigali” many Rwandans could think of a better use for the money. Regardless, at least one person will be happy. Earlier this month Kagame delivered his verdict on Arsenal’s recent performance after they were knocked out of the Europa League by Atlético Madrid.He said the defeat “should not have been the kind of ending of an era” but insisted their recent lack of trophies was “long coming”.“Blame the owners,” Kagame concluded, shortly before his country signed the sponsorship deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/583528d9c60699838a9c4f0ab42291dd94b4718c/973_523_1828_1097/master/1828.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa0042851c040d65cbb3bdb9f3d9f8c2","title":"head of italys m5s rekindles negotiations to form a government","story":"A bitter row over the country’s future in the eurozone had ided populist partiesThe head of Italy’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement has rekindled negotiations to form a government, days after a bitter row over the country’s future in the eurozone ended a fledgling deal for populist parties to take power.Luigi Di Maio, the 31-year-old head of M5S, Italy’s largest party, indicated on Wednesday he was prepared to compromise on his controversial choice of a eurosceptic economist, Paolo Savona, for finance minister. But he insisted that his pick for prime minister remained political newcomer Giuseppe Conte. In the absence of an agreement between Di Maio , the president of Italy, Sergio Mattarella, and the far right leader Matteo Salvini, Di Maio said he favoured snap elections.“There are two paths ahead. Either we launch the Conte government with a reasonable solution or we vote right away,” he said.Italian markets, which have been hit hard by the political crisis, rallied on the news of a potential new deal, which would at least temporarily put plans for a new election on hold. While markets have also been worried about the prospect of a populist government taking over the eurozone’s third-largest economy, the new government that would be formed between an alliance of the M5S and the far-right League would have a relatively narrow majority in the Italian Senate, limiting their ability to take any dramatic action.But the promise of a new government was hit by complications almost as soon as it was floated. Salvini, the bombastic and xenophobic head of the League, who has proposed plans to detain and deport hundreds of thousand of migrants as part of his election campaign, indicated he still favoured snap elections.The latest development was another twist in a complicated tangle of news as the parties have tried and failed, several times, to reach a power-sharing deal.The M5S and the League are Italy’s biggest populist parties, but differ significantly on policy. An agreement reached earlier this month for a shared agenda was focused on plans to increase spending, slash taxes, and take a far tougher approach on migration than the previous centre-left government, including the creation of new detention centres across Italy.Di Maio and Salvini reached a deal to nominate Conte to serve as prime minister last week, even though the law professor has no political experience. Mattarella agreed on the choice, despite questions over whether he had padded out his CV. But the president on Sunday night vetoed the populists’ choice of Savona as finance minister, saying the nomination would send a message to markets and investors that Italy was prepared to default on its obligations to Brussels and might even contemplate an exit from the eurozone. Leaving the euro, Mattarella said, posed a risk to all Italians and their financial security.It was a controversial move, with both Di Maio and Salvini arguing that Mattarella had overstepped his constitutional authority and made a political decision, even though he is meant to be apolitical. However presidents have the constitutional authority to block such nominations, and have done so in the past.On Monday, Mattarella nominated a former official at the International Monetary Fund, Carlo Cottarelli, to serve as interim prime minister. Italian markets were in free fall on Monday and Tuesday, amid heightened fears that new elections were imminent, and that anti-euro parties were poised to make gains in the next poll. The market reaction is one factor that likely forced Di Maio back to the negotiating table."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff84c48828989deba9b73d38b8209eaa292b5100/0_227_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc773ca56f07929c68725954efe29df","title":"karachi residents cool off pakistan heatwave in pictures","story":"Pakistan’s most populous city is in the grips of a heatwave as temperatures soar to 45C.

This year, sanction was received for 220 temporary clerical officers to assist permanent staff in processing applications.“The increase in the volume of applications is undoubtedly in part influenced by Brexit-related demand, with around 10 per cent of all applications this year from applicants living in Great Britain,” the department said in response to queries.“However, there are also other drivers of demand, including a trend towards early renewal of passports, a growth in outbound travel, and a growing population.”As of the end of April, more than 276,000 passports had been issued since the turn of the year. In the same period, 39,000 passport applications were received from applicants residing in Northern Ireland, and more than 41,000 were received from applicants residing in Britain.The department said that in addition to taking on temporary staff, the Passport Office was working to improve services, including plans to expand the online renewal project, as part of its response to increasing application volumes. It said iniduals seeking to renew their passport should do so online, as waiting times for this service had been reduced significantly in recent years.“Adults renewing their passports are strongly encouraged to renew their passport online,” it said. “The online passport application service is fast, convenient and secure, and is processing applications in 10 working days, plus postage time.“In fact, in 50 per cent of cases, the processing time is currently down to five working days. “Applicants can apply from anywhere in the world, with no need for a paper form, witness or printed photos. Renewal applications received through Passport Express are currently processed in 16 working days.”It also said that applications from first-time applicants, as well as from those with loststolen passports, take longer to process.“For these categories of applications, robust identity verification and entitlement checks, as well as vital fraud and security procedures, are necessary to ensure that the integrity and security of the Irish passport is maintained,” it said. “These checks take additional time to complete.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"clare daly gives impassioned testimony on referendum result in the d%C3%A1il","story":"  May 29, 2018TD applauded by colleagues after impassioned speech during first D\u0026aacuteil sitting since referendum "},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you.

The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts.

Italian fizz have boomed in recent years as it successfully overtook champagne as a toast at weddings, birthdays and other special occasions.But now, for the first time, prosecco\u0027s seemingly unstoppable climb is slowing, according to accountancy group UHY Hacker Young.Last year saw the smallest sales rise since 2011, amid a rising cost of imports from Italy and France because of sterling\u0027s weakness, it found.Some 35.8 million gallons of sparkling wine were sold during the past year, an increase of 5 per cent on the previous 12 months.UHY Hacker Young suggested that prosecco may be suffering from brand overexposure through overstocking at supermarkets.Prosecco has lost its luxurious edge due to over marketing in supermarkets, experts saySpokesman James Simmonds said: A five per cent increase in sales is not at all bad but that comes after several years of double-digit growth.Unless the industry can revitalise its image this year, we may now be reaching \u0027peak prosecco\u0027. It is hard for a luxury product to make the leap into the mass market without losing its reputation for exclusivity.A lot of English wine producers are now vying to capture the space left, as prosecco moves to the mainstream.Meanwhile the English wine market is booming and gearing up to give prosecco and champagne a run for their money in the global market.Partly fueled by business experts looking for a change of scenery, a record 64 new wine producers and vineyards launched their businesses last year, a 73pc increase compared to 2015.Crémant vs crémant - the new fizz warsWine producers in England are expected to plant more than 1 million vines over the next 12 months, which will result in some 2 million more bottles of English wine being made each year, according to data from industry body English Wine Producers.Also gaining popularity are French crémant sparkling wines, which have muscled in on the party circuit and are challenging the domination of the old favourite fizzes.In the first two months of the year Waitrose saw its crémant sales increase by 28 per cent on last year, peaking on Valentines Day as shoppers opted for it as an alternative to other bubbly.Dartford bus crash sees 14 injured after ploughing into dozens of vehicles Royal wedding row over grass cutting as councillors accused of prioritising Meghan\u0026#39s hotelFrench police clear out Paris migrant campThe world\u0026#39s longest flight is launching in October (but there\u0026#39s a major catch)Ryanair quietly increases charge to travel with your carry-on bagEDL founder Tommy Robinson jailed for contempt of court after broadcasting tirade on FacebookStrictly Come Dancing 2018: new professionals dancers revealedBritish Putin critic Bill Browder released after arrest in Spain because Russian Interpol warrant had expiredRussia denies involvement in murder of journalist and Kremlin critic Arkady BabchenkoMinister urges consumers to boycott ticketing website Viagogo Anti-Putin Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko shot dead in Ukraine capital Magician David Copperfield not liable for Briton\u0026#39s injuries during trick as jury finds tourist was 100pc responsibleLobster, champagne and chips: how shopping habits really compare between rich and poorActive Shooter school massacre video game branded ‘disgusting’ and ‘horrific’ by Parkland victim parentsRoseanne blames offensive Twitter outburst on sleep medication as she returns to social mediaAnimal rights activists hail possible end to South Korean dog farms, as Olympic skier mourns death of adopted pet BeemoLong-awaited return of flights to the Lake District delayed due to staff shortagesIsraeli airstrikes hit dozens of Gaza targets after Palestinian mortar barrageWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/28/TELEMMGLPICT000164866705_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"regular meetings ruin productivity workers worry running late","story":"Staff anticipating a meeting mentally subtract the time they have availableRegular meetings ruin productivity because workers are constantly worried about running late, a study has found.Staff anticipating a meeting - or people expecting a friend for dinner - mentally subtract up to 30 per cent of the time they have available.Scientists found that having created an unnecessary buffer “in case something comes up”, people perform fewer tasks, or smaller tasks, than if their next appointment was not looming over them.Researchers at Ohio state University’s Fisher College of Business asked participants how long they could spend reading an hour before an appointment for which they were fully prepared.  Respondents said they had 50 minutes available, and even said that subjectively it felt like they had only 40 minutes..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}You don’t feel like you can get as much done when you have a task coming up soon.

The WHO acknowledged however, that identifying all potential contacts remains challenging.  Since the start of the current outbreak earlier this month, 54 cases -  including 35 confirmed instances - of the disease have been reported, mostly in the remote areas of Bikoro and Iboko in the country’s north-west Equateur province. Twenty-five people have died. No new cases have been reported in the past two days. Although only a minority of cases have been reported in Mbandaka, the vaccination effort has to date focused on the densely populated city of 1.2 million due to fears the number of Ebola cases could rise rapidly in an urban environment.Dr. Salama said that take up of the vaccine among people deemed to be at risk of the disease has been high. “The vaccine is proving to be a very acceptable intervention to the community,” said Dr. Salama.He acknowledged however, that the WHO and partner agencies were “still at an early stage in this outbreak response”. He said: “We can’t conclude that we have safeguarded the city of Mbandaka.” Dr Salama did not rule out the possibility of further cases in the city.   The WHO is now expanding the vaccination campaign into the rural areas at the centre of the outbreak. On Monday, WHO began vaccinations in Bikoro, where the outbreak was first declared.  The WHO is also expecting to receive approval in the next few days from the government of the DRC to use five new drugs on patients in Ebola treatment centres. The drugs are all unregistered and will be used as part of a clinical trial.  Dr. Salama said that it was not a simple effort to do this kind of trial in this kind of environment. The WHO hopes that the trial will pave the way for future Ebola treatment efforts. Earlier this month, WHO experts concluded that the current Ebola outbreak did not constitute a “public health emergency of international concern. The health agency is however, continuing to monitor potential locations, including 80 ports on the Congo river in DRC and neighbouring Republic of Congo for new cases of the disease.The current outbreak in the DRC is the worst outbreak of Ebola since the 2014 - 2015 outbreak which killed  11,300 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.Protect yourself and your family by learning more

consumers to boycott ticketing website Viagogo after it was shamed by regulators for failing to make ticket prices clear. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Margot James said to consumers using secondary ticketing websites don\u0027t choose Viagogo - they are the worst.Secondary ticket websites sell seats to concerts and events which are being sold by other consumers who no longer want the tickets, or wish to sell them for a profit. It comes after Viagogo was shamed by the Advertising Standards Authority for breaking UK advertising rules by failing to tell consumers about hidden fees which

The authority said the doors it would be replacing are not necessarily deficient in terms of fire risk assessments.It added: This is not currently a legislative requirement, but this may change following the completion of the current building regulations review.Grenfell Tower fire in picturesSeventy-one people died when a fire ravaged the residential building on June 14 last year.The fire in the 24-storey tower block in west London in June is now subject to a public inquiry. The cladding, installed as part of a multi-million pound refurbishment, has been blamed for the rapid spread of the blaze which began with a fire in a fridge-freezer on the fourth floor.Meanwhile, a report has found that voluntary organisations filled the void left by a lack of official direction in the wake of the disaster.The report, Mind The Gap: A Review Of The Voluntary Sector Response To The Grenfell Tragedy, found that many voluntary organisations stepped up to the challenge of meeting the needs of the community where the statutory authorities fell short, particularly in the early stages.Video: How the Grenfell Tower disaster happenedAlthough they too found it hard to co-ordinate in the early days after the disaster, the report found that the organisations demonstrated effective action in the immediate and longer-term response phases, despite their lack of experience of UK disaster situations.The institutional response to the disaster was badly flawed in the first crucial days, and the damage that resulted has been difficult to repair, the report said, adding that the voluntary sector was very much on the front line.The report, commissioned by Muslim Aid, said: The consequences of the disaster were compounded by the weak leadership of the response initially led by the local council, which was slow to provide direction, co-ordination and information and to address multiple pressing needs.Particularly in the first few weeks, this void was filled mainly by the community itself, supported by an array of local organisations and businesses, as well as inidual volunteers and representatives from external organisations.A Kensington and Chelsea Council spokesman said: We are committed to learning the lessons from the Grenfell tragedy and therefore we welcome this report as part of the learning process.However, it is not right for the council to comment in detail at this stage - this is a matter for the public inquiry which is reviewing the events around the council\u0027s response to the tragedy.It is our responsibility to ensure that the whole, unvarnished truth is told so that lessons can be learned and to ensure that such a tragedy can never happen again.

One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Many others are apparently doing the same in other member states.“These applications for citizenship by British citizens are proof of the huge added value of the public goods and services created by the European Union which these citizens don’t want to abandon: most obviously the four freedoms.”Mr Bettel said the EU did not “want to punish Britain” but that the country could not have “the advantages without the constraints”. “We must have common rules and we must say to UK you can\u0027t have one without the other.”But the country’s PM warned against turning on voters themselves, adding: “Brexit is really a blow for all of us and same goes to Italy.

Digital minister Margot James told BBC Radio 5 Live that fans looking to buy tickets from a secondary site should not choose Viagogo, one of four major ticket reselling firms in the UK, because “they are the worst”. Meanwhile, Trading Standards said on Wednesday that it had been in contact with the Advertising Standards Authority in relation to Viagogo. “As such we have now launched an investigation into Viagogo, which will look at all legal options to bring them into compliance with the law,” a spokesperson for Trading Standards said.Viagogo has previously been censured by the Advertising Standards Authority for “failing to make clear upfront all fees that can be calculated in advance when making price claims”, putting it in breach of the \u0026nbspUK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct \u0026amp Promotional Marketing, known as the CAP Code.The ASA said it had received complaints about how prices were presented on the Viagogo website, with quoted costs not making clear to consumers that they would be expected to pay additional fees and charges when ordering tickets.

The verdict means the Coxes cannot seek monetary damages, court spokeswoman Mary Ann Price said. Gavin Cox testified that he suffered brain and other injuries in a fall while stagehands urged him and others to run during an illusion that appeared to make as many as 13 audience volunteers disappear onstage and reappear moments later, waving flashlights in the back of the theatre. His lawyer, Benedict Morelli, told jurors during closing arguments that the trick was inherently dangerous, and that Copperfield should be held partially liable for Cox\u0027s injuries. Four years ago, attorneys estimated that Cox had that racked up more than $400,000 in medical costs. Copperfield\u0027s lawyers lost a bid to close the courtroom to the public to prevent disclosure of secrets about the illusion. At least 55,000 audience volunteers had taken part in the trick over 17 years, according to Copperfield and show executive producer Chris Kenner. Jurors learned that in about 60 to 90 seconds, stagehands with flashlights ushered the randomly chosen participants past dark curtains, down passageways, around corners, outdoors, indoors and through an MGM Grand resort kitchen to re-enter the theatre for the show\u0027s finale, according to testimony. I was having a good time up until the time I was injured, Cox testified. He recalled stagehands shouting Run! Run! Run! through an outdoor alleyway that his lawyers say was coated with construction dust. Cox, 57, a former chef from Kent, England, said he fell hard on his right side and didn\u0027t remember getting up to finish the illusion in November 2013. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesA worker cleans up the Millenaire migrants makeshift camp along the Canal de Saint-Denis near Porte de la Villette, northern Paris, following its evacuation on May 30.

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears.

US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017.

Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning.

Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland.

Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked.

Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full.

Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017.

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Since joining the US president’s legal team Mr Giuliani has made a series of notable television appearances.This includes making the bombshell admission Mr Trump repaid his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the $130,000 payment to adult actor Stormy Daniels as part of a nondisclosure agreement related to an affair Ms Daniels says she had with Mr Trump in 2006.But Mr Giuliani was later challenged over how his statement appeared to contradict Mr Trump’s earlier denial of knowledge of the payment to Ms Daniels.Mr Giuliani responded by saying the talk of a $35,000 a month retainer was just “rumour” – despite him having said days earlier it was fact.The Republican also revealed the president recently ordered a hamburger – one of his favourite dishes – with just half a bun.He told The Washington Post the duo dined together on 6 May at the president’s golf club in Virginia.While Mr Giuliani enjoyed a light Cobb salad, Mr Trump, whose weakness for fast food has been widely documented, ordered a well-done burger with half the bun, a choice which The Post claims was “in service to his health”.“I do that, too, sometimes. It’s a good way to do it,” Mr Giuliani said.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The financial criss that would ensure would put us back significantly. It would taint Italy’s reputation forever.Addressing populists who have raised fears outside forces are calling the shots in Italy, he said, “We are not constrained by European rules, but by economic logic.”An election is likely to focus on Italy’s relationship with the European Union and in particular the budget restraints imposed on members of the eurozone.A poll by SWG has shown support for the League has jumped to 27.5 per cent, around 10 points up from the 4 March elections, while support for Five Star has fallen about three points to 29.5 per cent. If the two anti-establishment populist parties decided to join forces again, the poll suggests they would have a majority in parliament. Additional reporting by agenciesor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Thats what I want to do now.Both euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal in the UK.Euthanasia, sometimes known as mercy killing, is the practice of intentionally ending someones life to relieve their pain and suffering, while assisted suicide involves the person wishing to die taking an active role in ending their own life.Euthanasia carries a maximum penalty of life in jail, and assisted suicide 14 years.The only exception is passive euthanasia, which is where treatment that might extend someones life is withdrawn - such as a life machine being turned off.The only alternatives for terminally ill patients in the UK are hospice care or refusing treatment, which mentally capable patients have the right to do.As a result, some terminally ill people decide to travel abroad to die.She said she had always known her fathers wishes, and was not surprised at his request.It took seven months of planning to take her elderly father overseas, with the help of son Scott, and Susan said she felt that the clinic was professional and caring.Son Scott added: Its not pleasant to see your loved one die, obviously.It was a sense of relief for him.He was suffering and not facing a quality of life.The family said they were not worried about facing charges over Mr Lentons decision.Sandra said: I am prepared for that, because it was the right thing for my father.It has to be an individuals choice.But she hit back at suggestions that allowing people to be taken to suicide clinics would open the door to abuse.Sandra said: People are very clear about whether they want to do this or not.You cant pressure someone into this. Its entirely them right through the process."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408650365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"apply here for our first summer internship scheme to work for the the number one paper","story":"The internships, for 18 to 25-year-olds, are available in roles including reporting, news-gathering, design and production, across print and online.Placements will last up to 12 weeks and be based mainly in London.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air. Our children are left with the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.The Government is afraid of the mob — but in some areas there is little less than anarchy breaking out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it. Prime-time America. You’re back on’.”And it’s go go go with My 600lb Life.NOTE: In order to avoid Britain’s Got Talent Live, I’m heading south of the border, down Mexico way. Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”. Channel 4’s Goggleboxers and all the other people who seem to think The Handmaid’s Tale is a documentary.Car Share lacking either the brains or the balls to make a preview copy of its finale available.And Good Morning Britain without that oaf Piers Morgan, on Thursdays and Fridays. An experience which really is as pointless and empty as Tight Fit performing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, without Steve Grant on lead vocals.Brilliant performances from Alex Jennings, Patricia Hodge and Ben Whishaw, as Peter Bessell, Jeremy Thorpe’s mum and Norman Scott, on A Very English Scandal.BBC1’s Motty: The Man Behind The Sheepskin, revealing an even odder character than I was expecting. Dave’s How The Young Ones Changed Comedy (not entirely for the better).And The Chase offering up my favourite quiz show moment of the year, so far.Bradley Walsh: “Which astrologer published a colouring book called The Art Of Astrology?” John: “Galileo.” Bradley: “Russell Grant.”Gareth Bale: “I haven’t seen the goal back yet, I’ve only watched it again now.”Steve McManaman: “It’s a surprise that Bale’s not playing, but it’s not a surprise that he’s on the bench.”And Rio Ferdinand: “Win the Champions League and it’s chance to be forever mortalised.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)THIS week’s winner is Britain’s Best Home Cook’s Mary Berry and Gary Oldman as Dracula.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are. Why weren’t we doing this 20 years ago?”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That readiness is absolutely vital to securing a genuinely beneficial deal.We know that Civil Service mandarins want Brexit to fail.They’ve set up roadblock after roadblock in the hope we’ll be forced to cave in and change our minds on the whole exercise.That cannot be allowed to happen.Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he says the PM needs to show some iron, and that Brussels won’t get the money they desperately need unless they play ball with Britain. It’s the only way we’ll focus minds across Europe.Without a plan, we’re only planning to fail.THE calls for abortion reform in Northern Ireland are entirely understandable.It looks increasingly odd that its laws are so out of step with both the rest of the UK and now with their southern neighbour.But Ulster’s abortion laws have always been a matter for the people of Northern Ireland.For devolution to work, Westminster needs to acknowledge the right of the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish to set their own rules.It’s not a pick ’n’ mix depending whether or not MPs agree with them.And the way some Labour politicians have suddenly become dedicated activists to drive a wedge between the PM and the DUP is shameless.The Government’s priority in Northern Ireland must be to restore a functioning Assembly, which has been missing for more than 500 days. Then the province can have an abortion debate.But it is for Ulster, not Westminster, to make any decisions.KYLIE Minogue has had us Spinning Around for decades. We wish the Red Blooded Woman a very happy birthday.If only we could all be So Lucky to look that good at 50.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are supposed to have quality controls.”Kellogg’s suggested Hinay sends them the flake so they can analyse it and find out how it ended up in the packet.They told him the lump was made of a mix of cereal pieces and coating that got stuck together during the production process.A Kelloggs spokesperson said: At Kellogg’s we pride ourselves on making the best food possible.Larger than average flakes can occur during cooking when two or more flakes bind together.We have investigated this matter and we are taking steps to improve the process.We are sorry that on this occasion our shopper’s experience was less than satisfactory.”Crunchy Nut was created by Kellogg’s employees at their Trafford Park factory in Manchester and were first introduced in 1980.In 2008 two US sisters were quids in when they sold their Illinois-shaped cornflake for £1,050.

Five years is an eternity in politics, especially in revolutionary times like the present.Ultimately, it’s up to the British people to decide what they want to do. It would be better however if they came to a decision sooner rather than later.He added that a second referendum would also render Europe a great service by rescinding Brexit and not creating a hard-to-fill hole in the European budget.Mr Soros continued: The British public must express its support by a convincing margin in order to be taken seriously by Europe.The economic case for remaining a member of the EU is strong, but it will take time for it to sink in.But he added that if the EU is serious about overturning Brexit, it should reform to become more flexible.Mr Soros demanded a multi-track Europe that recognises different countries want different levels of integration.Brexit backers today hit out at his comments and said a second referendum would defy the will of the British people.Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns said: George Soros wants to overturn the largest democratic mandate in British electoral history, but in the same breath admits the EU is in an ‘existential crisis’ and needs to change to convince the UK to rejoin.A second referendum would not only damage our negotiating position, but would also send a dangerous signal that Parliament is seeking to ignore the votes of 17.4million people.Mr Soros, a Hungarian-American who is the worlds richest hedge fund manager, has spent millions on political causes around the world.He has been accused of using his cash to defy democracy - but insists he is only trying to promote freedom and stability.After receiving his donation, Best for Britain has launched a national poster campaign and is lobbying MPs directly to support a re-run of the 2016 vote."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004095677631.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"crooks carling beer selfies community service","story":"The trio stopped their gardening task at a ­nursing home to nip to Tesco before having a lager in a snap captioned “Might aswell av a few on unpaid work”.In another Lee Snowden and Matthew Fisher, both 30, give the finger to the camera, while pal Chris Bader writes: “Always taking selfies.”A third photo shows a man with his back to the camera and the words: “Want ur rooms decorating by 7 criminals cheap labour just hide your valuables.”The photos, in which the men have on hi-vis “Community Payback” vests, were taken in ­Bingley, West Yorks, and posted on Facebook.The trio were shopped by a member of the public who saw the pictures online.The men may have to return to court to be re-sentenced for breaching the terms of their community service, during which drinking is banned.

He will find out that it’s not that easy.”But it can also be revealed that Home Office bosses do fear 51 year-old Abramovich “buying” an EU passport from Russia-friendly states such as Cyprus and Malta.It is very difficult to exclude anyone with EU citizenship from coming into the UK.The source added: “If Abramovich bought an EU passport from somewhere like Cyprus, it would be very difficult to keep him out.“It would then be up to the EU to explain what they have done.”Downing Street also said that Israel’s visa waiver scheme would not give anyone the longterm right to work in the UK.The scheme only gives the likes of Abramovich half a year maximum here for leisure or business trips.His £8.6billion oil fortune means he has overtaken Israeli shipping and property magnate Eyal Ofer, worth £6.85billion.Israel grants citizenship to any Jewish person wishing to move there and issues a passport. Roman will also be exempt from paying tax for ten years, sources said.A No10 spokesman said: “Those with Israeli passports are non-visa nationals, which means they do not need a visa to come to the UK as a visitor for a maximum period of six months.“Israelis are required to obtain a visa if they want to live, work or study in the UK.”In a significantly tightening of the rules since the Salisbury nerve agent attack, it is believed the Home Office have demanded Mr Abramovich spell out precisely how he came about his £9bn fortune before his visa is renewed.The bureaucratic questions will take many months, in a retaliatory move designed to heap pressure on Mr Putin.Boris Johnson revealed the Government’s thinking during a hoax call with pranksters pretending to be the Armenian PM last week.The Foreign Secretary said: “I think it is very important for the Russians to know that the UK is absolutely determined to stand firm against them and we will continue to tighten the squeeze on some of the oligarchs that surround Putin.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Whoever is holding one when the music stops gets called up on stage.The Lucky 13 are then suspended in a cage and given torches to shine back at the audience before being hidden from view with a cover and taken off the stage through a secret passageway.They are then told to run down backstage corridors to reappear in the back of the theatre clutching the torches they were given by Copperfield during the trick.But Mr Cox claims he slipped and fell 22ft from the door that lead back into the theatre, injuring his neck and brain.He testified: I was having a good time up until the time I was injured.Mr Cox recalled stagehands shouting Run! Run! Run! through an outdoor alleyway that his lawyers say was coated with construction dust.He said he fell hard on his right side and didnt remember getting up to finish the illusion in November 2013.Afterwards, Mr Cox said he received medical treatment from paramedics and at a hospital for shoulder and other injuries.Two day later, he and his wife and a lawyer returned to the theatre at the MGM Grand and filed an accident report.Copperfield testified that until Mr Cox sued in August 2014, he never knew of anyone getting hurt during nearly 20 years performing the illusion on tour and in Las Vegas.He said he stopped performing it a year later.The magician said he didnt see construction dust on the ground when he passed through the same outdoor alley alone as part of another illusion about 10 minutes earlier.Mr Coxs lawyers brought in three women who testified that they also were injured during the illusion over the years.One included a schoolteacher who said she fell but finished

record numbers - with infestations up by 150 per cent in just two months.Experts are blaming the explosion on warmer weather in April and May after Brits basked in 29C heat.Pest controllers at Rentokil say 50billion more flying ants - 1,000 for each Brit - could sweep the UK causing grief for homeowners.A spokesman said: Experts believe the rise could be attributed to the unseasonably warm start to the Spring - after Brits experienced record-breaking warm weather in April.Last month’s period of clear skies and the hottest April day since 1949 may explain the surge in activity, as ants are typically more active in higher temperatures and colonies use sunlight to navigate.This happens on Flying Ant Day when swarms take to the skies and breed mid-air.The most common type of flying ant is the black garden variety (the Lasius niger), whose nests have a single queen and anything from 5,000 to 15,000 workers.Flying ants are not dangerous insects and are unlikely to bite.Even though theyre harmless, flying ants are still annoying - but fortunately, there are many household items which can be used to get rid once and for all.Spraying with dish-washing soap mixed with water can dehydrate the ants.Asparteme-based sweeter is said to be effective.Combining this with juice to form a paste means the critters will carry it back to their colony - killing off some of the ant population in the process.Distributing some insecticidal powder around window and door openings can also prevent the ants from entering your home.Rentokil also says to clean up after yourself and keep food and rubbish bags sealed tightly.The surge also means Flying Ant Day - when the creatures search for a mate - could be bumped from July to as early as June.The day marks the start of the insects mating season, when millions of the horny critters take to the skies to breed mid-air.But it lasts for much longer than a day - usually lasting for around two weeks.David Cross, head of the technical training academy at Rentokil Pest Control, said: Last month we saw reported ant infestations rise to levels we wouldn’t usually expect until June or July.It’s rare to see ant infestations in cold or overcast weather, and while the ‘Beast from the East’ may have caused them to remain dormant in March, the sudden change in temperature has since brought them out in their droves.This trend could be set to continue throughout the rest of the summer.It comes after Brits were warned of a summer explosion of Asian hornets after reports of the striped terrors turning up in the West Country."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409752963.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pope francis john bradburne saint canonisation","story":"Campaigners are calling on Pope Francis to canonise John Bradburne — who they say performed miracles in the war-torn country.The poet and aid worker wore distinctives monks robes and a Christ-like beard as he cared for lepers in what was then 1970s Rhodesia.But Mugabes Zanu-PF guerillas believed him to be an informant  for the British-backed government and captured him in 1979.Bradburne was marched and tortured — including being forced to eat dog dirt — before he was subjected to a rigged trial.He was offered the chance to leave the country but he refused, insisting that he wanted to return to care for the ill and infirm at the Mutemwa colony.Bradburne, 58, was instead gunned down as he prayed and his half-naked body was dumped by the roadside before being buried outside the capital Harare.Now, supporters hope to raise £20,000 to to pay for an inquiry into his life and the reported miracles linked to him.His niece Celia Brigstocke, 63, is leading the campaign to have Mr Bradburne beatified and then canonised.If successful, he will be the first English person to become a saint in nearly 50 years since The 40 Martyrs of England and Wales — who were executed for treason between 1535 and 1679 — were canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970.John was born in Westmorland, Cumbria in 1921 as the son of an Anglican rector before converting to Catholicism in 1947.The WWII veteran, who bravely served with the Ghurkas in Singapore and Burma, took 16 years to travel the world  and explore his spiritualism.A productive writer, John wrote around 6,000 poems in his lifetime — earning him the Guinness World Record for the most prolific in the English language.He then settled in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe in 1969 where he built a church at the Mutemwa colony and devoted his life to its inhabitants.Bradburne was fiercely loyal to the lepers, even bathing their wounds, praying and sleeping alongside them despite the risk of infection.Among his supposed miracles, mourners at his funeral reported seeing drops of blood below his coffin although there was no blood inside.Supporters also say a man was cured of a brain tumour ten years ago after praying to Mr Bradburne.The Archbishop of Harare, the Most Rev Robert Ndlovu, is said to be supportive of the campaign which could ultimately see him beatified and made a saint by Pope Francis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409742564.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"incredible colour pictures reveal devastation of britains first air raids 103 years since german zeppelins bombed uk cities","story":"The bombing campaign, known as the “First Blitz”, killed 500 people on British soil during WWI.They show how peoples lives in the capital were ripped apart following the first Zeppelin attack on London in May 1915.Pictures in the fascinating collection also show the wreckage of a damaged L20 Zeppelin aircraft after it crashed into the sea off the coast of Norway.The airship was known as the “Raider of Loughborough” after being involved in the attack on the Midlands.The aircraft’s passengers can be seen rowing away from the wreckage.Other images show British soldiers desperately searching for survivors from the wreckage after a devastating raid in London.Another image shows a large sunken hole in the ground where a Zeppelin bomb tore through the ground, creating a deep well filled with rubble and debris.Military personnel and civilians are seen beside the hole as they survey the damage of yet another raid against Britain.One impressively colourised photo depicts a female munitions worker busy in a factory in 1915, before the factories became a key target for the bombing.Britain’s industrial heartlands were heavily populated, and their destruction would affect Britain’s war resources drastically.The incredible shots were colourised by British professional colouriser Tom Marshall of PhotograFix.He said: “Zeppelins were like no other weapon ever encountered before.“They were impossible to spot in the night sky, they flew higher than any British aeroplanes could reach, and were out of range of any guns.“They were the height of luxury travel before the war, but nobody imagined the death and destruction that airships could bring to Britain’s streets during World War One.”From this, the Kaiser authorised bombings on London to happen in February, however these were then postponed until April in the hopes it would be more weather permitting by this time.Once April fell, the bombing raids were delayed further until the newer and bigger P Class Zeppelins were available. This led to the first London bombings on the night of May 31, 1915.The fatal raids at the end of May in 1915 were commanded by the German officer Viktor Leopold Linnarz who ordered an LZ 38 airship to drop explosives over the capital.A total of 120 bombs were dropped from Stoke Newington to as far south as Stepney and as far north as Leytonstone.Seven people were killed and thirty-five were injured in these raids which burned down seven buildings.The damage from this one day of raids was estimated to have cost the government over £18,500, the equivalent of approximately £2 million today.The development of the Zeppelin airship was first pioneered by the German Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin in the early twentieth century, and were they first flown commercially in 1910.During the First World War, the German military made use of the power of Zeppelins by using them as bombers and scouts, killing over 500 people during the numerous bombing raids against Britain.The use of Zeppelins caused death and destruction away from the trenches and allowed Germany to attack the British on their own soil.The Zeppelin raids over London on May 31 forced the British government to issue a D-notice which prohibited any UK press outlets from reporting anything about the raids which wasn’t mentioned in the official statements.In 1921 the Allied Powers requested that Germany hand over all Zeppelins in reparation for the devastation they caused during the war."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004068280204.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa mays latest suggestion to solve irish border issue dismissed by eu as very complicated before it was even presented at brexit talks","story":"The Prime Minister suggested using the so-called “back stop” solution – favoured by Brussels – after the transition period, but for a limited time only.However officials say this idea, where the UK mirrors existing EU rules, would be “very, very complicated” and fear it would only postpone the negotiations on a long-term solution.Negotiators in Brussels have said they think the backstop should be a permanent solution if it is implemented, but Mrs May has ruled it out.Instead she favours a so-called “new customs partnership” to deal with trade issues between Norther Ireland and the Republic once we exit the bloc.But that idea, along with a rival plan favoured by Brexiteers in her Cabinet like Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, has already been rejected by the EU.This latest knock-back by the EU creates further doubt that progress will be made on a border solution at the next European Council summit in June.A senior official told Politico of Mrs Mays time-limited backstop idea: “It would be a very, very complicated thing to negotiate. I really dont see how you get there.”The PM has only recently secured backing from her Cabinet, senior Brexiteers and the DUP for the proposal after weeks of wrangling.From the UK side there are two long-term options being discussed, a ‘customs partnership’ and ‘maximum facilitation’.The first is the favoured model of the Prime Minister, it is a hybrid system which would see the UK collecting tariffs on imports on the EU’s behalf.Supporters say it would allow for a frictionless border but Brexiteers say it is unworkable – with Boris Johnson labelling it ‘crazy’ – and would prevent the UK from being able to negotiate free trade deals around the world after we leave.Mr Johnson prefers the other option, known as ‘max-fac’, as it would take us further outside the grasp of the EU and allow us to strike deals of our own.It would require technological advances to smooth any problem at the border, however some suggest it may breach the Good Friday Agreement.Brussels has dismissed both options as Narnia and has set out a fallback option under which the UK would maintain full alignment with enough rules of the customs union and single market to prevent a hard border and protect the Good Friday Agreement.Mrs May suggested this could be only be a very short-term solution, saying no Prime Minister could ever agree to such terms, as they would undermine the constitutional integrity of the UK.But an agreement does need to be found soon, as the EU have said no progress can be made on other issues like trade without an agreement on Ireland first.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Me and my daughter couldnt even go to sleep last night because we were so scared.I didnt believe in anything like that until I saw this for myself.The medical receptionist said no one had been behind her nine-year-old son Byrin when she took the photograph of him standing in front of a tree.It was only when the family got home and she was looking through her snaps from the day that she realised something was there.She said: When I got home I put the picture on the computer and when it zoomed in and I was able to see it closer, I thought what is that thing behind Byrin?When I zoomed in further I could see a face. But I was like but there was nobody there!It looks like a child to me, I dont know if its a girl or a boy.

Only half? Sounds optimistic to me.But leading the band which once epitomised sex and drugs and rock ’n’ roll — and the debauched history of the Stones is etched deeply into the corrugated faces of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood — is the man who can teach us all we need to know about staying fit.Unlike Mick, we don’t have to take up yoga, ballet and kickboxing — but like him, we do have to think about getting our blood pumping every day of our lives.And unlike Jagger, we do not have to start every day with a smoothie — but we do have to think more about what we are putting into our bodies.Few of us could ever hope to follow Jagger’s punishing fitness regime, working out for hours most days of the week under the watchful eye of personal trainer Torje Eike.We don’t have the time, money or indeed fitness levels to keep up with this great-grandfather.But by having Mick Jagger as a role model, every one of us can be healthier than we are — slimmer, fitter and ready to rock ’n’ roll.The key to Jagger’s fitness is that everything counts.If you put good food into your body or if you eat rubbish.If you make regular demands on your body or just reach for the TV remote.Jagger gets mocked for his action-packed love life (at 73, he had a son with 29-year-old ballerina Melanie Hamrick) and for his laughter lines — nothing is that funny, Mick!But if you saw Jagger bouncing about like a 19-year-old this week, then you could not help but take him seriously.And want a slice of whatever he is having.So the next time the nation has a panic attack about how fat we are becoming, we need to get Jagger on the case.For — at the risk of being impolite — when did you ever see Jamie Oliver looking even remotely slim?But Mick Jagger is still dancing like it is 1969.And you never see a fat Rolling Stone. IT was such a glorious day in Windsor last Saturday that you would think even the hardest of hearts would soften at the sight of young love framed by pomp, pageantry and that cloudless blue sky.But the moaning anti-monarchy minnies are always with us.“Proof again that GB is an infantilised, escapist nation,” sneered Ugandan-born, Oxford-educated commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, 68.Meanwhile, in Wales, Oxfam apologised if a modest royal wedding display in Oxfam’s Aberystwyth shop – Meghan and Harry face masks and some Union Flag bunting – had “caused upset”.But I was on the Long Walk in Windsor with those cheering crowds last Saturday, and I have never felt such a feeling of national unity.The monarchy exists solely with the blessing of the British people.We can divest ourselves of it at any time – as so many countries have ditched their royal families over the past few centuries.But if you stood among those crowds on the Long Walk – who came from every creed, class, race and religion on the planet – then you would believe that the future of the Royal Family is assured for the next 100 years.Anyone dreaming of a republican paradise should not hold their breath.Jada will be an inspiration to anyone suffering from the condition.Because with or without her hair, Jada still looks beautiful.BUCK-TOOTHED Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho is best remembered for two great performances – lobbing David Seaman’s ponytail in the 2002 World Cup and scoring eight times in one night with dancer Lisa Collins.One of these performances earned him the nickname “Pneumatic Drill”. And it wasn’t lobbing David Seaman.You might think that at 38, Ronaldinho’s pneumatic drill was getting a bit rusty, but in August he is to “wed” both his girlfriends, Beatriz Souza and Priscilla Coelho, in a joint ceremony.More three-in-one oil, darling?We are told that Britain should rely on the “good faith” from Brussels.What good faith?When did Brussels ever show anything but contempt, disdain and disrespect towards this country after we voted to leave?The EU’s attempt to shut Britain out of the Galileo satellite project – which we helped to fund – is just the latest insult.If May wants to give Brussels £39billion without a trade deal nailed down, then she should resign today.And make way for someone who will finally stand up for this country.THE Labour Party has suspended local party representative Ian McKenzie for saying that Islamic State would behead Labour’s Emily Thornberry rather than using her as a sex slave.McKenzie, chairman of the Lewisham East constituency, does not deny his crass comments, although some suggest they are being used by his opponents on Labour’s hard Left to discredit him.It sounds like he is doing a good job of discrediting himself.HARRY KANE will be England’s youngest ever World Cup captain – younger even than Bobby Moore.Kane will do a fine job but Bobby Moore beat testicular cancer in his early twenties and then lifted the World Cup at 25.And for any England captain, that will always be a hard act to follow.HOW stark-raving mad that TV historian Dan Snow feels he has to lie to his daughters that women flew Spitfires in World War Two so they feel free to “follow their dreams”.“My daughter was walking down rows and rows and rows of these Spitfire racers and she was going, ‘Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy’,” says Snow.So to protect his six-year-old daughter from what he calls “the grim realities of pre-20th century gender relations”, Snow told her that some women also flew Spitfires in combat.And when I read of Snow’s bizarre lie, I thought of Violette Szabo, who was parachuted twice into Nazi-occupied Europe during World War Two to aid the French Resistance.On her second mission she was captured, tortured by the Gestapo and executed at Ravensbruck concentration camp in 1945.She was 23.Dan Snow has apparently never heard of Violette Szabo – because if he had, then he could surely have told his daughters about her.But many readers will know her incredible story from the film Carve Her Name With Pride.Violette was the working-class daughter of a French mother and a British father.She fell in love with a French Foreign Legion soldier of Hungarian descent called Etienne Szabo, who was killed in 1942 at El Alamein.Violette, who spoke fluent French, trained as a special-operations field agent to fight the Nazis.The torments she suffered before her death are beyond our imagination and her courage is at least the equal of any man who fought in World War Two – and I speak as the proud son of a Royal Naval Commando who won the Distinguished Service Medal.Educate yourself about Violette Szabo, Mr Snow.Then tell your daughters about her.WE all grew up as Star Wars fans but now it feels like there is always a new movie or spin-off coming out.The Last Jedi was only last year and this week sees the release of Han Solo’s back story, Solo. Talk about flogging a dead Wookiee.When Katy Perry is taking to the stage in a C-3PO mini-dress, the exploitation of the Star Wars franchise has possibly gone too far.We’re doomed, Katy.

Muslim Aid chief executive Jehangir Malik, who coordinated volunteers on the ground, said: \"The spirit of humanitarian action displayed mainly by the community itself and supported by an array of local organisations and businesses, as well as individual volunteers and representatives from external organisations, filled the void where there was a lack of official direction, co-ordination and information.\"I would have expected this chaos in a developing country, because almost always there is poor infrastructure."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-european-union-flag_4324114.jpg?20180530120957 ","title":"austria calls for overhaul of eu free movement","story":"As reported by the Austria Press Agency, he said: \"We must discuss openly that it is not good for European development to strip away the entire intellectual, well-trained potential of eastern Europe for western Europe."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-smoke-rises-israeli-airstrike_4323797.jpg?20180529195107 ","title":"gaza tensions may erupt into full scale conflict","story":":: Locked In: The devastating effects of Gaza\u0027s blockadeThe group has as a result been criticised, by some inside Gaza, for recklessly inciting the people it governs to expose themselves to harm.Israel though can also not afford for the protests to continue.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) - the self-proclaimed \"most moral army in the world\" - has faced international criticism for its extensive reliance on live ammunition to stop mostly unarmed protesters from approaching, or cutting the border fence.The status quo remains though the Israeli-led blockade continues and the financial sanctions imposed by the Palestinian Authority are still in place.Although Egypt agreed to open the Rafah crossing for the month of Ramadan, Hamas is still isolated and economically desperate. It is perhaps facing a crisis of legitimacy - this is why we may see an escalation on the military front.Israel says the protests are being used as a \"camouflage for terror\".On Sunday it says its forces discovered an explosive device on the border fence.A Hamas position was targeted in response and three members of Islamic Jihad were killed.Israel was braced for retaliation.

By the time the 1990s came along, shipbuilding, mining, steel production and coal had been pretty much obliterated.People like my father were either unemployed, working abroad or had managed to cling on to work locally.This turbulent period in British history was captured rather well in the cult TV series Auf Wiedersein, Pet, a comedy-drama about a gang of seven British workers escaping the mile-long dole queues in England to take up cash-in-hand jobs in West Germany.Men and their roles in society were changing in a way that would be depicted two decades later in The Full Monty, a film which told the story of a group of out-of-work steel workers stripping to make money and rebuild their self-esteem.:: Podcast: The changing face of the UK:: Podcast: What do robots mean for the future of work? When I say their roles in society were changing, I do not just mean they were at a loose end, I mean they were on a course to live shorter lives than men in the South.My dad struggled to find regular work, accepting short term contracts and working six days a week.By the mid-1990s, interest rates had reached 15% and a lot of families, mine included, were struggling to make ends meet.In March 1995, at the age of 48, my dad collapsed and died in front of me. I was 16.:: Sky Views: Journalists need to get out more:: Sky Views: The importance of remapping Britain I have spent the last few months working on a story about why, in 2018, men in the North are still living shorter lives than men in the South.I have been trying to find out to what extent this shorter life can be blamed on deprivation alone or whether there is such a thing as \"northern machismo\" - or an attitude that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.A doctor told me after my dad\u0027s postmortem, he would have had symptoms to suggest things were not right. I have often wondered why did not he say anything and I will never know.Almost all the indicators we use to measure deprivation are weighted towards the South, including life expectancy, heart disease, cancer rates, suicide, alcoholism, levels of tooth decay, literacy, road investment, wages and GCSE results.You name it, the North fairs worse. But how can this be?:: London is the most unequal place in the country Successive governments have either ignored the problem or deliberately diverted money to the South, where the perceived benefits to the national economy are greater.The reality is that the North-South divide is a black mark on the whole of Britain. It perpetuates inequality of the worst kind, pits regions against each other and neglects those areas of greatest need.Government policy has tried to direct funds through regional development initiatives, enterprise areas and grants, but there is very little evidence to suggest that these schemes have brought the economic prosperity intended.And Brexit won\u0027t help these areas either.:: The robots that could steal your job According to regional forecasts, every area of the UK will suffer a decline in GDP, with the North East taking an 11% hit to economic growth under the government\u0027s preferred outcome of a free trade deal with the EU.Leaving with no deal will result in a 16% dip, and staying in the single market would cause a 3% decline.These areas are as vulnerable today as they have ever been and things have to change.Governments have to take this seriously, otherwise we run the risk of damaging not just one generation, or two, but leaving permanent scars on whole swaths of Britain that have been left to rot because they are out of sight and out of mind."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-meghan-markle-wedding_4314240.jpg?20180518222846 ","title":"meghan markle effect boosts supermarket sales","story":"There was a noticeable spike on the Friday before the wedding in Windsor and Chelsea\u0027s clash with Manchester United at Wembley, with grocers cashing in on \u0026#163415m worth of sales over the 24 hours.Sales of burgers and sausages rose by 39% and 12% respectively, while non-alcoholic beer purchases were up by 64%, during the last month.More than 16.6 million households bought ice creams, while sun care products also flew off the shelves with sales up by 64% on the same period last year.All of the \"big four\" supermarkets clocked up rising sales, but were out-performed by fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl.Morrisons performed particularly well with sales growth of 2.9% ahead of the overall market as it attracted an additional 311,0000 new shoppers through its doors, followed by Asda (2.8%), Tesco (2.2%) and Sainsbury\u0027s (1%)."},{"url":null,"title":"bank holiday activities kids family","story":"AdvertorialFrom gazebos to kids’ tents – how to make the most of your outside space this bank holiday and half termHave a brilliant bank holiday with these ideas from Halfords\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByIan Morris14:23, 25 MAY 2018Updated13:01, 30 MAY 2018AdvertorialGet out and enjoy the upcoming time off\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailYou don\u0027t have to go to a campsite to have some outdoor fun this bank holiday. Your garden or local park can host just as much fun and help you keep costs down too. The trick is keeping everyone busy so the laughter flows and you all finish the weekend happy and re-energised. \u2028We’ve teamed up with Halfords to share some exciting ideas for what you can get up to – without breaking the bank. Get out into the garden  The key for any bank holiday weekend or half term is going to be fending off the inevitable boredom that can grip children – so why not put them in charge? They get to set the agenda, arrange the football tournament and decide if there\u0027s a water fight or not (there will be, so hide the garden hosepipe if you want to stay dry). To help them run the show, get them to help put up a tent to base themselves in.  The Secret Garden kids play tent and Rocket kids play tent are both ideal for getting their imaginations going. You\u0027ll also want to get the little’uns something to sit on, as they lay down the law of the garden. There’s even a Rocket folding kids chair and Secret Garden folding kids chair to match their tents.  Tents and a whole range of other camping gear are half price at Halfords for the bank holiday. Set up a grown-up place to chill  If the sun shows up for the weekend then you\u0027ll want to be able to find some cooling shade. \u2028While the kids are putting up their play tents, the adults can be busy erecting a sanctuary of their own – or kicking back in a Urban Escape King Size Moonchair, above. \u2028Take a look at the Halfords Gazebo with two side panels. Offering a UV rating of 50+ means not only will it offer shade, but it will also help keep you protected from the sun. \u2028\u2028  And if it rains? Don\u0027t worry, the gazebo is waterproof too. \u2028\u2028 A range of gazebos currently have 20% off at Halfords – check them out here.  Pack up a picnic lunch using a Halfords 40 litre coolbox – you can connect it to the mains or keep it charged in your car until you\u0027re ready, and then it will keep your food and drink nice and cool. It has wheels too, so no need to worry about getting it to your destination. And right now there’s 20 per cent off. You\u0027ll need cutlery, plates and something to drink out of too. The good news is Halfords has a four-piece set of acrylic wine glasses (it\u0027s your holiday too!) for just \u0026pound5. Rainbow plates and cutlery are also half price too, so grab the full set and make your park picnic bright and summery. Scoot to the park \u2028The kids can scoot on the Mongoose Stance Stunt Scooter, which is great for all wannabe daredevils. It\u0027s also down to just \u0026pound45 (save \u0026pound18), for the holiday weekend.  Or they can jump on the Slipstream Go Kart, a safe, fast and fun steel-frame go kart featuring wide pneumatic tyres for stability and a handbrake. The go kart, which also has a free wheel to stop pedals turning when going downhill, is now half price at \u0026pound70. Selected ride-ons at Halfords are currently half price.

The Brighton Pavilion MP said it was time for me to show the power of letting go. Ms Lucas, is the party\u0027s first and only MP and has represented Brighton Pavilion in the House of Commons since 2010. She first served as leader of the party between 2008 and 2012 and returned for a second spell as leader on a joint ticket with Jonathan Bartley in 2016. In a piece for , the former MEP said she had faith that a new leadership team will step up to the challenge that our increasingly febrile times present.  Under the rules of the party, leaders are elected to serve a two-year term, with the Lucas-Bartley joint ticket securing more than 86% of the vote to succeed Natalie Bennett. She wrote: I won\u0027t be seeking nominations to be a candidate in this year\u0027s leadership election, when the process starts on Friday, but instead will be focusing even more on work in Parliament and in my Brighton constituency.  I believe that Jonathan and I have shown the power of working together, since we became joint Green Party leaders in September 2016, and it\u0027s now time for me to show the power of letting go. In the general election campaign the Green Party worked with other so-called Progressive parties to encourage anti-Tory tactical voting by withdrawing candidates from certain seats.   Its vote share actually dropped 2%, having been squeezed by a Labour party moving to the left and their total of 524,604 votes meant they didn\u0027t come close to adding to their tally of MPs.  Lucas herself picked up more 30,000 votes in Brighton Pavilion, just over half, and increased her majority from 14.6% to 25.5 %. Earlier this month the Greens made gains in local elections, where the party won 39 council seats - an increase of eight. Speaking at the time, Ms Lucas said the Greens have overtaken UKIP and become the fourth party in English local government. The Green Party has taken a significant step forward with just a fraction of the resources of the bigger parties. We are now established as one of the four major English parties - and an electoral force right across the nation, she said.

Pest experts predict the unseasonably warm weather in the UK, with April 19 seeing Britain bask in 29C heat, the hottest April day since 1949, has led to a surge in the number of ants around the UK. Wildlife experts believe there are more than 10,000 trillion ants in the world - with around 150bn of them in the UK. Taking into account the huge rise in call-out by Rentokill, this year\u0027s ant population could be closer to 200bn - meaning more grief for British householders facing swarms of the pests in their gardens, homes and bins. Because of the huge surge in the number of ants, the number of flying ants - when ants sprout wings and go on \u0027nuptial flights\u0027 in search of a mate - this year is expected to take place earlier than normal. The event, often called Flying Ant Day, despite it normally lasting around a fortnight, usually takes place in July, but this year is expected to take place as early as June.    A spokesman for Rentokil said: There has been a significant increase in ant activity across the UK. Ant-related call outs increased 148% from March to April. Experts believe the rise could be attributed to the unseasonably warm start to the Spring - after Brits experienced record-breaking warm weather in April. Last month’s period of clear skies and the hottest April day since 1949 may explain the surge in activity, as ants are typically more active in higher temperatures and colonies use sunlight to navigate. If the weather remains mild, Rentokil expects higher levels of ant activity throughout the summer period. Ant life-cycles depend on temperature, and the amount of food available to them. Provided the Queen is healthy, and enough food is being brought back to the nest, ant eggs have a greater chance of survival.  Ants can hatch after just three weeks, leading to increased breeding and larger colonies during prolonged warm periods. David Cross, head of the technical training academy at Rentokil Pest Control, said: Last month we saw reported ant infestations rise to levels we wouldn’t usually expect until June or July. It’s rare to see ant infestations in cold or overcast weather, and while the ‘Beast from the East’ may have caused them to remain dormant in March, the sudden change in temperature has since brought them out in their droves. This trend could be set to continue throughout the rest of the summer. He added: If temperatures remain high, we also expect this to really be a bumper year for flying ants, which could manifest itself at ‘Flying Ant Day’ - the ‘nuptial flight’ stage of ant reproduction where swarms of flying ants are prominent.  Some ant nests can last for several years and cover a large area - with anything from several hundred to tens of thousands of ants in each colony. Their size can make them difficult to spot indoors, but ants leave sticky residues on worktops because they are attracted to, and eat, sweet things. If you think you have a problem in your home, it’s always best to seek professional advice. Bosses at Rentokil said that the main food source for ant was sugary secretions from insects like aphids - although many will sneak into homes to feast on sugary deposits from fruit and any food left out. When one any finds a good food source it leaves a \u0027pheromone trail\u0027, which tips off ant pals about a good food source, which can see hundreds and thousands march into homes, often through cracks in doors, windows and through pipes.

But rather than the images of a magician or escapologist that the moniker may conjour, Chesney was a triple killer who scandalised the public almost 70 years ago. Wanted by Scotland Yard for the murder of his wife and her mother, having concealed the murder of his own mother years before, he was finally brought to a form of justice by his own hand shot dead in a German forest. The bullet had gone through his head. Beside him lay a gun and a letter addressed to his German girlfriend, the beautiful Sonia Winnikes, 28. It read: My dear Sonia, By the time you read this letter I will no longer be here. . . You know I am unschuldig [innocent], but with what has happened in the past it would be difficult to prove...  His death brought to an end a two-nation manhunt for \u0027Mr. X\u0027 - a suspect Scotland Yard had asked the German police to help them find. \u0027X\u0027 was wanted in connection with the murder of Chesney\u0027s wife, Vera Isobel Veronica Chesney, 43, and her mother,  Lady  Mary Menzies, 73. The two women were murdered In Sunset House, the old folks\u0027 home that Chesney\u0027s mother-in-law ran in West London. The older woman was beaten around the head and strangled and Chesney\u0027s wife was drowned in a bath - the killer had made sure she had drunk enough gin to knock her out and then lowered her into a bath and lifted her legs so she remained submerged. It emerged Chesney had sneaked into the country from the Continent and then back out again. He hoped that killing his wife would release money held in their marriage. It was a sensational end to a sensational life for Chesney, who had been born John Merrett, which included wartime heroics, a prodigious appetite for for women, food and drink, deception at every turn and murder. And as the story unravelled of who the killer was it emerged deep in his past a earlier crime which was even more shocking - the murder of his mother. John Donald Merrett the man who became known as Ronald Chesney was born in New Zealand in 1908. The family moved to Russia but his mother Bertha found that the climate did not suit John, her only child so she took him to Switzerland.  During the First World War her husband deserted and so Bertha, the daughter of a wealthy Manchester Wine merchant, brought the boy to England when he was sixteen. For a time they lived near Reading and John was sent to Malvern College to train for the diplomatic service. Bad boy When the time came for him to go to a university, Bertha moved to Edinburgh so that her son could still live at home. They took a flat in Buckingham Terrace, near Edinburgh University, where John enrolled as an art student. He was a brilliant scholar but his conduct did not match his brains. His mother,had an income of just over \u0026pound700 a year, out of which she gave John 10 shillings a week pocket money but it was was not enough for young Merrett, who soon tired of his studies. Unknown to his mother he was regularly skipping his lectures to go dancing at the city\u0027s music halls.. At night, he would lock his bedroom door and climb out of the flat by a rope, so as not to rouse his mother\u0027s suspicions. To finance his life of stolen pleasure, he forged cheques drawn on his mother\u0027s bank account - these were the days long before Internet banking and many financial transactions ran on trust. With the money he got in this way he bought a motor-cycle, gifts of jewellery for Betty Christie, one of the dance instructors at the palais which he haunted day and night and chillingly a pistol and ammunition. However he was living on borrowed time and stolen money and the cheques were to catch up with him. Murder It was on March 17- St. Patrick\u0027s Day. 1926 — that the events happened which led to John Merrett\u0027s trial on a murder charge. It was over breakfast when Bertha opened a letter from her bank to find that she was, inexplicably, overdrawn. The Merretts\u0027 maid heard a shot, then a scream and the sound of someone falling in the sitting-room. John went into the kitchen and told the maid he and his mother had quarrelled about money. And he said: My mother has shot herself.  In the sitting-room, the maid found Mrs. Merrett lying on the floor, bleeding from a bullet wound in the right ear. A pistol was on the bureau. Later the same day, John went to his favourite dance-hall, paid the fee to book Betty Christie, and took her out for the day. During a brief spell when she regained consciousness, she had said: Donald (as she called her son ) was standing beside me while I wrote a letter. I said to him: \u0027Go away.\u0027 The next I heard was a kind of explosion. I do not remember anything more. Her son\u0027s account was when his mother told him to go away he went to the corner of the room, heard a shot and saw a revolver falling from his mother\u0027s hand. His mother died a fortnight later. The twist Merrett thought he would be free to live his life how he wanted but in her will Bertha left all she had in trust for her son until he was 25. It was a blow to the young man who longed to have access to his mother\u0027s money and so he quickly wrote a string of cheques against his mother\u0027s account. However, authorities were soon on to him, curious as to how a dead woman was spending so much money, and eight months after his mother\u0027s death he was arrested on a charge of murdering his mother and forging 29 cheques on her bank account. However there were no witness and after a seven-day trial at Edinburgh High Court and a cleverly constructed defence a jury of nine men and six women returned a verdict of not proven on the murder charge.  On the charge of forging his mother\u0027s signature to raid her savings, Merrett was found guilty and sentenced to a year\u0027s imprisonment. The trial of young Merrett was regarded as one of the most sensational murder trials of the century. Love When he was freed, after serving his sentence, Merrett — as he still called himself —found refuge in the home of one of his mother\u0027s friends, Mrs. Mary Bonner, then living at Bexhill. Mrs. Bonner — she became Mrs. Menzies when she remarried after her first husband\u0027s death — had a charming and attractive daughter, 17-year-old Isobel, known as Vera to her friends. Soon they were in love and in March 1928 they eloped and married in Glasgow. However three months later the pair stood in the dock at Newcastle Upon Tyne charged with obtaining goods worth \u0026pound200 by false pretences. Merrett gave their\u0027 names as  Mr. and Mrs, John Chesney, late of Bexhill. They had been living in a tent on the outskirts of the city.  He had signed cheques in the name of McCormick, giving his address as the Grand Hotel when he had no such fortune. Merrett, alias Chesney, alias McCormick , was jailed for nine months. His wife was discharged. The trial was made the subject of a book by William Roughead, who ended the story by saying he had not heard what became of Mrs. Chesney. Then he wrote:  But you never can tell: we may do so yet.... A windfall Two years after leaving prison Chesney inherited the then huge sum of \u0026pound50,000 from his Grandfather and went on a huge spending spree. He and his wife lived for the next decade in the lap of luxury and put \u0026pound10,000 aside for the future in trust should something happen to one of them - it was a decision which would prove costly for them both. A speedboat and a two-seater aircraft - both bought with a view to smuggling - an open top Bentley, a country mansion, lavish entertainment, and a stableful of slow racehorses helped consume his money. But as the money ran out his wife tired of his love of other women and they separated. Desperate to continue his lifestyle he moved to the continent where in the 1930s smuggled drugs and arms on a run between Malta, North Africa, and Spain and spent time in a string of foreign jails. Scotland Yard believed he used his wealthy connection to help smuggle carpets, pictures and art treasure. The war hero The Second World War, when it came, was treated by Chesney as just another opportunity to make a dishonest living and he fast became known as Mr Fixit who could get anything for the right amount of money. As Lieutenant Ronald Chesney, RNVR, in command of a mine-sweeping trawler and no-one knew of his terrible criminal past. In 1954 a former sailor who served with him, Howard Johnson, described him as Hard drinking, 6ft. tall, weighing 22st., with a huge black beard, a large gold ear-ring dangling from the pierced lobe of his right ear, and a real Cyrano de Bergerac of a nose - he was a man of violent action who lived to the full.

Harper Mitchell Hyslop is the only person in the UK, and possibly all of Europe, suffering from a type of children\u0027s interstitial lung disease (chILD) that is so rare that it has no name. While her friends are off enjoying their summer holidays, Harper carries oxygen in a backpack and stays at home with her parents Jodie, 38, and John, 40. Harper, from Balloch, West Dunbartonshire, is left panting like a puppy when the sun comes out because her lungs are so inflamed - and is aggravated in the heat.  At first, her parents were confused about what was happening to Harper when she became ill at just five-years-old. The couple watched their daughter for eight weeks as Harper\u0027s flu-like symptoms were initially misdiagnosed as a virus before being diagnosed with chILD in 2016. Jodie said: Her eyes got really dark, she was having flu-like symptoms. Her lungs had inflamed that much that she was struggling to breathe. She had lost so much weight, she didn\u0027t want to eat and she had lost 10.5Ibs.  She was admitted to hospital and got an X-Ray which showed the results of her lungs. They just didn\u0027t function properly and it becomes worse when it\u0027s warm. She pants like a puppy. You know the same way a dog would have its tongue sticking out - It\u0027s like that. At first, we thought she was having a panic attack as her chest went up. ChILD is a broad term for a group of rare lung diseases causing a lack of oxygen in the blood. But Harper\u0027s condition is so rare to the point that it doesn\u0027t have a specific name.  The interstitial tissues are inflamed meaning Harper has difficulty passing oxygen. Harper had to carry oxygen canisters when she was first diagnosed but she then started taking liquid oxygen from a backpack which Jodie believes lasts much longer. Social care worker Jodie says that her daughter needs frequent rest and is sad that her condition means that she has to miss out on hanging out with her friends. Jodie added: Due to the condition, it means although she can eat properly, she needs to have cool showers.  She tends to rest frequently and she can\u0027t be out in the heat like her friends. She feels sad about that but it\u0027s about trying to teach her how to work with her condition. And she does well with that and she knows when she needs to rest when she\u0027s out with her dad. She loves going on her scooter and going to the park. To cool her down she would eat ice poles and yes it is a bit isolating but she does take it on her stride. Sometimes she feels like she can\u0027t be with her friends.

MPs are calling for a ban on brand-generated characters or licensed TV and film characters which are used to promote foods high in fat, sugar or salt on broadcast and non-broadcast media. Such a ban would mean characters such as Kellogg\u0027s Tony the Tiger and Nestle\u0027s Milky Bar Kid would have to be dropped or used to promote healthier products. And cartoon characters from the latest summer blockbuster would no longer appear on the packaging or adverts for fast food. But characters such as the Jolly Green Giant could continue to be used to promote vegetables.  When TV chef and campaigner, Jamie Oliver gave evidence to the Health and Social Care Select Committee he said cartoons and superheroes should not be used to peddle rubbish. Instead, he said they should be used to promote healthy foods. Meanwhile, the MPs have urged the government to take action on advertisements when it produces its next chapter of its childhood obesity plan. Ministers should ban junk food ads before the 9pm TV watershed, the committee said.  Health campaigners have long been calling for changes to junk food advert airing times - saying that the current restrictions do not apply to family viewing time. Meanwhile, supermarkets should also be forced to remove confectionery and other unhealthy snacks from the ends of aisles and checkouts. And junk food price promotions, such as multi-buy discounts and extra free promotions, should be restricted, the MPs added. The government should also give local authorities more powers to limit the proliferation of unhealthy food outlets in their areas and councils should be able to limit junk food and drink billboard advertising near schools.  The raft of recommendations come in the committee\u0027s latest report into childhood obesity. A third of children are overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school, according to official figures. The group of MPs call for a whole system approach to tackle the issue. This includes a call for the government to end sponsorship deals by brands overwhelmingly associated with high fat, sugar and salt products of sports clubs, venues, youth leagues and tournaments.   Meanwhile, social media sites such as Facebook and YouTube should reduce children\u0027s exposure to inappropriate advertising and marketing, including advergames.  A recent report from Public Health England showed that the food industry has failed to meet a sugar reduction target set by the government. Retailers, manufacturers, restaurants, cafes and pub chains were told to cut 5% of sugar by August 2017. But the report showed that food manufacturers and supermarkets only cut out 2% over the first 12 months of the sugar reduction programme. Puddings had actually increased the amount of sugar and chocolate bars had made no change whatsoever.  MPs called for the government\u0027s next childhood obesity plan to set out further fiscal measures under consideration following the sugar tax on soft drinks. They also called for the tax to be extended to milk-based drinks such as milkshakes. Children are becoming obese at an earlier age and staying obese for longer, said Dr Sarah Wollaston, Conservative MP and chairwoman of the committee. Obesity rates are highest for children from the most disadvantaged communities and this unacceptable health inequality has widened every year since records began. The consequences for these children are appalling and this can no longer be ignored.

Smoke-free areas are expected to be in place in hospital grounds, schools and playgrounds by summer 2019. Strengthening the laws around smoking in public in Wales will further protect non-smokers from second-hand smoke and de-normalise smoking for children and young people, according to the Welsh government. While most schools and hospitals already have no smoking policies in their grounds, it is currently difficult for staff to enforce this.  Health Secretary, Vaughan Gething, has visited the maternity unit at Glan Clwyd Hospital, where staff told him they had received complaints from mothers about people smoking outside the hospital when they enter and leave with their newborns. The changes will make it illegal to smoke in the hospital grounds, with legal backing for fines for smokers breaking the rules, therefore improving the environment for patients, visitors and staff, says the government. Vaughan Gething added: I am proud that Wales continues to be at the forefront of UK action to reduce smoking and prevent young people from taking it up in the first place. We have seen significant changes to the attitudes to smoking since 2007.

Bosses at Tiger Hornsby have condemned the absolutely disgraceful behaviour, which is said to have happened on Thursday night. Staff, who bosses claim were forced to don gloves to clean it up, were left horrified - and shared CCTV footage with other venues to warn them about what happened.  “There were three [tissues] at the bar, some on the floor - one was even stuck behind the cushion as a surprise for whoever was there next,” one barmaid claimed.

Mari Llewellyn, 24, originally from Wales, weighed 17st 5lb before she radically changed her lifestyle and started eating cleaner food. “I’ve learnt what food is nutritional for my body, she explained. I eat more than I did then and some people are surprised by how much I weigh but it’s because I’m tall and I’ve built muscle. Mari, who moved from Newport to New York, US, when she was 10 years old, took up weight lifting as well as adopting a disciplined diet.  She originally started eating a bodybuilder’s diet which was full of high protein food such as chicken and eggs, Wales Online reports. But now, she eats a diet that’s higher in fat. Today, the 5ft 11in fitness blogger weighs a healthy 12st and works out six days a week. In just over a year, she lost 170 pounds – or 5st 3lb. She shares her progress on Instagram, YouTube and her fitness blog, Mari Easy Fitness, and has attracted tens of thousands of followers. Mari said: “It all started when I was in my final year of university. “I struggled with depression and anxiety and I ended up having to drop out and move back home for a bit. That’s when I started to eat lots of pizzas and unhealthy food.  “I decided to make small changes, like eating cleaner food and my boyfriend was really into bodybuilding, so I started to get into the gym. “I went from hating the gym to loving it. Seeing my body change motivated me more.” She added: I taught myself a lot about the gym. I was doing a lot of the same exercises as my boyfriend but then I learnt how to do things that I wanted to do like tone my butt.” Mari, who recently completed her degree in fashion and retail in Philadelphia, has also released fitness programmes called Fit with Mari and a resistance band which sold out online. “It’s something I love doing and I’m doing it full time at the moment,” she continued.  “People think being a social media influencer is easy and all you have to do is post a few photos, but it’s hard work. “I’ve also used some of the things I learnt [at university] which I didn’t think I would do. I had to work on the sizes and the designs and work with prototypes.” Mari puts part of her social media success down to being an ordinary woman who has worked hard for her body. “When you go on Instagram, it can be scary because it’s just full of beautiful women,” she said. “But I think more people can relate to me because I did use to be overweight.

In a tear-jerking video clip, the schoolboy said: It\u0027s OK to talk about how you feel. Being involved in sports and going fishing keeps me active and feeling great. I hope my story helps somebody and remember all y\u0027all are loved and worthy.  Amber said: He never wanted to talk about his Pawpaw and I thought his change in mood came down to him becoming a teenager. I never thought he would do something like this. I had never heard of a kid as young as Jared doing something like this. We were all at my mom\u0027s house. I could tell that Jared was in a bad mood, and when he went into her guest bedroom I didn\u0027t think much of it. She started calling his name and he wasn\u0027t answering her which immediately worried her. She went to open the door and found it locked. She got the key and that\u0027s when I heard her scream. I will never forget that scream - my heart jumped up into my throat. We managed to push the door open and he was on his knees, he had hung himself. His face was black, his lips were purple. He was dead. My mom got Jared down and started CPR.  On the street I saw a man from the Water Department and I yelled, I begged him to call an ambulance. I ran back into the house and my mother had managed to revive him. He at least had a pulse. Within minutes the fire department, the police and the EMTs had arrived and a helicopter had landed in the local baseball field to airlift Jared to the Children\u0027s Hospital in Louisville. We drove to meet him there and before I was allowed to go into the room, the doctors prepared me for the worst. He was unrecognizable. He was hooked up to so many machines and he was intubated. I couldn\u0027t believe that a ten-year-old would want to do this. I felt so guilty that I had missed the signs. Jared was on life support for four or five days and I felt like I was going to lose him. The doctors struggled to regulate his temperature and he had suffered a collapsed lung. They worried he may have been deprived of oxygen for too long and could be brain damaged. Stay-at-home mum Amber described the relief she felt when her son opened his eyes after doctors attempted to pull him out of the coma.

Shocked Hinay Lad thought a piece of the ceiling had fallen into his morning breakfast bowl when he first saw the monster flake lurking inside the popular cereal packet. But when he contacted makers Kellogg’s to report the creepy lump he was sent four \u0026pound1 vouchers and was told to buy a new pack. Hinay, 22, who is studying healthcare at Queen Mary University of London, had just taken his first bite when his dad noticed the Frankenflake.  Hinay said: “My dad saw it in the packet and said ‘what on earth is that?’ “It just looked like a bit of ceiling had fallen into the box. We were like ‘what’s going on here?’ “I thought it was a bit dangerous because it could have been a choking hazard. “It even looks like it could be something from outer space, a bit of meteorite or something.”  Hinay was home for the Easter holidays and was innocently pouring out his favourite breakfast food when the massive chunk appeared out of nowhere.  It was as big as half the size of the cereal box, which his family bought from Morrisons for \u0026pound2.68. He added: “It felt like a rock, if you tried bending it it wouldn’t break.  “That’s why we thought it was a bit of ceiling.  “You could have chipped your teeth on it. “I wrote to Kellogg’s and their explanation was that it occurred in their plant. “I’ve never seen anything like it before. They are supposed to have quality controls!” Kellogg’s suggested Hinay, who lives in Bradford, sends them the flake so they can analyse it and find out how it ended up in the packet. They shipped out a measly \u0026pound4 in vouchers in compensation.

Laura Watson claims the small child can be seen with his hand on her son’s shoulder in the creepy image. The family had been enjoying a picnic at the Plessey Woods Park last weekend when Laura took some pictures of her daughter Charlotte Hill, 15, and son Byrin Watson, nine, climbing a tree with their cousin Jack, 16. However, medical receptionist Laura was left “terrified” when she later discovered the face of another child had appeared behind Byrin, despite no one else being near them in the park at the time.   While originally sceptical of anything to do with ghosts and the paranormal, Laura says the picture has changed her mind as the boy is so clear.  She now wants to return to the woods as the figure has sparked her interest in ghosts but admits she hopes the apparition doesn\u0027t “follow them home”. Laura, from Newcastle, said: It\u0027s very unusual and everyone is really freaked out. Me and my daughter couldn\u0027t even go to sleep last night because we were so scared. My husband is on night shifts and I was alone and I was like \u0027oh God\u0027. I was terrified in case anything had followed us back.  I\u0027ve had people on our Facebook saying they are going to send me prayers.  I didn\u0027t believe in anything like that until I saw this for myself.  Laura had been enjoying the sun with her mum, dad and sister, along with her two children and her niece and nephew when they decided to walk the dogs after finishing their picnic.   On the way back the youngsters came across the large tree and began to climb it - prompting Laura to get out her camera. Laura said: There was no one behind the tree, my daughter or my nephew would have seen them. There was nobody there. There was only us there. It\u0027s very, very bizarre. When I got home I put the picture on the computer and when it zoomed in and I was able to see it closer, I thought what is that thing behind Byrin? When I zoomed in further I could see a face. But I was like \u0027but there was nobody there!\u0027 It looks like a child to me, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a girl or a boy. But I can see this face and it looks like the hand is on my son\u0027s shoulder, which is very bizarre. Some people have said I must have Photoshopped it as they can\u0027t believe it. But I\u0027ve explained that I wouldn\u0027t even have a clue how to do anything like that.  It was literally taken on a phone. I\u0027m rubbish with technology and I\u0027m just not the kind of person to do that. There\u0027s no way that is anything but what it is - you can basically see a face. For someone to be that close to my son, if it was another child, he would have noticed them. I would have seen them and I wouldn\u0027t have taken a picture with another kid behind him. Many have speculated what the figure could be with some suggesting it might be the spirit of a boy who drowned in the woods years ago. Laura said: I don\u0027t know much about the history of the woods but some people are saying that many moons ago a young boy drowned in the river. You don\u0027t know if it\u0027s just hearsay. People are asking if Byrin had a twin and if he died but he had nothing like that. I\u0027ve not had any kids die in my family so it couldn\u0027t be anyone that I know. It certainly isn\u0027t something that I\u0027m familiar with. I\u0027ve never, ever experienced anything like it in my life. It was just a normal day. It was lovely hot day and we were just having fun.

Guerrero is a living hell on earth where residents constantly fear for their safety - and kidnapping, gun fights and murders are every day events on the streets. In one horrifying case a game of basketball among friends ended with one of them being beheaded, according to Doctors Without Borders. The irony is that within the region sits one of the most popular and well known holiday resort names in the world - Acapulco - which attracts almost a million holidaymakers a year, many of them rich Americans arriving at its port on cruise liners. But beyond the bustling beach resorts of Acapulco lurks a dark underworld of criminal gangs who have helped the city earn the title of now being the third most dangerous in the world.  The British Foreign Office currently warns that there have been several instances of armed crime both within and outside tourist areas in Acapulco and warns to be extra vigilant in (the city) and surrounding areas. But it\u0027s advice that few are heeding. In March, hotels in the Zona Dorada, the area overlooking Acapulco Bay, were reportedly at 86% occupancy - whereas the story for those who live there permanently is not so sunny. Territory across the state is fought over by organised criminal gangs, meaning drug-related crime has forced many schools to close and the insecurity and surges of violence have had a direct impact on medical care.  Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) is desperately trying to help people in the region with mobile clinics featuring doctors, nurses and psychologists in 11 communities.   “A lot of doctors don’t want to come anymore (but) the nurses do, thank goodness, says resident Bruno. We haven’t had a doctor for four years, so the MSF visits are essential of course. And it is clear why from the horrific and heartbreaking situations residents are forced to live with every day. A young man in his 20s, who wanted to be referred to as Abel, told MSF medics: “Every so often we see corpses dumped in public places. It’s traumatic to see because people have been tortured and cut up. The beach resorts rose in popularity from the late 1940s through to the 1960s as Hollywood stars flocked to city. John F Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy went on honeymoon there and Elizabeth Taylor married Mike Todd in the resort. Frank Sinatra also sang about it in his popular song, “Come Fly with Me” and Elvis promoted it in his romantic film, “Fun in Acapulco.” One day, when we were playing basketball, a group of armed men arrived at the court. They shot at us, threw us on the ground and took away our mobile phones and money. Then they attacked us with machetes. They took my friend. They cut him up. First they cut off his leg, then his arm. He’d already passed out by the time they cut off his head.” During a meeting with a local health committee in one of the towns in Guerrero, a dozen women described how insecurity had affected their communities. “There’s fear, there’s mistrust, there’s no happiness anymore,” said one of the members.   Tourist dead and another fighting for life after gunman opens fire in packed Acapulco nightclub  “I used to go out at night without any hassle. But now we go straight home. I go to bed and I don’t know what will happen.” Another woman added: “We’re a group of chickens in the coop, we don’t know who’s going to be grabbed next for the pot. Many of the local health centres across the state are now run by just one nurse who also sleeps at the facility. These nurses have very few resources and must carry the burden of healthcare in their communities. Javier Lopez de la Osa, one of the MSF doctors working in Guerrero, added: “A lot of our patients cannot access basic healthcare because of the violence in the region.  “Coupled with problems of ingrained poverty, we see a real lack of follow-up care for pregnant women, which can lead to serious complications and even death in childbirth. “There are hardly any services for chronic diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure. Without medical care, conditions that were previously well managed get progressively worse and eventually become acute, severe and in some cases life-threatening.  The Tierra Caliente, Norte and Centro regions, together with the city of Acapulco, in Guerrero state are some of the most violent places in Mexico .  Los Cabos, in cartel-plagued Mexico, was named the most violent in the world according to the report by Mexican think tank Security, Justice and Peace. Caracas in Venezuela came in second, making it the world\u0027s most dangerous capital city.  Laura Moreno is MSF’s mental health activities manager in Guerrero. “We provide medical and mental care to people affected by the violence in the region, she said. “We run individual and group sessions and psychosocial activities, to strengthen patients’ coping mechanisms and help rebuild the social network damaged by violence. This can be challenging as we only visit each community once a month because of the volatile context. “We carried out 1,270 consultations in 2017, and treat people who have been through very traumatic experiences. Some have had family members killed, and others have family members forced into criminal gangs. People in Guerrero have a tough, fighting spirit, but if the fear and violence persist, the fabric of society could be torn apart. Guerrero’s illegal marijuana and opium trade has been a catalyst for most of the violence across the state, forcing people to emigrate or leaving them cut off for months on end.  Juan, a 61-year-old farmer who visited one of MSF’s mobile clinics, described how drug traffickers had threatened the public transport in his town to divert all economic activity to their territory in the north.  ”If there’s a medical emergency, now we have to pay up to 1,500 pesos to go in a private van,” he said.  The daily wage is between 120 and 200 pesos. “It’s a terrible situation nobody wants to spend three and a half hours on the road to reach an available public transport. And we cannot go at night because of the risk of being attacked on the roads. “We see things happen, but we cannot talk about them,” Juan told MSF staff.  “Our house was attacked by armed men a few months ago. My sons aged ten and eleven were also there. They’ve been frightened and traumatised ever since. We can’t leave them alone anymore.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i want end holidaymakers say","story":"News\u0027I want it to end\u0027: Holidaymakers say British dad fell to his death after jumping over Dalaman Airport balconyAndrew Westlake, 30, from Co Durham, died after falling to his death in Dalaman Airport in front of stunned British tourists\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByChris kitchingSophie Doughty11:25, 30 MAY 2018Updated13:19, 30 MAY 2018NewsAndrew Westlake, 30, died after falling from a ledge at a Turkish airport (Image: Facebook)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British dad who died at an airport in Turkey plunged about 50ft to his death after jumping over a ledge inside the terminal and claimed he just wanted it to end, say traumatised witnesses. UK tourists have told of their horror after watching the man fall to his death at Dalaman Airport as they prepared to fly home following beach holidays. A holidaymaker said the dying man, named by his devastated family as Andrew Westlake, 30, from Annfield Plain in Co Durham, told a Thomas Cook Airlines worker, who rushed to his aid, that he just wanted it to end. Andrew had reportedly been waiting three days for a flight home after losing his ticket, and had allegedly been removed from a Jet2 plane shortly before the incident. He had been on holiday in south-western Turkey with his girlfriend and one-year-old daughter - their first family holiday together - and members of his partner\u0027s family, but was alone when he fell.  His aunt, Pauline Butler, told ChronicleLive that her family was notified of Andrew\u0027s death by Durham police on Tuesday, but they haven\u0027t been told exactly how he died. She said Andrew\u0027s grief-stricken mother June, 54, is heartbroken and can barely speak. Family members had been reading news reports and contacting witnesses who wrote about the incident on Facebook to learn more. Multiple witnesses told  that initial Turkish media reports - that Andrew died after falling from a plane\u0027s exit onto the tarmac - were not true. A 29-year-old woman from Watford, who was flying back to the UK with her 34-year-old partner and their three children, aged two, four and six, said the incident happened inside the terminal around 3.30am local time on Tuesday. The family were among dozens of Britons queuing to check in for flights to Stansted Airport in Essex and Birmingham when they heard a loud noise as the man apparently ran and crashed into a glass barrier of a balcony.  The woman, who was preparing for a delayed Thomas Cook Airlines flight to Stansted, said they turned around and saw the man on the floor near the barrier just behind them. She added: My partner said \u0027Are you OK\u0027 and tried to give him a hand, but he didn\u0027t speak. My partner watched him stand back up and he backed away from the barrier and then just ran for it and hopped over straight down onto the floor below. Initially, I think he tried to do it before but he hit the glass barrier - the noise that we heard - and fell, and then tried again. When my partner helped him up he looked so sad and lost. The image that my partner still has in his head is the man looking so desperate. She called out to him and alerted airline staff as he lay on the floor about 50ft below and people rushed to help him. The woman also called out to airport staff, but it appeared they didn\u0027t understand English, she added. She said of the Brit who fell: He was looking up at me and ... he was talking but I couldn\u0027t hear what he was saying. He was too far down to hear anything. Everyone was in shock.  She said the man had his passport but he was not carrying any luggage. A doctor eventually arrived to help the man and paramedics later took him away in an ambulance, she added. An image posted online and verified by witnesses shows the moment Andrew went over the glass barrier. A 23-year-old woman from Hertfordshire told  that her 24-year-old boyfriend was one of the first to reach the Brit after he plunged from a ledge inside the terminal. The woman, who was also preparing for the flight to Stansted, said: Everybody was queued up and just behind us was a ledge, with a glass wall, going down to the floor. He jumped over the ledge. My partner went down there with someone else to see if he was OK.  He was still conscious when they got down there, he was still moving and he was responding to them, but he was a bit out of it. The woman said a Thomas Cook Airlines worker appeared to be the first person to reach Andrew as he lay on the floor. The woman added: When we spoke to the airline representative who went down there, she said that he was saying to her that he just wanted it to end. She didn\u0027t know what he meant by it. She added: It was very traumatising for everyone that was there, especially my partner. Everyone was so in shock. The airline worker was great, she was down there super quick. The airport security, all of them were just standing there. No one else responded to it quickly.  After falling from the ledge, Andrew was treated at the scene and rushed to a private hospital, where he died of his injuries, it was said. Turkish media reported that he had lost his ticket and spent three days at the airport waiting for a flight back to the UK. When he was finally due to fly home, he was removed from a plane over flight safety concerns and prevented from travelling, the reports added. Andrew had boarded the flight around 3am but was ordered off the plane after he got into an argument with cabin crew, according to reports. Witnesses said his unkempt appearance suggested he may have been at the airport for some time. The holidaymaker from Hertfordshire added: He didn\u0027t look in the best of ways. His clothes were quite dirty. The woman from Watford added: He was dirty. There was another lady there that said he had lost his ticket and was trying to get home. She said he walked past her and ... he might have been sleeping rough.

Amber Traxler, 33, is speaking out alongside her son Jared after in a bid to raise awareness around mental health and suicide prevention. Jared had tried to take his own life in June 2016, exactly one year after he discovered his 53-year-old grandfather, Jake Meyers, dead in bed when he popped to his house to borrow a fishing rod. Jared, of New Haven, Kentucky, USA, struggled to cope with his grief in secret until he attempted to take his own life at his grandmother\u0027s house ahead of a summer. Mum-of-five Amber says she will never forget the moment she discovered her son hanging in a bedroom after attempting to take his life.  Amber and her mom Tilly Meyers, 53, became worried when they discovered Jared had locked himself into a guest bedroom and was not responding when they knocked. After discovering Jared\u0027s lifeless body, full-time mum Amber called for help as his grandmother Tilly got him down and began performing CPR. Jared was airlifted to Norton Children\u0027s Hospital in Louisville where he was placed in an induced coma and remained on life support for five days. Doctors were unsure of how long Jared had been deprived of oxygen and feared he could be brain damaged. But Jared survived and he has now spoken out in a bid to help others who are struggling with their mental health. In a tear-jerking video clip, the schoolboy said: It\u0027s OK to talk about how you feel. Being involved in sports and going fishing keeps me active and feeling great.

It’s definitely significant.“It’s across the whole ward. I’ve also had reports from the Charleston and Wellbank areas.”Mr Malone added: “There’s nothing to suggest at the moment that it’s anything to do with cleanliness.“I raised concerns about vermin when the new bins were rolled out last year.“Council officers are aware of it and they’re going up to take a look and see if they can find out what’s causing it.“Hopefully other councillors will keep a close eye on their wards to stop any further outbreak.”Brian Baird, operations manager for Eliminate – a pest control service which works in Dundee – said the most likely cause of the infestations was the rats having a plentiful food source.He said: “The usual reasons for them being in an area would be a food source – obviously around places such as takeaways that deal with food a lot or if there was somewhere else that food had been left.“The best thing to do to try to prevent rats is just general housekeeping – being vigilant.”Mr Baird also warned people not to ignore signs of rats because there are a number of illnesses that can be passed on to humans through the rodents’ urine or faeces, notably Weil’s disease.Weil’s disease is a form of a bacterial infection also known as leptospirosis that is carried by animals, most commonly rats and cattle.A spokesman for Dundee City Council said: “Pest control officers have attended the site and will revisit later today for further investigation and action where necessary.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d1f489e53b-478x564.jpg ","title":"clarks goals can leave dundee united in good nick ex teammate believes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHis allegiances these days lie on the other side of the street but Bobby Mann looked on with approving interest as Dundee United fixed up lower division scoring machine Nicky Clark last week.As well the fact he’d like to see his home city back with two Premiership clubs, the former Dundee defender’s attention was sparked by the fact he’s a former team-mate of the new Tangerines striker.And he believes he’s exactly the type Csaba Laszlo needs to get United to the top flight.After leaving Dens Park in 2007, Bobby joined Peterhead and it was during his time at Balmoor his and Clark’s paths crossed.He’s quick to point out, though, back then the there was little indication the teenager he first saw in action would go on to get the goals he has.“I remember him coming to Peterhead, on loan from Aberdeen and then being signed up when he was released by them,” he said.“With us he wasn’t a striker but operated in midfield. He was obviously an attacking player and I think he scored a few goals but he never played right up front.“That might have been because he was young and, when he first arrived, Aberdeen just wanted him getting games. Because we had Martin Bavidge as the main striker, he wasn’t going to get in the team right up top.“Saying that, I’m pretty sure Nicky regarded himself as a midfielder back then and I don’t think there was any thought of moving him forward.”After two seasons and eight goals, Clark moved on from the Blue Toon to Queen of the South in 2011 and, in terms of goals, has never looked back.Whether it was having former Rangers and Hearts front man Sandy as his father, or the foresight of someone at Palmerston, Bobby acknowledged the decision to make him into a striker was a masterstroke.“His dad has obviously had an influence on his career and he might have pushed for him to go up front, or maybe it was just something someone else saw in him that made them think they should give it a try. Either way, it was a great move for him and a player that gets the goals he does is probably just what United need right now.”The fact Clark is a player who knows the Championship well, having played there for Queens, Rangers and now Dunfermline, is a big plus.United now have a few members of their squad who are used to the rigours of the second tier and, for Bobby, that’s the way to go.“When I played in the lower divisions, the teams who were successful were usually ones who had players who knew the league.“United have brought in Nicky and, assuming he’s back fit for next season, they’ll have James Keatings just behind the main striker.“I thought he was a very good signing when he joined up last summer but the season was ruined by injuries. If he’s back, though, you are talking about a player who’s got goals at that level for quite a few clubs now.“These are the type you want – once you go up you worry about a team for the league above.“If you build a team for the league you’re in and get out of it, you find a few of the boys you did bring in are capable of doing well at a higher level.“Some won’t be and will have to be replaced but you are always going to want to freshen the squad each year.“With Nicky, only time will tell how he does if United get back to the Premiership, but he’s a proven scorer in the Championship and, right now, that’s the most important thing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/03/5abe00fa671c1-848x564.jpg ","title":"confirmed dundee rename dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee FC have completed a historic deal to rename Dens Park in a sponsorship deal.As the Tele exclusively revealed last week, the ground will now be officially known as Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park for the next two years, when the Dark Blues hope to have moved into a new stadium beside Camperdown Park.Managing Director John Nelms said: “We are always looking for new unique revenue streams and this is a fantastic opportunity for the club and it makes it even better that it is with Richard and Kilmac who are and have been lifelong supporters of the club.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d1e2cc7499.jpg ","title":"dundee council calls last orders on pub after revoking its licence","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee licensing chiefs have called last orders on a Hilltown pub after revoking its licence to trade.Boyds Bar closed its doors suddenly earlier this month, having been trading at the Rosebank Street premises for nearly a year.A spokeswoman for Dundee City Council confirmed that the licence for the venue had been revoked as there was no designated manager at the premises.The pub has gone through as many as four owners in recent years.Previously called McAdams Bar, it was rebranded Boyds Bar earlier this year.Events including a medium night had been held at the pub as recently as last month.One former patron claimed the pub had “barrels” of potential, saying: “I’m aware that the premises have changed hands a number of times in recent years.“It was called Boyds Bar for a number of years before it was changed to McAdams and rebranded Boyds Bar.“It’s always sad to see a pub close but I was aware it had been struggling to make a go of it.“Given the right management it still has barrels of potential to be a great local for residents.”The closure comes amid tough trading conditions for Hilltown pubs after The High Corner on neighbouring Kinghorne Road failed to attract new suitors following its closure last year.Janet Hood, who runs Janet Hood Consulting and represents publicans in licensing cases, said any change to a designated manager within a public house would require the owner of the business to notify the licensing board within seven days.She said: “Not knowing the full circumstances of this particular case, it is hard to ascertain what exactly has happened.“You have to have a designated manager – that is the law.“There could be a number of reasons to change the designated manager, whether the person is sacked, loses their personal licence or passes away.“As long as you notify the licensing board within seven days you have six weeks to replace the person or you are no longer allowed to trade.“I tell all my clients for all intents and purposes to have two personal licence holders at all times.

My first one was about Banana being very serious but Orange wanting to have a party.Banana was furious when he came home and Orange had all the fruit and vegetables over for a party.Orange had to say sorry.I also did all the drawings for my book and my Grandad Kelly said it was brilliant.My school is Newport Primary and I am very lucky to have great friends – Zerah, Eva, Darcey, Ava-Ruth and all my classmates.They love getting to hear my stories at homework sharing time every week.Just now, I am writing stories about my class. I put jokes in too.Sometimes people don’t laugh but my mum/editor says this happens all the time, even to comedians, so I shouldn’t let it bother me.My first class story was about how we were all kidnapped and there were no teachers around so the pupils saved the day.My second story was about how we lost someone and I found him and saved the day.In my third story, we were all locked in and had to be saved by the primary ones.My next story will be called “Chaotic Classroom”. I think you know what happens there!I have been inspired by lots of different people including Pamela Butchart, Roald Dahl, my brother Conor, who is 10, David Walliams and my classmates.My dad always shows me comics and tells me all about the Marvel Universe. I love these films.Even though I am only writing small stories, the good thing is that I’m learning all the time.Even great authors make mistakes and all you have to do is fix them.When I am older and have written some books, I hope you will read one of them.I had a great time telling you all about my love of writing.Thank you for reading my column.

I am very impressed by your penguin designs and delighted to hear that they were inspired by watching Blue Planet II. How fabulous that they were chosen for the sculptures and for such a worthy cause.“Congratulations and thank you for writing to let me know. With best wishes, David Attenborough.”Rebecca, who is a massive fan of Sir David’s nature programmes, said, “I was very excited to receive the letter as I didn’t expect a reply.“I felt honoured as I know he’s very busy. It was very nice of him to take the time to read my letter and respond.”Rebecca said that after watching Blue Planet II she wanted to raise awareness about plastic polluting the world’s oceans and she hopes her design will show the “good side and the bad side” of the sea.“I hope people who come to see the High School penguin like the design but can also take away a deeper message,” she added.Rebecca’s winning design is being painted on to the blank sculpture by F6 pupils Morven Wright, Joanna Brunton and Lily Bircham . After being given its make-over, the statue will then join 79 others on display on the streets of Dundee and beyond from June 29th in the Penguin Parade, a charity public art event that aims to raise enough money to fund the Maggie’s Centre Dundee for a year.And the entire High School community is getting behind the campaign. In addition to the design contest, the School has also already staged a Bingo Night and held a Penguin Day in the Junior Years and Nursery, with more fundraising events to come.The school’s Charities and Community Outreach Co-ordinator, Karlene Douglas, said, “Rebecca’s entry was chosen as the winning design for our penguin sculpture because it is both visually stunning and incorporates an important environmental message about our planet.“David Attenborough’s documentary series was a crucial inspiration to Rebecca’s design and so as a school we were delighted when he responded to Rebecca’s letter, congratulating her on winning the competition.“We are proud to support the Maggie’s Penguin Parade and look forward to seeing our finished sculpture outside the school gates.”Maggie’s Centres provide free practical, social and emotional support for people with cancer and their families and friends.

These were implemented into policy and practice alongside further recommendations made by other internal and external stakeholders.One of the key proposals was a cessation of consensual search and a presumption of the use of statutory search powers.The authors suggested these should be targeted in order to end misunderstanding about the purpose of consensual searches and the public’s right to refuse them.Police Scotland’s Code of Practice for Stop and Search was introduced in May 2017 through the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016.

fundraising event will be the Lee Welsh Memorial Match which is to be held at North End Park on June 9 at 2pm.Organised by Lee’s childhood friend Steve Martin, 27, it will also raise funds for DAMH.Steve said: “Lee and I grew up together and played football for many years with Fairmuir Boys.“I decided I wanted to do something in his memory and raise money for DAMH at the same time.“Owing to our shared past playing football together, I decided a charity match would be appropriate.“I’m getting together about 30 of Lee’s mates and we will form two teams to play the match.“I really hope this proves to be a success, because I would like it to become an annual event.“I am having a trophy made for the winners and there will also be a man of the match award.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"man

landmark are retained.Developers say they are “blending 12th Century monastic architecture with 21st Century environmentally-aware construction techniques”.Pat Millar, a representative on the Arbroath Locality Partnership, said: “Housing-led regeneration projects are a key component in our vision to make Arbroath a better place to live, work and visit.“It’s also about improving the town’s

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place. It attracts local and visitor alike, and often the anglers act as unofficial guides for visitors. We have been co-operating on the project.\"Last autumn, the artists showed a specially commissioned film of the river at Inverness Railway Station and invited people to share their stories, views and reminiscences, said Highland Council which is backing the project.Mr Surtees added: \"The work aims to complement the river and people\u0027 relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"A thin ribbon of stone starts as an access, becoming a path to run along for a child, a bench for reading a book, a viewing point up and down the river, a back-rest for looking across it.\"Professor Jim Mooney, chairman of the independent evaluation panel said: \"Our members were unanimous in their enthusiastic response to the reworked proposal.\"The panel was impressed by the expansion of the site to include the opposite bank and by the elegance and innovation embodied by the new design.\"It is our settled view that the proposed structure will greatly enhance the natural beauty and flow of the Ness and will attract locals and visitors alike to explore new ways of relating to and engaging with the river.\"Councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, chairwoman of the Inverness City Arts Working Group, said: \"It is pleasing to see how My Ness embraces both sides of the river and I am confident that it will enhance the location and be very well received by everyone.\"The River Ness Public Art Project which includes other smaller art work is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).

Inverness economist Tony Mackay has suggested that a trick was missed in the 2018/19 budget.In the wake of a plea from council leader Margaret Davidson for the public to lobby MPs and MSPs for an increased annual grant, Mr Mackay believes much more could already have been done.\"It needs to do more to balance income and expenditure,\" he said.\"I have friends in the council\u0027 finance department who tell me it should be possible to cut spending by a further 10 per cent to 15 per cent without a significant impact on services.\"Regarding expenditure, the two main categories are care and learning (\u0026pound430 million) and community services (\u0026pound117 million).

But there\u0027 a big need to increase revenue for the care budget, particularly as the local population is ageing and many more people need care.\"Wednesday 30 May 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04101000/04101605.jpg","title":"New community cafe for Merkinch","story":"\u0026nbspA NEW caf\u0026eacute in the heart of an Inverness community is aiming to become a much-needed social hub for the area\u0027 residents.The Coffee House has opened in the Bike Shed in Merkinch in a joint partnership involving the Methodist Church and King\u0027 Fellowship which runs a successful coffee shop in a converted fish processing factory in the Smithton Industrial Estate.The facility, in Grant Street, will open initially Wednesdays to Fridays between 10am and 3pm serving barista-made coffees at affordable prices but the aim is to extend to a fourth day and also to open in the evenings.Chris Dowling, pastor of King\u0027 Fellowship, said surveys had revealed residents felt the area desperately needed a caf\u0026eacute.\"We hope mums will call in on their way back from dropping off the children at school, as well as others in the community who might feel lonely or isolated,\" he said.\"Part of the vision is to create the best coffee shop in the Highlands in the heart of Grant Street but also a place for the community to meet.\"Wednesday 30 May 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04102000/04102991.jpg","title":"New riverside artwork unveiled","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspArtists Sans facon and OSA unveiled their design - two curved walls on either side of the River Ness at the Little Isle Pool, Fisherman\u0027s Car park - this morning.Tristan Surtees of Sans facon said the work aimed to \"complement the river and people\u0027s relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"For more details see tomorrow\u0027s Inverness Courier.Let us know what you think of the design at newsdesk@spp-group or on\u0026nbspthe Courier\u0026nbspFacebook page.Wednesday 30 May 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04103000/04103871.jpg","title":"North Coast 500 to star in new book","story":"\u0026nbspAN award-winning Highland photographer with a dream of creating a crowdfunded book of the region has smashed his fundraising goal.John Baikie is overwhelmed by the support he has received, with more than \u0026pound6400 pledged to help him create a photographic tribute to the North Coast 500.He had to raise \u0026pound6000 in a month for the project to go ahead.\"I am absolutely delighted to get there so quickly,\" he said.\"It is great news.

He pinpointed Neale and insisted he was an “outstanding” player who could walk into any top team in Europe.Still a teenager, Neale proved that in Munich.Willie said: “I have so many happy football memories of Neale, but also so many other great memories because he was such a great guy.”Neale made his Aberdeen first team debut on October 11 1980 in a 2-0 defeat of Kilmarnock at Pittodrie.He partnered Willie at centre-back in that game because Alex McLeish was out injured at the time.Willie said: “Neale broke through very early in his career and was just a wee lad.“He always had that talent and I think he had the eye on the sweeper’s position but I had to persuade him to move into midfield.“Neale and Neil Simpson were an absolutely magnificent combination.“Neale was an Aberdeen boy brought through and developed by the club and given the big chance to shine.“And he certainly did that.”Following that debut, Neale would go on to win two league titles, four Scottish Cups and the League Cup domestically.“Tattie” would add the European Cup Winners’ Cup and Super Cup in 1983 as an integral part of the only Scottish team to win two European trophies.His first trophy success came in 1982 with a 4-1 Scottish Cup win over Rangers after extra-time.With the Reds 3-1 up at Hampden, Neale, just 18, scored an iconic goal.He smashed a shot into an open net in front of the Rangers end, before punching the air \u0026#8230 and then doing a forward roll.Neale made 220 appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 10 goals, before transferring to top flight Aston Villa in 1986.He would go on to play for Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline Athletic and Ross County.In a successful managerial career, Neale guided Ross County through two successive promotions.As manager of Hartlepool he took the side to the play-offs for the second tier.Neale would also go on to manage Gillingham and Peterhead before returning to Hartlepool in the 2011-12 season.His final trophy success with Aberdeen was the Scottish Cup in 1986 – a 3-0 win over Hearts at Hampden.Fellow midfielder Jim Bett played alongside Neale in that cup final win.Jim, speaking from his home in Iceland, said: “Neale was a great guy to have in the dressing room as he was always upbeat and telling jokes.“He was a great footballer and also a great guy.“We played together in the Aberdeen team that won the Scottish Cup in 1986.“Alex Ferguson left the following season and that was the start of the team beginning to break up.“The boys who had played under Sir Alex had won everything and perhaps needed a new challenge.“Neale went down to Aston Villa and one or two others went elsewhere.“He played for a few other clubs but his heart was always in Aberdeen.”Neale signed schoolboy forms with Aberdeen under Billy McNeill in the 1977-78 season.He was such an exciting talent Neale made his debut for the Aberdeen reserves at the age of just 14.On turning 16, Neale was secured on a full-time contract at Pittodrie by Sir Alex Ferguson.He would go on to conquer Europe before he was out of his teens.Jim said: “It was some achievement for a player to come through the youth ranks at Aberdeen and then win European trophies.“Neale won everything domestically with Aberdeen and was a key part of that side that won two European trophies.“Alex Ferguson was a manager who gave young players a chance and at that time there were a few of them coming through at Pittodrie.“That was very fortunate for Aberdeen.“Neale went on to reach the heights with Aberdeen and lift European trophies.“It was fantastic to see a young player from the city go on to have so much success.“Neale achieved so much during his career.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/05/roadmap-632x564.jpg

parents can go off into the community, and visit the shops, or buy an ice cream, or whatever they want to do.“It’s not a tourist attraction, but it will do no harm to have an extra thing in the

places in the town as well.”Plan for new north-east skatepark backed by council officersCouncillors handed the plans for the skatepark a major boost last week, as the Marr area committee offered its support to BSG to pursue a lease for the land.On the committee vote, Russ said: “We’re absolutely delighted.“This is a major step forward for us.”The land is listed as “for the common good”, meaning that it is not owned by any party.Due to this, the BSG will have to seek permission from a sheriff to gain the lease, which requires a community consultation to be undertaken, and then to seek planning permission from Aberdeenshire Council.Russ, who has lived in Banchory for 10 years and has three children who all use the existing ramp, regularly updates the skaters in Banchory about the progress of the park.He said: “They’re all really excited about the prospect of the park, but of course, they’re really impatient, almost as bad as me.”BSG estimates that the park will cost between

morning.Scotland begin the bid to reach Euro 2020 later this year with Nations League ties against Albania and Israel in September.Scotland legend Willie Miller believes Shinnie has the pressing game needed for those clashes.Reds’ defender Scott McKenna secured his third straight cap in starting in Lima but his handball led to the penalty for Peru’s opening goal.Miller said: “Shinnie can play in competitive games like Euro qualifiers.“He plays in an area where Scotland have a lot of players (midfield).“However, Shinnie brings a different dynamic to the midfield in terms of the way he plays.“He leads that pressing pack for Aberdeen and is the first one to try to win the ball back which is an important element of the modern-day game.“Particularly if you are looking to press the game and win the ball back early.“There are two games coming up against Israel and Albania where Scotland should be desperate to get the ball and have as much possession as they can.“Shinnie adds that dynamic of physical enthusiasm to the midfield that would serve Alex McLeish and Scotland well in top competitions.“He has plenty of experience as well.“The manager can only give him a chance and he has the experience so there is no reason why he cannot take it.”Shinnie was introduced as a second-half substitute for Hibs’ Dylan McGeouch with 15 minutes remaining.Shinnie had been in previous Scotland squads but had yet to be capped. He was an unused substitute in the 1-0 friendly loss to Holland at Pittodrie last November under then interim boss Malky Mackay.Dons great Miller, capped 65 times, said: “I am delighted that Shinnie has been given a chance as I see what he gives to Aberdeen.“He has been outstanding and is someone that leads by example.“You are talking about the captain of the team that have finished second in the Premiership in recent seasons and has played in cup finals.“Shinnie has also lifted the Scottish Cup with Inverness Caley Thistle.“You are not talking about an untested player and he deserves the opportunity to show he is good enough at international level.“Shinnie merits it for the station he holds within Scottish football and on performances.“He is definitely of a high enough standard.”Shinnie was one of seven players securing a debut Scotland cap in Lima. Peru extended their record unbeaten run to 13 games courtesy of goals either side of half-time from Christian Cueva and Jefferson Farfan.Dons defender McKenna played for 90 minutes. The 21-year-old’s hand ball conceded a penalty for the opener.It came from a blunder from debut keeper Jordan Archer where Farfan’s shot struck the Don’s elbow.Miller said: “The standard McKenna has set himself for a young lad is incredible.“He is still young and still learning the game.“Yet out of nowhere he has burst on to the international scene and looks as if he has been playing there for years.”Former Aberdeen midfielder Kenny McLean, who will return to parent club Norwich this summer, earned a fourth cap.Boss Alex McLeish praised the seven new caps for coping with the conditions.McLeish said: “I’m proud of the mentality they showed in a cauldron of a place.“They embraced it.“Bringing these guys into the team for the first time, they handled it really well.“It’s a squad where everybody deserves a cap.“It was hot out on the surface, especially when you’re doing a lot of chasing, which the Peruvians made us do.“Peru are a super team, they move it about well and know each other inside out.”McLeish’s depleted squad are set to be reduced further with some players leaving ahead of the friendly against Mexico.He said: “We’re going to lose a couple of players now.“Lewis Stevenson is going away.“We had an agreement with him to play the first game.“Matt Phillips is going back to England for an engagement there, which we agreed a couple of months ago.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 18","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/05/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,According to a report that appeared in your edition of April 27, a traffic accident occurred on the A83 near Lochgair at 2.30pm on Saturday April 21.It is further reported that the A83 between Lochgilphead and Inveraray was closed to traffic \u0026#8216while investigations were carried out\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 before re-opening \u0026#8216in the early hours of Sunday April 22\u0026#8217.Even if the early hours is taken to mean, say, 1am on the Sunday morning, this suggests the principal route for access to and egress from Mid Argyll and Kintyre \u0026#8211 as well as the  ferries \u0026#8211 was arbitrarily closed by police for some eleven and a half hours.I would like Police Scotland to explain why this was necessary.I well remember a retired police officer telling me that, in the days prior to Argyll entering the stranglehold of Strathclyde Police, the local superintendent would want to know the reason why if the scene of an accident was not re-opened to traffic within about 30 minutes.Police Scotland should understand that (a) the usual excuse (lengthy closures are necessary in order to gather information thought useful in prevention of similar accidents in the future) will not wash (b) perusal of any half-decent road map will reveal to Police Scotland that, unlike the central belt, Argyll does not have a multiplicity of short alternative routes suitable for use as diversions and (c) their one-size-fits-all approach is a negation of management.If Police Scotland is so keen to glean evidence relative to a traffic accident they might also look at actual or potential accidents resulting from these enormous diversions \u0026#8211 fatigued drivers \u0026#8211 drivers unfamiliar with diverted routes \u0026#8211 difficulties finding overnight accommodation \u0026#8211 insufficient fuel \u0026#8211 appointments missed and so on and so on.Eric Box, XxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxSir,You may recall that I incurred a ruined tyre while driving through the roadworks at Strone Point on the A83 back in February.I claimed for £270, which was the cost of the rescue and renewing the tyre, against the trunk road maintenance contractor, BEAR Scotland, who had let the road deteriorate to such a dreadful state while road improvements were going on.While they haven\u0026#8217t admitted liability or anything as rash as that, they have, on the other hand, offered to pay me £250, most of the expense I incurred.I have accepted this offer and I thought you might publish this as an encouragement to others who have suffered expense for similar reasons.It pays to complain.Graham Thomas, St CatherinesSir,Having held a successful evening of music at the Argyll Inn in Lochgilphead on Friday April 27, the Easy Club would like to thank a number of people and organisations.Thanks to the ownership/management/staff of the Argyll Inn and the donators to the prize draw the Co-op, Danny\u0026#8217s, Dalriada DIY, the Smiddy, Fyne Living, ABC Bookshop, the Archway and Marmalade Deli.Also all the helpers and carers, and the many musicians, and the enthusiastic audience who came along to enjoy the evening.As we start to plan workshops for the coming months we would be very happy to welcome new participants. Just email hugh.fife@yahoo for more information.Hugh Fife and the Easy Club committee, LochgilpheadSir,I am a visiting researcher, being privileged to undertake fieldwork in the Ardrishaig and Lochgilphead areas over the past three years.I was shocked on arriving at Ardrishaig recently, for 2018 fieldwork, to discover that the former Gleaner oil depot, a known local breeding site for the UK Amber-listed common gull as well as oystercatchers and black guillemots, is undergoing major development, with complete and utter disregard for these breeding birds.I implore the developer, Scottish Canals, to temporarily postpone this work until the birds have finished breeding for the year and, longer term, to design a mitigation plan for these birds going forward.Otherwise, Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 credibility as an organisation that claims to care about nature will be seriously eroded.Andrew Tongue, Doctoral Research Ornithologist, University of BirminghamSir,I would like to call for all Argyll and Bute schoolchildren to put their thinking caps on for Barnardo’s Scotland fundraising Hat Day.We are asking teachers, child carers, parents and pupils throughout Argyll and Bute to sign up for Hat Day and wear a fun hat to raise money to support some of Scotland’s most vulnerable children.Hat Day, celebrated on Friday May 18, encourages children to wear or make a hat signifying who or what they would like to be or do when they grow up.It could be a firefighter, police officer, chef, astronaut, medic or sportsperson for example. There are no rules or limits to the imagination – they may want to be a wizard or superhero.If a child does not know what they want to be they can decorate their hat with something they are passionate about such as a sport, graffiti art, dancing shoes, or musical instrument.The idea behind the fun is to raise money for the UK’s leading children\u0026#8217s charity to help give thousands of disadvantaged children a better future. When they go into school, nursery or playgroup on May 18, parents and carers can make a voluntary donation of £1 to £2 to Barnardo\u0026#8217s Scotland.Children are full of surprises, and this is a fun way of allowing their imaginations to run wild in a way that will be inspiring, educational and raise money to help transform the lives of children who desperately need our support.It is easy to sign up on our website where you\u0026#8217ll find lots of resources and ideas to ensure your fundraising Hat Day will be a huge success and help support the children and young people we support in your local community.To register, visit www.barnardos.org.uk/hatday. Here you\u0026#8217ll find everything you need to make the event a success at your school, nursery or playgroup.Our resources section has school posters, sample letters for parents and hat-making guides. Contact regional relationships manager for Scotland, Jennifer Keegan on Jennifer.Keegan@Barnardos.org.uk for further information or assistance.To help with ideas, Barnardo\u0026#8217s is launching a separate \u0026#8216Top Hat\u0026#8217 competition for teachers/parents for best hat in the run up to Hat Day, with a poll to decide the winner on the Barnardo\u0026#8217s Community Fundraising facebook page.Martin Crewe, director for Barnardo\u0026#8217s ScotlandSir,I write concerning the blight of ferry disruptions across my council ward, particularity on the island of Islay.We cannot allow CalMac\u0026#8217s management blunders and lack of funding from the Scottish Government to act as a ball and chain which is holding back my local ward\u0026#8217s fast industrial growth.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the UK.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Whitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid. The list, published by recovery firm 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, claims the “nerve-jangling lottery” has put Ayr on the map for all the wrong reasons. It follows a \u0026pound3.5m scheme to increase lanes and install traffic lights on the roundabout in 2006, which has sparked trouble for many trying to negotiate its contours ever since. Transport Scotland held a safety review in 2015 after stats showed Whitletts was more dangerous than the giant M8 roundabout at Hermiston Gait near Edinburgh.  Ranjen Gohri, spokesman for 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, said: “Britain is famed for its roundabouts, and being able to safely negotiate them is a major part of driving in this country. “Unfortunately, many motorists are terrified of them. “This is not helped by some of the cases we’ve gathered that have a fearsome reputation and seem to almost unnerve drivers before they even get to them. “With the volume of traffic and unavoidable problems such as breakdowns, driving in the UK is difficult enough without having to attempt some of these roundabouts from hell.” Also making the top ten is Sheriffhall, which sits on Edinburgh’s city bypass, and Haudagain in Aberdeen, which is due for a \u0026pound30m redesign later this year.

At the time, Games Centre was the only Scottish business to win a gaming award at the 2013 MCV awards. One employee of the Irvine store said on Facebook: “I’m sorry I haven’t messaged anyone back regarding the Games Centre Irvine situation but I can now say the store is officially closed. “This information is as much as I know. “Thanks for everyone’s constant support and it’s been great to meet everyone and share stories and memories with you all.  “To all my staff I have worked with throughout the years you have all been very special to me and I’m glad to have shared the time I did with you. “You are all fantastic people and I look forward to seeing what journeys lie ahead for you.” Retail rival GAME, which operates a branch in Irvine’s Rivergate Shopping Mall, paid tribute to Games Centre and offered to honour pre-orders. A post read on Tuesday: “Unfortunately today it has been confirmed that Games Centre has had to close after more than 20 years serving the gaming community here in Irvine.  “With the loss of a fellow retailer we wish to extend a helping hand to any customers who have pre-ordered games with Games Centre. “Present your pre-order slip in store and we will either honour the pre-order directly if the game has been released or exchange it for a deposit for the product with us in store here if the product is still to be released. “Those weren’t easy to write, I have known Games Centre since The Forum days and I wish you all the best going forward - the uniforms differ but the passion is the same!”   Read more news from Irvine and Kilwinning   "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12321370.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/mwr_ayp_240917Shankland.jpg","title":"ayr united goal machine lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United goal machine Lawrence Shankland hails his best weekend in footballAlthough the 29-goal striker didn’t play in their title-winning match against Albion, he played a huge part in Ayr finishing top.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:33, 2 MAY 2018Updated16:59, 2 MAY 2018NewsLawrence Shankland wins the PFA Scotland League 1 Player of the Year Award (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGoal machine Lawrence Shankland has hailed his best weekend in football. Although the 29-goal striker didn’t play in their title-winning match against Albion, he played a huge part in Ayr finishing top.

The prolific hitman said: “Winning the league was brilliant, but the way we won it was special. “Winning player of the year put the icing on the cake. “It’s the first senior title I have won – I won under-20 titles but nothing like this.  “I have never even been nominated before for a player award, so it’s quite surreal. “It’s probably the best weekend in my career, and I will never forget it.” But despite celebrating the title and looking forward to life in the Championship, United fans are nervously waiting to hear if Shankland will commit his future to Ian McCall’s side. He said: “I don’t know what the future holds yet, mainly because we didn’t know what league we were going to be in. “We haven’t even spoke about it yet — we are still focused on the celebrations, to be honest.”  “The fans have been incredible all season and have always turned out in big numbers. “Especially away to Alloa, the turnout was just amazing. “The support have been amazing with me and have taken a real shine to me. “I have played well for Ayr and the fans have obviously recognised that, and it’s good to play for those fans. “This is my highest scoring season, but I was gutted not to get 30. “Although if I had a chance to get 30 it would have been in the play-offs, so I was happy to stay at 29.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

South Ayrshire officials are to spend the summer soul searching in a bid to find a plan B for their Riverside project. And it could be the end of the year before the scheme is dragged back on track. It comes as new figures showed \u0026pound527,000 has already been blown – without a brick being laid. A “workstream to explore the options” was this week set to be approved, following rejection of a new \u0026pound11million office block. But a report on where to go next will not come before councillors until August at the earliest – after they return from their summer holiday.  Critics labelled the timetable “an insult” as the project threatens to plunge into crisis. Norman McLean, chair of Fort, Seafield and Wallacetown Community Council, said: “This is totally unacceptable. “What we need now is to fast track ideas and utilise the talents of those who can help. “Some ideas are simple and some are more complex, but we need urgent progress.” A “limited competition” open to a handful of “innovative design companies” is among the options favoured by Mr McLean. He added: “At this rate, we will be in December stuck in exactly the same position.” Conservative opposition leader, Councillor Martin Dowey, said: “We are sleepwalking our way into a disaster and nobody at the top seems willing to accept reality.  “Any suggestion that this can be kicked into the long grass is an insult. “It seems a case of crossing our fingers and hoping for a magic cure. “The sooner the council wakes up to what’s happening here, the better.” The Ayrshire Post contacted South Ayrshire Council last week for a statement on the \u0026pound527,000 spent thus far on the Riverside project. A council spokesman said: The expenditure is in line with expected costs for a project of this size and includes design team, project management and advisor fees, surveys and statutory consent.

Ayr’s historic Tam O’Shanter Inn will invest up to \u0026pound80,000 in the al fresco patio to the rear of its property. The boozer, run by David and Mareena Cowan, had gained council planning permission last month. But environmental health bosses this week said a “high chance of noise issues” was causing concern. “It would be remiss of us not to make an objection on these grounds,” they added. Pub boss David, addressing South Ayrshire’s licensing board, said: “We totally understand the concerns.  “But there will be no music played and this is purely and simply about serving teas, coffees and beer until the 10pm curfew.” David said the beer garden would, in the short term, be self-contained at the back of the Inn, which first opened in 1749. A longer term plan to gain access from the rear of the bar/restaurant would then be put in place. He added: “We see this as a good chance to generate extra employment for around five or six people. “The investment will run to between \u0026pound70,000 and \u0026pound80,000 – and not many people are investing in Ayr town centre at the moment.” David confirmed that six CCTV cameras would be installed to monitor the beer garden for security.  He said: “We envisage it being a safer environment than at present, as there can be quite a few issues there. “Perhaps this will encourage any undesirables to go elsewhere.” A limited range of draft beers, wines and spirits will be available at the bar, said David with all other alcohol served inside the traditional pub. Licensing board member, council leader Douglas Campbell, said: “It is welcome investment for the town centre and I’m sure it will be properly supervised.” The decision to approve the license was approved unanimously.

A shiny, newly constructed bus terminal would be half a mile across town to Burns Statue Square. And the historic train station would be prised apart from the Station Hotel and rebuilt as a modern standalone hub. The dramatic vision, which is only one of the options being considered, would also see a chunk of the hotel knocked down and the remainder converted to homes. The multi-million pound makeover of the town’s transport infrastructure depends on businesses such as Stagecoach and ScotRail buying into the idea. Parkhouse Street, which is home to a number of high-profile estate agents, would be pedestrianised in one option.  And the dual carriageway A70 leading from the Market Inn roundabout into the town could become single lane in either direction. Folk had the chance to see the ideas from Ayr Renaissance at a public exhibition in the Town Hall last week. Ayr Renaissance chair James Knox said: “We want to give everyone the chance to have their say on the masterplan for Burns Statue Square. “Nothing is written in stone. We have just begun the consultation process.” A council spokesman said: “We’re at the start of a process looking at options to regenerate Burns Statue Square and the Affleck’s block site, one of Ayr’s hidden gems behind the town hall. Some initial options were pulled together for the consultation last week, however we’re keen to hear more ideas from the public, so we’re looking at additional exhibitions in the near future.”  Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “This is a good opportunity to get on and regenerate Ayr town centre, which is badly needed. There are multiple issues that need to be addressed and we need all stakeholders to put the interests of Ayr first and foremost. “These are ideas that we can work with and shape to make Ayr better. But these improvements will only happen if we all pull together.” Consultants Ironside Farrar have been working on designs. Concerns have been mounting over the future of Ayr’s railway presence as the state of the Station Hotel continues to deteriorate.  The hotel owners have been told to carry out essential maintenance by the council and were slapped with a dangerous building notice. There are still question marks over the future of the Odeon amid speculation it could move to another location in the town. Office building Burns House has been labelled as not fit for purpose and is due to be demolished. But the new replacement building plans for the bottom of the town have been knocked back – throwing the office relocation timescale off. The timeline and budget for the Burns Statue Square makeover has not been released. Stagecoach and Network Rail did not reply to Ayrshire Post requests for comment before our deadline.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness.

Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of!

Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie.

The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise!

Neighbours have slammed fast motorists in the Heathfield area and also in Whitletts Road. One resident claims an existing speed camera on Whitletts Road currently isn’t in operation and insist vehicles are zooming past her home at speeds of up to 50mph. She is calling for a speed camera further along the road to curb fast drivers. The concerned woman has called for the camera between Whitletts Road and Mainholm Road. Speaking at this month’s North Ayr Community Council, she said: “I am convinced the speed camera in Whitletts Road is not switched on. “I can hear cars at 6am or 7am travelling at more than 30mph coming into the town and the same going out.  “We need a speed camera.” Councillor Ian David said: “I am waiting for a response from the Partnership Panel as speeding in Whitletts Road was mentioned and it will be taken up with the police.” Speeding was also a hot topic discussed at last month’s Newton and Heathfield Community Council held in Newton Pavilion. Community councillors highlighted problems with speeding cars in Alderston Avenue and Northfield Avenue, and the problem of these streets being used by drivers as rat run to avoid the traffic lights in Prestwick Road. One woman said: “(There is) speeding in Alderston Avenue and there are a few children who stay in that street at the corner and the cars are turning right on to Northfield Avenue.” Police attending the meeting said they would do their best to monitor the situation. A council spokesman said Police Scotland/Safety Cameras Scotland administer speed cameras: “Safety cameras in Scotland are operated under the rules and guidelines of the Scottish Safety Camera Programme.”  A Police Scotland spokesman said: “The speed detection cameras are rotated around camera housing sites and have the ability to be used at any time. “You can find more information on the Scottish Safety Camera Programme and the location of camera sites by visiting www.safetycameras.gov.scot” In March, the Post reported that more than 13,000 speed offences have been captured on Ayrshire’s roads over the past three years Fast drivers were caught 13,103 times racing through the streets at breakneck speeds across the county from 2015 to 2017. And the highest clocked by a speed camera during that period was in 2016 at 140mph. Over last three years, a total of 715 speeding offences were detected in Ayr, 227 in Troon, 116 Prestwick, 32 in Maybole, 105 in Girvan and 88 in Cumnock.

Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12611218.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PCP_SDR_SCOTRAIL018JPG.jpg","title":"troon beach revellers face travel","story":"NewsTroon beach revellers face travel chaos as ScotRail services to Glasgow Central hit by signalling faultScotRail has announced that a signalling fault is causing cancellations and delays to its services between Ayr and Glasgow.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson14:48, 28 MAY 2018Updated16:23, 28 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of boozed-up teens face being stranded in Troon this afternoon after train services to Glasgow went down.

of the wheels.\nJoni Fairburn discovered a nest on top of one of the tyres of her Volkswagen Tiguan last week.\nAnd inside were three eggs.\nThe vehicle had been parked outside Joni\u0027s Abbotsview Drive home for five days after being serviced.\nAnd the blackbird, dubbed Bonnie by Joni\u0027s children, took full advantage by not only building her nest but also laying three eggs.\nMum-of-two Joni, who runs her dog grooming business from home, explained: \"The car had been in for a service on the Friday and we decided to give it a rest for a few days as it had been clocking up a lot of miles.\n\"Unknown to us Bonnie took advantage of the situation to build a nest on the rear tyre of the car.\n\"It was pure chance on the following Wednesday that I spotted it before driving the car again.\n\"I noticed a lot of debris at the foot of the wheel and lifted the nest not realising what it was.\n\"But when I saw the eggs I put it straight back as I was worried Bonnie would just abandon it if it was moved.\"\nJoni contacted the RSPB for advice.\nBut was told that moving the nest would inevitably be the end of Bonnie\u0027s eggs.\nShe added: \"I spoke to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and they said if I needed the car I should contact the council who would remove the nest but the eggs would be destroyed so I was not having that.\n\"Bonnie seems very contented and oblivious to the fuss but it has been a major talking point amongst the neighbours and the kids pop out from time to time to have a chat with her and make sure she is okay.\n\"Fortunately I work from home so not reliant on the car, so it\u0027s the bike for me for the next few weeks.\n\"On the plus side I have got a Tough Mudder assault course coming up so I can use the break from driving to get plenty of training in.\"\nJoni will be without her car for around a month as the two-week incubation period will be followed by a period of another two weeks before the chicks will fledge.\nAnd in some cases the parents may decide to do it all again with a second brood.\nBonnie\u0027s tyre residence is just the latest in a long line of bizarre nesting spots.\nAs the nesting season takes off, birds are setting up homes in hanging baskets, tool boxes or even washing on clothes lines.\nThe Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said nests have been found in post boxes, rubbish bins, clothes-peg bags and even the pockets of jeans left hanging on the line too long.\nHanging baskets are a particular favourite with wrens, while many birds make use of garden ornaments or buckets.\nBlackbirds have been found on nesting on car wheels, blue tits have set up home in communal ashtrays and mistle thrushes have nested on a set of traffic lights.\nIntentionally damaging nests is a criminal offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, and can lead to adult birds abandoning the site.\nIf chicks are still in the nest when it is abandoned by their parents, they are likely to starve, the charity warned.\nRichard James, wildlife adviser for the RSPB, said: \"Most people would be horrified if they disturbed a nest, so we\u0027re urging everyone to be mindful at this time of year.\n\"Bear in mind that any nook or cranny could be a nest site \u0026ndash they may not be obvious but you\u0027d be surprised what creative housebuilders garden birds can be.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Roxburgh air cadet  19  named best in country","story":"A ROXBURGH air cadet is on cloud nine after being named one of the top in the country.\nBorders College student
