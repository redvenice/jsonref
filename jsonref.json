A country must stand on its own feet.\u0027Khan, 65, a former cricket legend, was sworn in as prime minister on Saturday after his party swept to power in last month\u0027s election.A firebrand populist, Khan\u0027s appeal has soared in recent years on the back of his anti-corruption drive, which has resonated with young voters and the expanding middle class in the mainly-Muslim nation of 208 million people.But Khan has inherited a host of problems at home and abroad, including a brewing currency crisis and fraying relations with Pakistan\u0027s historic ally, the United States.Imran Khan is sworn in as Pakistan\u0027s new Prime Minister...Imran Khan is elected Pakistan\u0027s new Prime Minister three...Share this articleKhan did not shed any light on policy plans to deal with the currency woes that analysts expect will force Pakistan to seek another International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout. Instead, Khan focused on debt and said former central bank governor Ishrat Husain would lead a task-force to drive austerity.Criticizing what he called the colonial-era mindset and lavish lifestyles of Pakistan\u0027s ruling elite, Khan announced he would live in a small three-bedroom house instead of the palatial prime minister\u0027s residence.Khan plans to have only two servants instead of 524 reserved for a sitting premier. He also announced plans to sell a fleet of bullet-proof vehicles to help Treasury shortfalls, a bold move in a country where Islamist militants still pose a threat.\u0027I want to tell my people, I will live a simple life, I will save your money,\u0027 he said.          The former cricket star called for the rich to start paying taxes and said Pakistan will begin an austerity drive to reduce debtKhan appealed to overseas Pakistanis to invest in the country and urged the wealthy to start paying taxes, a perennial problem in a nation famous for tax dodging and where less than 1 percent of the population files income tax.\u0027It is your responsibility to pay taxes,\u0027 said Khan. \u0027Think of this as a struggle, that you need to pay tax for the betterment of your country.\u0027Khan said Pakistan was in grave danger from the effects of climate change and promised to reduce some of the world\u0027s highest maternal death rates and infant mortality rates.He also spoke passionately about the need to help 22.8 million out-of-school Pakistani children in a nation where the literacy rate hovers above 40 percent.Khan, who has never held a government position, named his 21-person cabinet over the weekend, opting mostly for experienced politicians.Opponents criticised the choices, saying about half of the cabinet had served under the former military dictator Pervez Musharraf and were part of the old guard. On Sunday, Khan announced he will oversee the interior ministry.A former playboy of the London social scene who has since adopted a pious persona, Khan said he wants Pakistan to build a welfare state akin to some found in the West, which he said are modelled on the ideas first voiced by Prophet Mohammad in the holy city of Medina.\u0027I will spend money on those who God has not given enough to,\u0027 he said.

Bennett claims she pushed him onto the bed, removed his pants and performed oral sex on him. She climbed on top of the 17-year-old and the pair had sex, according to the notice of intent.The age of consent in California is 18. The document, according to the Times, also included three photos apparently taken by Bennett during the encounter which showed him and Argento, both half naked, in bed together, although only one of the photos showed their faces.Argento later posted on Instagram that she\u0027d had the: \u0027Happiest day of my life reunion with @jimmymbennett xox.\u0027 \u0027Jimmy is going to be in my next movie and that is a fact, dig that jack,\u0027 she added.She shared several more pictures of herself and the teen on that day, including a photo of herself hugging the teen in what appears to be the dining room of the hotel. She captioned it: \u0027My son my love until I will live @jimmymbennett marina del ray 05.2013.\u0027Bennett said that as he headed back to his parents\u0027 house in Orange County he felt \u0027extremely confused, mortified, and disgusted.\u0027Yet a month later, he sent Argento a tweet which read: \u0027Miss you momma!!!!\u0027 along with a photo of an engraved bracelet she had given him to commemorate the movie.           Bennett was just 17 when he claim that Argento performed oral sex on him and slept with him in her California hotel room in 2013.

And yet you did it anyway. #perpwalk,\u0027 he tweeted in May.Bourdain, 61, and Argento met during the filming of his travel show Parts Unknown in 2016 and began dating a year later. Shortly before he was found hanged in his French hotel room, a paparazzi caught Argento dancing in a Roman restaurant with French reporter Hugo Clément. They were also pictured holding hands and hugging on the streets of Rome.Bourdain committed suicide on June 8, five days after the photos first appeared online. Argento\u0027s friend and fellow Weinstein accuser, Rose McGowan, released a statement after his death, saying that the couple were in a \u0027free relationship\u0027 and \u0027loved without the borders of traditional relationships.\u0027Argento was devastated by Bourdain\u0027s death and released a heartbreaking statement following his suicide, where she described him as \u0027my love, my rock, my protector.\u0027\u0027I am beyond devastated.

Morris is also known for his music photography including pictures taken of the Sex Pistols          Fashion Shoot, Brixton Market, London, 1973, by Armet Francis. Armet Francis was born in Jamaica in 1945 and was ten years old when he left for Britain. After leaving school at 14 he started to work as a freelance fashion and advertising photographer at the height of the swinging 60s, and towards the end of the decade he started to chronicle London’s black communities          Carnival Sound System, London, by Armet Francis. Francis was interested in representations of the black Diaspora on a global scale, and returned to Jamaica in 1969 to start a cross-cultural project entitled The Black Triangle, photographing black communities in Britain, Africa, and the Caribbean. His work is shown at the Tate, Museum of London and Victoria \u0026amp Albert Museum          Untitled, from the series The Black House, 1973-1976, by Colin Jones. In the early 1970s the name ‘Black House’ became associated in the public consciousness as the lair of infamous con artist and murderer Michael de Freitas (also known as ‘Michael X’). Though not connected to de Freitas’ former home, the Harambee project was located less than a mile from it          Untitled, from the series The Black House, 1973-1976, by Colin Jones. Colin Jones, who was born in London in 1936, followed an unorthodox trajectory to become one of the most celebrated photographers of post-war Britain. He spent his childhood in the working class areas of East London while dancing for the English National Ballet. Jones bought his first camera running an errand for ballerina Dame Margot Fonteyn in Japan          Untitled, East End, London, 1970s, by Tex Ajetunmobi. Bandele Ajetunmobi – known as ‘Tex’ –was  born in Nigeria in 1921. In 1947, at the age of twenty-six, he stowed away on a boat from Nigeria where he was an outcast on account of  having polio as a child. He settled in Spitalfields, East London. Most of his work was destroyed when he died in 1994 apart for around two hundred negatives his niece  rescued.

Pictured above is a scene from his film showing a home being destroyed          Kensinger, who has been documenting New York’s changing waterfront for the past decade, explained to DailyMail.com that his film focuses on Oakwood Beach, Ocean Breeze and the Graham Beach communities where residents spent tens of thousands of dollars rebuilding after the storm. Pictured above is a scene from Kensinger\u0027s film showing a home being destroyed          Hundreds of those residents who rebuilt on Staten Island accepted a buyout deal from New York state.

I think that was one of the most surprising things during this process, to see how quickly they returned to nature.’          Kensinger added that rising levels will dramatically impact more than 100 coastal neighborhoods and reshape the 520-mile coastline in New York by the end of the century. Pictured above is a scene from the film showing a levee built to protect the areaHe explained that his film is ‘meant to immerse viewers in this process so that they can feel like they are in it.’Kensinger added that rising levels will dramatically impact more than 100 coastal neighborhoods and reshape the 520-mile coastline in New York by the end of the century.‘I think the process of managed retreat is one of the most forward-thinking processes in New York City, in terms of addressing sea level rise and climate change,’ he said.‘And I think we are going to see this process unfolding in other parts of the city in years to come as we decide that we can’t live in neighborhoods on the waterfront here. With these three communities, it’s a sad story of what happened during Sandy, and it’s a difficult process to watch to see them demolished.‘But it’s also somewhat positive to see that the land is being returned to nature and will become a protector or buffer zone for other communities that are nearby.‘So you’re seeing these communities torn down and these neighborhoods disappear, but at the same time you’re seeing it returned to nature and hopefully it will be healed. Hopefully the coastline will become somewhat safer.’Kensinger’s short documentary film is set to premier August 25 for the Rooftop Films Summer Series in New York City."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/21/17/4F46CA1F00000578-0-image-m-14_1534869121235.jpg","title":"Britain UK step Brexit negotiations continuous talks","story":"At a joint press conference, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab (left) and Michel Barnier (right) declared that talks would be taking place \u0027continuously\u0027 from now onMr Raab is due to give more detail about Britain’s preparations for such a scenario tomorrow when the Government begins publishing technical notices on its ‘no deal’ plans.He and Michel Barnier met in Brussels for the latest round of talks, with the latter suggesting the deadline had shifted from October to ‘early November’. Mr Raab insisted even if the two sides fail to reach a deal, Britain will carry on with no significant disruption.Yesterday’s three-hour meeting was the third time Mr Raab and Mr Barnier have met in little over a month. In contrast, it took the first six months of 2018 for Mr Barnier to meet former Brexit Secretary, David Davis, the same number of times. It reflects ministers’ hopes of stepping up the pace of negotiations in the hope of hammering out a deal in time for an EU summit in October. And Mr Raab revealed he would be visiting Brussels again next week.He said: ‘I agree with Michel that we need to keep, as we climb the mountain, our eyes on the summit and accentuate the positives. But we’ve got to close down those areas of disagreement.‘We’re going to be picking up the intensity of negotiations. The responsible thing for any government to do, and on the EU side, is to make sure we’re prepared for all eventualities.’ Mr Raab is expected to give more details in his speech tomorrow, with around 20 papers being published detailing Britain’s preparations for leaving the EU in the event of a no deal.The documents will cover such subjects as payments to farmers, state aid, nuclear research and the Erasmus education scheme.Hunt urges EU leaders to form a united front against Russian...Failure to strike Brexit deal could cause severe shortages...Share this articleAn impact paper for financial services – one of the most contentious areas – was also originally listed for publication tomorrow but could be delayed. One already leaked document suggests the UK plans to give 3.8 million EU citizens currently living in the UK the right to remain permanently in the event of no deal.The papers are understood to be relatively short, anywhere between two and five pages.Mr Barnier warned the EU would not be swayed by what he described as a ‘blame game’ in Britain over who would be responsible for a no deal Brexit.          Mr Raab said he knew \u0027how committed\u0027 Mr Barnier was to finding a way through the impasse at the press conferenceHe added that the EU did not want no deal because it would be the ‘most costly’ but that it also had to prepare for it. Brussels has long insisted a deal on the withdrawal agreement should be reached by October to give the EU Council and Parliament enough time to ratify it before Britain formally leaves at the end of March. When asked if he believed a deal could still be reached by October, Mr Barnier said it needed to be ‘well before the end of the year’ and no later than early November.However, he said disagreements remained over Theresa May’s Chequers white paper as it ‘contradicts’ the negotiating guidelines from member states. The Irish border issue remains a sticking point. When asked why the EU had not shifted on its red lines while Britain appeared to, he said: ‘How can you change principles on which the EU is based? The UK is leaving the EU, not the other way around.’Yesterday Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt still believed a deal would be reached saying: ‘As a country we have had bigger challenges than this and we will find a way whatever the outcome to survive and prosper.’  Mr Raab said he knew \u0027how committed\u0027 Mr Barnier was to finding a way through the impasseMr Barnier also appeared to play down the idea that the EU should make concessions, despite saying he would be \u0027pragmatic\u0027.\u0027How do you change principles on which the EU is based?\u0027 he said.\u0027The UK is leaving the EU, not the other way round. The EU is based on principles, on values, on laws.\u0027 Mr Barnier said an agreement had to come quickly, suggesting it could happen by the \u0027beginning of November but not much later than that\u0027. \u0027We have agreed that the EU and UK will negotiate continuously from now on, and Dominic and I will meet regularly to take stock and move the negotiations forward,\u0027 he told the press conference.           Mr Barnier has played down the idea that the EU should make concessions to Britain. Here the pair are pictured shaking hands at the European Commission in Brussels last month (July 2018).Mr Barnier added that the two sides are more \u0027advanced\u0027 in defining the common ground for foreign policy and security than the economic relationship. \u0027Our challenge for the coming weeks is to try and define an ambitious partnership between the UK and the EU - a partnership that has no precedent. \u0027This partnership has to respect the single market and the foundations of the European project, and if this is well understood we can conclude the negotiations successfully.\u0027 Mr Raab said he knew \u0027how committed\u0027 Mr Barnier was to finding a way through the impasse.\u0027We agreed that we need to step up the intensity of the negotiations as we come into the final phase and we have agreed to meet regularly and resolve at the political level those outstanding issues that remain under technical consideration, he said. He added: \u0027If we have that ambition ... I am confident we can reach the agreement in October.\u0027The scramble to break the deadlock comes as ministers escalate preparations for no deal.On Thursday, the Government will publish the first of a series of technical notices, designed to help people and businesses prepare for a no-deal scenario.Mr Raab will also give a speech outlining how the Government plans to mitigate the potential risks of leaving the EU without a deal and ensure continuity and stability.Speaking at the press conference, Mr Raab shrugged off \u0027hair raising scare stories\u0027 about the consequences of negotiations collapsing.  The issue of EU nationals\u0027 residency will not be among more than 80 \u0027no-deal\u0027 technical notices to be issued over the coming weeks. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/21/20/4F47C47C00000578-6083523-image-a-2_1534879534780.jpg","title":"Machete wielding man sprints Manchester city centre","story":"    An 18-year-old was arrested for running through Manchester city centre with a macheteIn June, business owners and residents in Chinatown said they were facing constant issues with drug dealing, violence and anti-social behaviour.There were 304 crimes recorded in the area in the first three months of 2018 - a 44 per cent increase on the same period in 2017, according to recent figures.Around half of those crimes were categorised as anti-social behaviour.

He went back to his cabin and left her. The next thing he knew he was woken by the crew to say they thought she was missing as they had found her belongings.\u0027By this point a search was being carried out by the crew and the ship doubled back and carried out at least four passes. The coastguard then took over, and the ship went on to Venice.Doubts have been cast on Miss Longstaff\u0027s claim that she fell from the liner.The captain of the ship said she was a \u0027jumper\u0027 while the director of a trade organisation representing over 50 cruise companies said it was unheard of for anyone acting \u0027 responsibly\u0027 falling off a ship.Other passengers on the week long cruise around the Greek islands claimed the couple had been arguing and drinking prior to Longstaff going over the side.After spending a night in hospital in the Croatian port of Pula she was discharged and driven to Venice at her pre booked hotel.Medical staff in Pula said Longstaff had mild hypothermia symptoms but was otherwise in good condition despite spending 10 hours in the water.Survival experts said the relatively warm temperature of the sea and lack of wind to churn up the waves helped in her survival.Miss Longstaff remained hidden away in her hotel room and told staff not to put any calls through.  Air stewardess almost drowned - because rescue plane couldn\u0027t see her frantic wavingThe British woman who spent ten hours in the sea after going overboard from a cruise ship was forced to watch a rescue plane circle above for up to two hours before being saved, it was revealed yesterday.The captain of the boat that rescued Kay Longstaff said she was probably not seen from the air because she was not in a life jacket and was only just above the water.Lovro Oreskovic, commander of the coastguard patrol boat Cavtat, also said it took his crew \u0027just five minutes\u0027 to find her after they arrived in the area where she was reported to have gone overboard from the Norwegian Star.He claimed her miraculous survival was a rebirth, adding: \u0027We wish her all the best in her new life.  Kay Longstaff who claimed she had fallen from the Norwegian Star off the coast of Croatia over the weekend, has now been released from hospital in Pula\u0027I say new because it\u0027s like she died and has been reborn.\u0027But he declined to reveal what the 46-year-old told him or his crew about how she ended up in the water as that was \u0027a matter under investigation\u0027.Miss Longstaff\u0027s father yesterday described her as a \u0027heroine\u0027 and said he was \u0027very proud\u0027 of her.Ron Longstaff, 76, a retired police superintendent, said that his eldest child\u0027s skill as an air hostess, as well as a high level of fitness from yoga helped save her.The widower, from Kenilworth, Warwickshire, said: \u0027She\u0027s a heroine for surviving ten hours in the sea – it\u0027s an amazing feat.\u0027I\u0027m sure she was expecting to die, but she kept alive by floating. She\u0027s a good swimmer, but she knew she had a better chance of surviving by floating.\u0027The father-of-two added that Miss Longstaff, an air hostess who left Virgin Atlantic to work for an independent company, had \u0027dealt with quite a lot of emergencies\u0027 during her career.He also denied accusations that she had deliberately gone overboard, saying he \u0027cannot imagine her jumping\u0027.          British woman Kay Longstaff pulled from the Adriatic Sea 10 hours after falling from a cruise ship is pictured smiling with her rescuers before being taken to hospitalMr Longstaff was upset that some passengers had complained that their holidays had been ruined because the ship was delayed during the search and rescue operation, adding: \u0027She must have been terrified. She would have been thinking she\u0027d die after ten hours in the ocean. The fact she survived – and not many people would – is a miracle.\u0027Describing the rescue yesterday, Lieutenant Oreskovic said: \u0027We received the call at sunrise and it took us three hours to get to the search area, but then there she was. We spotted her about 200m from our starboard side.\u0027We tried to throw her a buoy on a rope from 5m away so we could pull her in, but she was too exhausted to catch it. She just didn\u0027t have the strength.\u0027Instead, rescuer Marin Delic swam across to Miss Longstaff and helped her back to the Cavtat.Lieutenant Oreskovic said: \u0027She saw the Pilatus PC-9 spotter plane and waved at it. But they didn\u0027t see her. It\u0027s very hard to see people in the water without a life jacket.\u0027She was only wearing some kind of bra. She was about 20cm above the water because she didn\u0027t have a life jacket on.\u0027She thought the plane had noticed her, but then she saw it circling round over and over and she realised it hadn\u0027t – one to two hours before we found her.          Ms Longstaff posted Facebook pictures of herself during the cruise including when the vessel docked off the Greek island of Santorini (pictured) last week          Another of her holiday snaps posted on Facebook shows the Norwegian Star near shore during the Mediterranean cruise last week \u0027She was very happy, very relieved and very grateful when we found her. The first thing she said to us when she came on board was, \u0027You saved my life! You saved my life!\u0027.\u0027She was in shock and dehydrated. She was very red and her skin was wrinkled from being so long in the water. We gave her water and she was checked by our medical team. She was also hungry so we gave her some vegetable soup and a chocolate mousse. She also had an isotonic energy drink and some fresh orange juice.\u0027He said a crew member lent her a T-shirt and a pair of trousers so she had dry clothes to wear.She slept for about an hour on a sofa as the ship returned to shore.  By then, her shorts had dried and she changed back in to them.Last night, questions continued to be asked about exactly what had happened when Miss Longstaff, who lives on the Costa del Sol in Spain, tumbled from the cruise liner shortly before midnight on Saturday, off northern Croatia, around 60 miles south of Pula.She has been accused of causing huge disruption to passengers, and costing Norwegian Cruise Line hundreds of thousands of pounds for delays caused by the incident.Lawyer Jim Fisher, an expert in cruise ship accidents, said 80 per cent of incidents of people going overboard from cruise liners were linked to alcohol, while 5 per cent were trying to take their lives.Andy Harmer, director of the Cruise Lines International Association industry body, said: \u0027Cruise ships today are the safest that ever sailed thanks to the rules and technological innovations that govern their design. There are no known cases of someone acting responsibly who has accidentally fallen over the railing of a cruise ship.\u0027 He said safety regulations included uniform minimum railing and balcony heights of 1m, plus other structural barriers to prevent passengers falling off a ship.   "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/21/22/4F482C8B00000578-0-image-m-25_1534885358642.jpg","title":"Welsh actor Taron Egerton pictured playing Elton John new film singers journey stardom","story":"    Welsh actor Taron Egerton, 28, playing iconic rock star Elton John in the biopic \u0027Rocketman\u0027          Elton John on \u0027The Muppet Show\u0027.

Mr Raab insisted even if the two sides fail to reach a deal, Britain will carry on with no significant disruption.Yesterday’s three-hour meeting was the third time Mr Raab and Mr Barnier have met in little over a month. In contrast, it took the first six months of 2018 for Mr Barnier to meet former Brexit Secretary, David Davis, the same number of times. It reflects ministers’ hopes of stepping up the pace of negotiations in the hope of hammering out a deal in time for an EU summit in October. And Mr Raab revealed he would be visiting Brussels again next week.He said: ‘I agree with Michel that we need to keep, as we climb the mountain, our eyes on the summit and accentuate the positives. But we’ve got to close down those areas of disagreement.‘We’re going to be picking up the intensity of negotiations. The responsible thing for any government to do, and on the EU side, is to make sure we’re prepared for all eventualities.’ Mr Raab is expected to give more details in his speech tomorrow, with around 20 papers being published detailing Britain’s preparations for leaving the EU in the event of a no deal.The documents will cover such subjects as payments to farmers, state aid, nuclear research and the Erasmus education scheme.Hunt urges EU leaders to form a united front against Russian...Failure to strike Brexit deal could cause severe shortages...Share this articleAn impact paper for financial services – one of the most contentious areas – was also originally listed for publication tomorrow but could be delayed. One already leaked document suggests the UK plans to give 3.8 million EU citizens currently living in the UK the right to remain permanently in the event of no deal.The papers are understood to be relatively short, anywhere between two and five pages.Mr Barnier warned the EU would not be swayed by what he described as a ‘blame game’ in Britain over who would be responsible for a no deal Brexit.          Mr Raab said he knew \u0027how committed\u0027 Mr Barnier was to finding a way through the impasse at the press conferenceHe added that the EU did not want no deal because it would be the ‘most costly’ but that it also had to prepare for it. Brussels has long insisted a deal on the withdrawal agreement should be reached by October to give the EU Council and Parliament enough time to ratify it before Britain formally leaves at the end of March. When asked if he believed a deal could still be reached by October, Mr Barnier said it needed to be ‘well before the end of the year’ and no later than early November.However, he said disagreements remained over Theresa May’s Chequers white paper as it ‘contradicts’ the negotiating guidelines from member states. The Irish border issue remains a sticking point. When asked why the EU had not shifted on its red lines while Britain appeared to, he said: ‘How can you change principles on which the EU is based? The UK is leaving the EU, not the other way around.’Yesterday Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt still believed a deal would be reached saying: ‘As a country we have had bigger challenges than this and we will find a way whatever the outcome to survive and prosper.’  Mr Raab said he knew \u0027how committed\u0027 Mr Barnier was to finding a way through the impasseMr Barnier also appeared to play down the idea that the EU should make concessions, despite saying he would be \u0027pragmatic\u0027.\u0027How do you change principles on which the EU is based?\u0027 he said.\u0027The UK is leaving the EU, not the other way round. The EU is based on principles, on values, on laws.\u0027 Mr Barnier said an agreement had to come quickly, suggesting it could happen by the \u0027beginning of November but not much later than that\u0027. \u0027We have agreed that the EU and UK will negotiate continuously from now on, and Dominic and I will meet regularly to take stock and move the negotiations forward,\u0027 he told the press conference.           Mr Barnier has played down the idea that the EU should make concessions to Britain. Here the pair are pictured shaking hands at the European Commission in Brussels last month (July 2018).Mr Barnier added that the two sides are more \u0027advanced\u0027 in defining the common ground for foreign policy and security than the economic relationship. \u0027Our challenge for the coming weeks is to try and define an ambitious partnership between the UK and the EU - a partnership that has no precedent. \u0027This partnership has to respect the single market and the foundations of the European project, and if this is well understood we can conclude the negotiations successfully.\u0027 Mr Raab said he knew \u0027how committed\u0027 Mr Barnier was to finding a way through the impasse.\u0027We agreed that we need to step up the intensity of the negotiations as we come into the final phase and we have agreed to meet regularly and resolve at the political level those outstanding issues that remain under technical consideration, he said. He added: \u0027If we have that ambition ... I am confident we can reach the agreement in October.\u0027The scramble to break the deadlock comes as ministers escalate preparations for no deal.On Thursday, the Government will publish the first of a series of technical notices, designed to help people and businesses prepare for a no-deal scenario.Mr Raab will also give a speech outlining how the Government plans to mitigate the potential risks of leaving the EU without a deal and ensure continuity and stability.Speaking at the press conference, Mr Raab shrugged off \u0027hair raising scare stories\u0027 about the consequences of negotiations collapsing.  The issue of EU nationals\u0027 residency will not be among more than 80 \u0027no-deal\u0027 technical notices to be issued over the coming weeks. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/21/18/4F447AB400000578-6083525-image-m-20_1534871348352.jpg","title":"Dog begs change orders sausage Mexico","story":"    The clever stray pooch begs for spare change from people outside a hot dog stand by pawing at their legs in Tezoyuca, Mexico Cabron is a common fixture nearby the hot dog stand in Tezoyuca and as soon as customers arrive, begins to beg them for money to buy a hot dog, according to local media.  Vasquez posted the video to his Facebook which soon became a viral hit and amassed 14million views.He said: \u0027Today I was working in the area and I met him, for those who think that small animals can neither feel, nor think.\u0027  The dog named, Cabron, is a common fixture at the fast food shop, dropped the coin on the counter and patiently waited to be handed a sausage "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/21/19/4F47828900000578-0-image-m-25_1534877329456.jpg","title":"Grandfather 64 reveals German pointer fought dognappers","story":"Royal Navy shadows Russia\u0027s newest warship as the...Share this articleIt was at this point the second attacker ‘came out of the trees with the Irn-Bru bottle’.Michael, who has three children and four grandchildren, added: ‘He sprayed me but I turned away just in time.

Unlike those other staples of an imagined future, however, this architectural oddity actually existed. A colourful pod in the shape of an ellipse, the Futuro was a sci-fi vision of the future, offering us a living space light years away from what most of us were used to. Nicknamed the Flying Saucer and the UFO House, it was symbolic of the ambitious space-race era. But as the Futuro celebrates its 50th anniversary, the revolution it promised clearly never happened. Aficionados estimate that of the 100 or so made, only 68½ (more on the half later) remain.One belongs to Craig Barnes, an artist based in London, who saw a Futuro in a “dishevelled and tired” state while on holiday in Port Alfred, South Africa. He decided to mount a rescue mission. “I have family out there,” he says, “and I’d been seeing this Futuro since I was about three. I viewed it as a spaceship. I drove past in 2013 and workers were knocking down a garage next to it. I panicked and managed to trace the owner.”Barnes learned of plans to relocate the Futuro to the grounds of a guesthouse, where inflatable green “aliens” would be installed and dry ice pumped from underneath. “I thought it was ungracious to treat an old lady in such a fashion and, over five insane days, bought it, had it dismantled and arranged for it to be shipped to the UK.”The Futuro looked as if it came from outer space, but actually it was from outer Finland. It was designed by a Matti Suuronen, an architect and keen volleyball player who was part of Finland’s national league. “He had been commissioned by a childhood friend to design a cabin on a ski slope,” says his daughter Sari. “The family needed a place on the steep hill where they could stay for the weekend, warm up and have some meals.”The cabin housed eight people and was held aloft by steel legs. The curved shape meant snow couldn’t settle. It had fixed seats, a kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms and a central table. Cooking was done using a portable “fire box”. And, because it measured a mere eight metres across, the pod could be transported on a flat-bed lorry or hoisted into position by helicopter.Suuronen pioneered the use of reinforced plastic and manmade materials such as polyester resin, fibreglass and acrylic. Another of his creations was a petrol station in Lempäälä, south-west Finland, made principally from plastic. Motorists often took lengthy detours to visit it.Born in 1933, Suuronen claimed the Futuro was purely an application of mathematics, but many believe he was influenced – perhaps subliminally – by science fiction. Flying saucers had emerged in the late 1920s, brilliantly imagined and drawn in American pulp magazines such as Amazing Stories and Science Wonder Stories. By the 50s, they often featured in films, among them The Day the Earth Stood Still, Forbidden Planet and Earth vs the Flying Saucers.The first exemplar of space-age architecture is thought to be the House of the Future, installed at Disneyland, California, in 1957. Designers were asked to imagine how housing might look 30 years hence. The fibreglass structure was set on a pedestal and had four symmetrical wings. More than 20 million people visited during the 10 years it was standing. But the architect chiefly associated with atomic-age houses is John Lautner. His most famous work, the Chemosphere, was built in 1960, overlooking San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles. A one-storey octagon, it is perched on a nine-metre concrete pole and reached by funicular. Its current owner is Benedikt Taschen, founder of the eponymous German publishing house and, significantly, a comic-book fanatic.While Lautner and others indulged wealthy patrons and corporate sponsors, Suuronen had a more homespun, utilitarian vision for the Futuro. He based his company in Espoo, a city near Helsinki, most famous for being the home of the Finnish Museum of Horology – and for spawning the death metal band Children of Bodom, frequent toppers of the country’s album chart.Suuronen designed his own family’s home and lived there with his wife, Sirkku, a professional pianist, and their three children. His eye for detail was such that he could read technical plans upside-down. Even at their busiest, Suuronen did not employ more than a dozen people and each started work at 10am, thanks to the boss’s fondness for a lie-in.In 1968, the Futuro was displayed at the Finfocus export fair in London, positioned on the upper deck of a ferry moored on the Thames. More than 400 enquiries were logged and media interest was high. On 20 July 1969, the day Apollo 11 landed on the moon, the New York Times carried a piece with the headline: “Saucer-shaped house arrives on Earth.”A licence to manufacture the Futuro was granted to around 30 companies throughout the world. The sole UK recipient was Waterside Plastics, in the mill town of Todmorden, West Yorkshire. The company had evolved from Fielden Brothers, a major textile concern run to a benevolent ethos. Almost 2,000 people had once been employed in 11 of its mills. The commitment to the Futuro (and to similar projects such as “Sharky the unsinkable sloop”) was a gallant but doomed attempt to leave a legacy. The company folded in 1979.The surroundings in Todmorden – all narrow, sooty streets and factories chiselled into the steep Pennines – could not have been more incongruous. The town’s mayor, Donald Rigg, arranged for a prototype of the house (the only Futuro ever manufactured in the UK) to feature in the 75th anniversary of Todmorden’s borough charter, in 1971. That summer, it was mounted on land outside a medical centre and used as a ticket office for celebratory events. Hundreds turned out to see it paraded through the streets by lorry and then put in place by crane. It looked as if the locals had captured a spaceship.The first Futuro installed as a bona fide residence was at Lake Puula, near Espoo. Futura 001 was purchased as a summer home by Finnish comedy actor Matti Kuusla. Locals said it was out of place in a rural environment. This pattern was repeated elsewhere, especially in the US, where permission to erect them was often refused. Banks were reluctant to provide finance and then the 1973 oil crisis, which saw prices quadruple, effectively ended the Futuro experiment. Plastic had been viewed as an inexpensive building material but oil is required in its production, and costs for the house rose prohibitively. In a few short years, the Futuro had become a curiosity rather than a force for revolution.While many of the 100 or so Futuros made have been destroyed or vandalised, others have found new lives – as restaurants, children’s play rooms, targets for shooting practice and a dog kennel. One even ended up as a VIP room at 2001 Odyssey, a strip club in Tampa Bay, Florida. “Say ‘spaceship’ at the door for free entry,” reads its sign. Several are exhibited in museums and a building in Frankfurt has half a Futuro (it was sliced in two) bolted to its side.Suuronen spent his final years short of money. “He was too kind and blue-eyed to be a businessman,” says Sari. “He did not know how to take advantage of the fame of Futuro, to make money out of it. He had many health issues and didn’t have the energy to pursue more designing contracts. A recession in the 1990s slowed construction in Finland. He was also too slow to lay off his personnel and he used up my mother’s inheritance. The bank took their house and sold it at auction for very little money. So they lost everything.’’Suuronen died in 2013, aged 79. He had cancer, as well as heart and respiratory problems. “He was always very optimistic about his health,” says Sari. “He played volleyball up until his last operation. He never lost his vivid, creative mind and his lust for creating something more for the world.”Meanwhile, after years of hard work and at great expense, Barnes has renovated the Futuro he bought in South Africa. The spherical house was exhibited in London on the roof of Matt’s Gallery and installed at Central Saint Martins, then shipped to Le Havre, northern France, for the city’s summer festival this year. “The Futuro shouldn’t be viewed as a flawed and failed utopian ideal,” says Barnes. “It’s a wonderful space to bounce around ideas. Everything about it is a celebration of the imagination.”The patent for the Futuro, meanwhile, has remained with the Suuronen family. The house of the future may yet return."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3220d4fd71b80196aeeecf95890da419401f50ea/41_52_2845_1707/master/2845.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28ab4346096edc9ec233b0f23b40e487","title":"black britain in the 1970s autograph in pictures","story":"From the archive of arts agency Autograph, these photos depict the lives of black Britons, from sound systems to strident politics "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b69c051c35ea1348811fcf6c8bef6598233b2e6/2441_480_1877_1120/master/1877.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=743e4468a538d9f01d87f5a28ddb21ec","title":"silence of the girls pat barker book review iliad","story":"This brilliant retelling of Homer’s epic poem focuses on the cost of war to women through the story of Briseis, Achilles’ concubineIn The Iliad, a poem about the terrible destruction caused by male aggression, the bodies and pretty faces of women are the objects through which men struggle with each other for status. The women are not entirely silent, and goddesses always have plenty to say, but mortal women speak primarily to lament. They grieve for their dead sons, dead fathers, dead husbands and dead protectors for the city of Troy, soon to fall, and for their own freedom, taken by the victors of war. Andromache pleads with her Trojan husband Hector not to leave her and their infant son to go back to fight Achilles. She has already endured the sack of her home city by Achilles, and seen the slaughter of her father and seven brothers, and the enslavement of her mother. If Hector dies, their child will be hurled from the city walls, Troy will fall and Andromache will be made the concubine of the son of her husband’s killer. Hector knows this, but he insists that his own need to avoid social humiliation as a battle-shirker trumps it all: “I would be ashamed before the Trojan men and women,” he says. He hopes only to be dead before he has to hear her screams.Pat Barker’s brilliant new novelistic retelling of The Iliad puts the experience of women like Andromache at the heart of the story: the women who survive in slavery when men destroy their cities and kill their fathers, brothers and children. The central character is Briseis, the woman awarded to Achilles, the greatest Greek fighter, after his army sacks one of the towns\u0026nbspneighbouring Troy. Agamemnon, the most powerful, although not the bravest, of the Greek warriors – a character whose downright nastiness comes across beautifully in Barker’s telling – has lost\u0026nbsphis own most\u0026nbsprecent female acquisition and seizes Briseis from Achilles. Achilles’ vengeful rage against Agamemnon and his own comrades, and the\u0026nbspsubsequent vast death toll of the\u0026nbspGreeks and Trojans, is the central theme of The\u0026nbspIliad.Homer’s poem ends by foreshadowing the fall of Troy in the death of its greatest fighter, Hector. Barker’s novel begins with the fall of another town: Lyrnessus, Briseis’ home, destroyed by Achilles and his men. We then see that the fall of a city is the end of a story only for the male warriors: some leave triumphant and others lie there dead. For the women, it is the start of\u0026nbspnew horrors.Barker keeps the main bones of the Homeric poem in place, supplementing Homer at the end of the story with Euripides. His heartbreaking play The Trojan Women is, like Barker’s novel, a version of the story that shifts our attention from the angry, des-tructive, quick-footed, short-lived boys to the raped, enslaved, widowed women, who watch their city burn and, if they are lucky, get a moment to bury their slaughtered children and grandchildren before they are taken far away. One of Barker’s most tear-jerking sequences is lifted straight from Euripides: the teenage daughter of Priam and Hecuba is gagged and killed as a “sacrifice” on the dead Achilles’ tomb, and then Hecuba is presented with the tiny corpse of her dead grandson, a toddler with his skull cracked open. The girl’s gagged mouth and the child’s gaping brains conjure a gruesome twinned image for the silenced voices that should tell of the horror and pity suffered by the victims of war.For most of Barker’s novel, Briseis is the first-person narrator, but in the final part, the narrative is intercut with third-person chapters told from the point of view\u0026nbspof Achilles. We never get as close to Achilles as we do to Briseis, but he is a compelling figure in his fascinating combination of brutality and civility. Like Siegfried Sassoon in Barker’s 1991 novel Regeneration, this Achilles has the soul of a poet as well as of a killer and hunter: he is a man whose physical courage and compulsion to fight sit uneasily with his clear, articulate awareness of the futility of war.But Achilles, however fascinating he may be, is not at the centre of this story. The novel provides a moving, thought-provoking version of what is perhaps the most famous moment of The Iliad: when the old king Priam makes his way, alone and unarmed, through the enemy camp, to plead with Achilles to give back the mutilated body of his son, Hector. Barker twice quotes Priam’s Homeric words to Achilles: “I do what no man before me has ever done, I kiss the hands of the man who killed my son.” Barker lets us feel the\u0026nbsppathos and pity of this moment, as well as the pathos of all the many young men who die violent deaths far from home. We glimpse, too, Achilles’ alienation from his own “terrible, man-killing hands”, which have caused so many deaths. Briseis has a powerful riposte to Priam’s words, weighing this unique encounter between men against the myriad unremembered horrors suffered by women in war. “I\u0026nbspdo what countless women before me have been forced to do. I spread my legs for the man who killed my husband and my brothers.”Barker’s novel has a very clear feminist message about the struggle for women to extricate themselves from male-dominated narratives. In the hands of a lesser writer, it could have felt preachy. The attempt to provide Briseis with a happy ending is thin, and sometimes the female characters’ legitimate outrage seems a bit predictable, as when we hear Helen thinking: “I’m here. Me. A person, not just an object to be looked at and fought over.”The novel has some anachronisms, such as a “weekend market” (there were no weekends in antiquity), and a reference to “half a crown”, as if we were in the same period as Barker’s first world war novels. One wonders if any woman in archaic Greece, even a former queen, would have quite the self-assurance of Barker’s Briseis. But, of course, there is\u0026nbspno way to be sure: no words from women in this period survive but Barker is surely right to paint them as thoughtful, erse, rounded human beings, whose humanity hardly ever dawns on their captors, owners and husbands. This central historical insight feels entirely truthful.Barker has a quasi-Homeric gift for similes: “that shining moment, when the din of battle fades and your body’s a rod connecting earth and sky”, or Achilles’ friend Patroclus dying, “thrashing like a fish\u0026nbspin a pool that’s drying out”. There is a Homeric simplicity and drive in some of the sentences: “Blood, shit and brains – and there he is, the son of\u0026nbspPeleus, half beast, half god,\u0026nbspdriving on to glory.” She is Homeric, too, in her\u0026nbspattentiveness to what happens between people, and to the details of the physical world: the food, the\u0026nbspwine, the clothes, the noise and the feel of skin, blood, bones, crackling wounds and screams. Barker, like Homer, understands grief and loss, and sees how\u0026nbspalone people can be even\u0026nbspwhen they are crying together. Loneliness in community is one of\u0026nbspthe major themes of this book, as it is of The Iliad. The gods remain mostly off stage but they are present in the background, magically restoring the mutilated dead body of Hector. The sea\u0026nbspgoddess Thetis, Achilles’ mother, is a briny, frightening presence, as are the dark shore and\u0026nbspthe waves by which the whole horrible story takes place.This is an important, powerful, memorable book that invites us to look differently not only at The Iliad but at our own ways of telling stories about the past and the present, and at how anger and hatred play out in our societies. “The defeated go down in history and disappear, and their stories die with them.” Barker’s novel is an invitation to tell those forgotten stories, and to listen for voices silenced by history and power.• Emily Wilson translated The Odyssey (Norton) and The\u0026nbspTrojan Women and other plays by Euripides for The Greek Plays (Modern Library).

Outfox the Market, Pure Planet, Bulb, Yorkshire Energy and People’s Energy all offer tariffs at least £267 less and in one case £354 less than the average default tariff offered by the big six, uSwitch found. A year ago just two of the 10 cheapest were green.Larger suppliers, which had retreated from green energy tariffs in recent years, have also returned to renewables. Both E.ON and npower now offer fixed green tariffs, though they cost hundreds of pounds more than those offered by smaller rivals. There are now 57 green tariffs, up from 36 a year ago.uSwitch said the emergence of cheap green deals was driven mostly by smaller suppliers trying to differentiate themselves, and showed they are “no longer an expensive luxury for those who can afford to pay for their principles”.But the rise of cheap green tariffs has raised concerns in the industry over just how green they are.The debate hinges on how energy suppliers buy their renewable electricity. Recent entrants have taken a cheaper approach than older green suppliers such as Good Energy, which argues some new suppliers are not encouraging additional windfarms and solar parks.Johnny Gowdy, a director at Regen, an independent not-for-profit that advises on sustainable energy, called it a “looming greenwash problem” that could undo work done to persuade consumers to switch to green energy.However, Steven Day, the co-founder of Pure Planet, which launched in 2017, said: “All green energy is certified by the regulator to exactly the same degree and that’s all that matters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfc8b2d5c0c8e1d3b97efd566209389a8f84d63f/419_0_4167_2500/master/4167.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7b3e836ab6276fe515553841cd9a411","title":"ceci nest pas une rue where the streets have new names brussels","story":"Artist René Magritte, frites and famous women have inspired entries to a competition to rename streets and squares in BrusselsIn Brussels, the home of surrealism, city officials have given their blessing to rename a street in homage to one of René Magritte’s best-known paintings.Ceci n’est pas une rue (This is not a street) is inspired by The Treachery of Images, painted in 1929 by the Belgian artist, who lived in Brussels for decades.It was one of nearly 1,400 suggestions made by the public in response to an initiative to generate interest in a regeneration project in a former industrial district in the north of the city.Eschewing famous Belgians of the past, many of the winning names are whimsical or poetic, or evoke the quirkiness of the Belgian capital. In a rejuvenated park, pedestrians and cyclists will be able to follow Better World Path, or Happiness Way. Visitors may end up on Place des choukes – chouke, “little cabbage”, translates as a warmer version of “darling”. A final stop might be Dreams Drive, euphonious Drèves des rêves or Dromendreef. As Brussels is a bilingual city, all street names are in French and Dutch.Belgian citizens were given the chance to name 28 streets, alleys, squares and walkways that make up the former industrial zone of Tour \u0026amp Taxis. The final names were chosen by a jury comprising city officials, local heritage experts and property developer Extensa, which bought the vast derelict site from the Brussels capital region in 1999.Once a railway station and inland port, the district was a maze of warehouses, customs buildings and post and telegraph offices. By the early 1990s the area had fallen on hard times: lorry transport had rendered rail freight lines obsolete, while the introduction of a European customs union and harmonisation of standards drastically reduced incoming goods.Kris Verhellen, chief executive of Extensa, said the company would never have dared to make some of the suggestions. “For me, it was quite a surprise that there were quite a lot of soft values in the street names that were proposed.“I thought it was very moving because we are so used to being so negative about this city.”Two Belgian women will also be honoured as a result of the public vote. The pioneering filmmaker Chantal Akerman, who died in 2015, will have a street named after her. And Belgium’s first female doctor, Isala Van Diest, who battled years of sexism from the late 19th century Belgian medical establishment, will also lend her name to a street.Verhellen said one of the choices “didn’t make us popular with the collective of women that is campaigning for more women’s names”, which was also represented on the selection jury.Place des grands hommes, he said, was correctly translated in a gender neutral way as “great people” rather than “great men”. He said the name of this square was proposed by a woman, who had explained, “We are all des grand hommes”.While most of the streets will be private, the larger ones leading to the site will be public. But tourists looking for a selfie will have to wait a few years, as most will not be redeveloped until 2020.Celebrities with little connection to Belgium were also rejected. But proposals based on Belgian specialities proved a winning choice: old shuntings and sideways in the railway station will be renamed after Belgian foods, such as kriek (cherry beer), enes, pralines and frites.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adb65bfb73578400d5c4f4ae73fb7a334f733f9d/0_4_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2838dfff11938d2fe6b51bd3fa5e8ba7","title":"measles rise europe populism andrew wakefield","story":"Measles is killing children – and adults – in Europe. There were 37 deaths in the first six months of this year, when there were 38 in the whole of the previous year. Between January and June, 41,000 people in the region caught the disease, which is one of the most infectious on the planet. That’s nearly double the number of cases in 2017.What is going on? Significant numbers of people are choosing not to have their children vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, against measles, mumps and rubella. The reasons they are making that choice and the implications of it are very concerning.It would be easy to blame it on one man. In 1998, Andrew Wakefield, then a gastroenterologist at the Royal Free hospital in London, published a paper in the Lancet that linked MMR to gut problems in children who had autism. The paper featured the cases of eight children. It might have been no big deal, except that, at a press conference, Wakefield advised against the triple MMR vaccine. The press ran lurid stories featuring children whose autism became evident at around the time they had their MMR jab and sent shivers through the hearts of many parents.Donald Trump himself has been numbered among the vaccine sceptics, telling a story about a two-year-old who “got” autism a week after she had the MMR. Wakefield appeared at one of his inauguration balls. There was talk of Trump setting up a committee to review the “link” to autism under vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr, although that didn’t happen.In France, Marine Le Pen, who leads the National Rally (formerly Front National) party, has championed the right of the people to say no in the face of a move by the government to make 11 vaccines mandatory for children – as is the case for diphtheria, tetanus and polio currently. The plan has emerged because of increasing vaccine hesitancy and a low MMR immunisation rate.Italy’s attempt to boost vaccination for children has run into major political problems. Last July health minister Beatrice Lorenzin made 10 vaccines mandatory for children enrolling in state-run schools, following concerns about measles outbreaks, with nearly 5,000 cases recorded last year (a rate second only to Romania in Europe). But the rise of the Five Star Movement appears to have put paid to that. The new health minister, Giulia Grillo, has now said parents will not be required to present schools with a vaccination certificate.The founder of Five Star, Beppe Grillo (no relation), is a vaccine sceptic. Vaccines can be as dangerous as the diseases they protect against, he once asserted. In 2015 the party proposed changing the law on vaccination, citing “the link between vaccinations and specific illnesses such as leukaemia, poisoning, inflammation, immunodepression, inheritable genetic mutations, cancer, autism and allergies”. Scientific misunderstandings are common among the anti-vaccine movements, along with a failure to properly weigh experimental results. Not all scientific studies are equal. Vaccine denialists tend to be selective in their approach to the evidence.Vaccine hesitancy does not map neatly on to party affiliation. Alongside the Trump-following populists and the rightwing anti-establishment inidualists are the left-leaning Mother Earth-lovers. These are people who worry about injecting their children with chemical compounds in the same way that they worry about pesticides in their food.Common to both groups is suspicion of big pharma. Anti-vaccine rhetoric cites pharmaceutical company scandals, of which there have been many. Multinational companies are only interested in profits and not to be trusted with children’s bodies, the doubters argue. These doubts spread globally online. You don’t see articles in newspapers arguing that vaccination causes autism any more, but that doesn’t matter in an era of social media. Mainstream scientists who want to demolish the conspiracy theories and bad science and explain how the evidence stacks up in favour of vaccinesare talking into a vacuum.Measles is a serious disease. Your healthy daughter may not die from it, but the fragile child down the road or the older man whose immune system is compromised will struggle to survive an infection. Vaccination used to be for the good of the community. We were all part of a social compact. We were vaccinated and allowed our precious children to have jabs in order to deprive these diseases of a home in our midst. But this is another era, in which the inidual is king, mistrust of authority is rife and vaccine-preventable diseases may well be making a major comeback.• Sarah Boseley is the ’s health editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/264b1cb778ac36db8246a6d36c8d7c88a40edc27/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf92bd9b7ca61be86463f577394b724a","title":"project britain debate oxford cambridge expressway","story":"Decisions about the Oxford-Cambridge expressway, and the vast conurbation it will create, are made behind closed doorsWhere democracy counts most, it is nowhere to be seen. The decisions that shape the life of a nation are taken behind our backs. With occasional exceptions, public choice is reserved for trivia. The most consequential choices, as they are the longest lasting, arguably involve\u0026nbspmajor\u0026nbspinfrastructure. The number of disasters in\u0026nbspthis field is remarkable. A classic paper by the economic geographer Bent Flyvbjerg, Survival of the Unfittest, explains that there is an innate tendency on the part of policymakers to choose the worst possible projects, as a result of the lock-in of fixed ideas at an early stage. This is caused, his evidence shows, not by accidental error or even delusional optimism, but by “strategic misrepresentation”. Advisers become advocates, and advocates become hucksters boosting their favoured projects.The schemes that look best on paper, and therefore are most likely to be adopted, are those that have been scrutinised the least. Democratic debate would reveal their flaws. This is why planners who wish to leave their mark treat it as a threat. To the megalomaniacs who draw lines on maps, public opinion is like landscape features: it must be cleared out of the way.A striking example is the government’s plan for an Oxford-to-Cambridge expressway. A decision to which we have not been party, which will irrevocably change the region it affects, is imminent. The new road, says the plan, will support the construction of a million homes.To give you some sense of the scale of this scheme, consider that Oxfordshire will have to provide 300,000 of them. It currently contains 280,000 homes. In 30 years, if this scheme goes ahead, the county must build as many new houses, and the infrastructure, public services and businesses required to support them, as have been built in the past 1,000. A million new homes amounts, in effect, to an Oxford-Cambridge conurbation.But none of this is up for debate. By the time we are asked for our opinion, there will be little left to discuss but the colour of the road signs. The questions that count, such as whether the new infrastructure should be built, or even where it should be built, will have been made without us.The justification for this scheme is not transport or housing as an end in itself. Its objective, according to the National Infrastructure Commission, is to enable the region “to maximise its economic potential”. Without this scheme, the commission insists, Oxford and Cambridge and the region between them “will be left behind, damaging the UK’s global competitiveness”.This reasoning, you might hope, would prompt some major questions. Is continued growth, in one of the wealthiest regions of the world, desirable? If it is desirable, does it outweigh the acceleration of climate breakdown the scheme will cause? When air pollution\u0026nbspalready exceeds legal limits, are new roads and their associated infrastructure either appropriate or safe? And are we really engaged in a race with other nations, in which being “left behind” is something to be\u0026nbspfeared?But these questions are not just closed to debate. They are not even recognised as questions. The megalomaniacs with their pencils, the rulers with their rulers, assume that their unexamined premises are shared by everyone.All the tendencies Flyvbjerg warned against are evident. Instead of asking “Do we need this scheme?”, the government agency Highways England, which is supposed to offer objective advice, opens its webpage with the heading “Why we need this scheme”. It claims, against the evidence, that the expressway will enhance the “attractiveness of the region” and “provide a healthy, natural environment, reducing congestion”. It is the kind of propaganda you would expect in a totalitarian state.The National Infrastructure Commission, which also advises the government, ignores some issues altogether, such as how water for another million homes will be provided in a region where demand already exceeds supply. It makes glancing reference to another massive problem: the extra traffic the new road links will generate will exacerbate congestion on existing roads. Its answer? Expand them as well.A recent study by the Campaign to Protect Rural England shows that, far from relieving congestion, new\u0026nbsproad schemes create new traffic – a tendency first noted in 1925 and ignored by transport planners ever since. But the treadmill must keep turning. The bypasses must be bypassed with new bypasses, new jobs must be created to match the new housing, and new\u0026nbsphousing must be built to match the new jobs. Growth must continue, until it destroys everything it claims to enhance.The government says it will announce which of three possible corridors for the expressway it will choose by the end of this summer. The choice will be made by the transport secretary alone, after which public consultation will commence. But once the corridor has been chosen, only the trivial issues remain.As the infrastructure commission’s report makes clear, there is really only one option for the route the new road can take. It might be possible for objectors to argue that the course of the road should be shifted by 100 metres here or there, but all the significant questions will be beyond the scope of the inquiry.By imposing this decision, the government ignores its legal obligations. It has failed to conduct a strategic environmental assessment before the corridor decision is made, as the law insists.

And it all depends on how it turns out. It would be foolish of me to give any of it away.”A script for Bond 25 had originally been completed by franchise veterans Neal Purvis and Robert Wade but it was reportedly put aside after Boyle and his Trainspotting co-writer came onboard. In July, a leaked call sheet suggested that the story would include a “charismatic, powerful, innovative, cosmopolitan, bright, cold and vindictive” Russian villain. It’s unclear what script will now be used.While Spectre received mixed reviews, it was a global hit, making $880m worldwide, although it fell short of Skyfall’s franchise-best $1.1bn haul. The next chapter, set to be released in 2019, was also due to be Daniel Craig’s last outing as the secret agent. “I just want to go out on a high note, and I can’t wait,” Craig said to Stephen Colbert in 2017.Craig had previously said he would “slash his wrists” rather than play the role again but has since explained himself. “Look, there’s no point in making excuses about it, but it was two days after I’d finished shooting the last movie,” he said. “I went straight into an interview and someone said would you do another one and I went ‘No!’”Boyle had previously worked with Craig in the opening to the 2012 Olympics, including 007 in a brief cameo alongside the Queen.Recent weeks have seen increased buzz around Idris Elba, long touted as a contender for Bond’s next iteration, after rumors that longtime Bond producer Barbara Broccoli wanted to bring some ersity to the role.“I keep saying if it were to happen it would be the will of a nation because there haven’t been any talks between me and the studio about any of that,” Elba said in 2016. “Running around in cars and ladies and martinis, who wants to do that? Sounds terrible.”Boyle’s most recent credit was Trust, a miniseries based around the infamous Getty kidnapping, following on from his long-awaited sequel to Trainspotting. He also recently wrapped a new musical comedy written by Richard Curtis set in a world where only one person can remember music by the Beatles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/149733d35d4e43cbf8d3b02cc74afb8091d9f649/0_240_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae21f8f7e12578c695f0594ea382b39d","title":"harvey weinstein sued by actor emma loman over alleged at cannes","story":"German actor alleges producer made clear he could ruin her career if she reported 2006 incidentGerman actor Emma Loman has filed a lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein, alleging the disgraced movie mogul raped her in 2006 at the Cannes film festival.In a complaint filed on Monday in Los Angeles, Loman said that she met Weinstein in 2004 at the Venice film festival and he later invited her to Cannes as his guest to discuss her career.Loman said she was initially hesitant to accept the invitation but Weinstein was persistent, with his assistant calling her up to 30 times a day. Loman said she finally relented and found Weinstein to be very professional during several meetings. The lawsuit says that changed, however, after he lured her to his hotel suite, presumably to discuss possible acting roles in some of his films. “Upon arriving at Weinstein’s suite ... Weinstein quickly dropped his professional demeanor. He instead overpowered Loman and raped her,” the lawsuit says. It adds that the 66-year-old former Hollywood producer subsequently made it clear to Loman that he could ruin her career if she came forward.“Fearful both that no one would believe her and the potential retaliation from such a powerful figure, Loman stayed silent,” the lawsuit says. “It was only upon the late 2017 revelation of the scope of Weinstein’s wrongful actions ... that Loman felt safe coming forward to seek redress for Weinstein’s rape of her.”Loman is suing Weinstein for assault, violation of human trafficking laws, battery and false imprisonment.Weinstein has been accused by dozens of women of numerous incidents of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to rape. He is out on bail and has pleaded not guilty in New York to six counts allegedly committed against three women in 2004, 2006 and 2013. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for 20 September.The allegations against Weinstein spurred the MeToo movement that saw women worldwide speak up against sexual harassment and assault.Weinstein’s agent did not immediately respond to requests for comment in relation to Loman’s lawsuit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc3bba116d8684a79c3ca54361a6c57cfd7624c8/0_99_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=322368cdd4a5eab380654b138fcaa810","title":"from pasta to stir fry foods children should learn to cook in school","story":"Prue Leith is right: children should learn to cook. Here are nine simple dishes they should be able to makePrue Leith has talked about the importance of teaching children to cook at school and for packed lunches to be banned. “The most important thing is to teach children to cook at schools,” she says. “And not only to cook but to understand about where their food comes from.”We’re a long way from programmes like Chefs in Schools, a British chef-led scheme to feed nutritious fresh food cooked from scratch for 72p per child per meal, or Alice Waters’ Edible Schoolyard in the USA, for whom “gardens and kitchens are interactive classroom”, making waves beyond the liberal enclaves of their respective countries.But if in a magical unicornville where Bambi’s mum didn’t die, where every child’s lunchbox was a festival of superfoods, and where home economics classes were made a priority, what crucial culinary skills would we bestow on our children? Some thoughts below emphasis on laying foundations, lack of faff, accessible ingredients, and making veg so delicious that Monster Munch become the edible equivalent of Mordred: a traitor of legend, who no one believes in any more.Cooking a pot of pasta is, as we know, easy, as long as you do so in plenty of water that is, as Anna Del Conte would say, “as salty as the Mediterranean”, to season it as it boils. No one doesn’t like a natty sauce that takes moments to throw together, least of all starving kids, so I refer you to Del Conte’s Marmite pasta – in which a slab of butter, a spoonful of Marmite, a splash of pasta cooking water, black pepper and parmesan are tossed with spaghetti – a storecupboard winner and meal of dreams. From here move on to tomato sauce, arrabiata, carbonara and beyond, for which our very own Rachel Roddy is everyone’s friend.Salad can mean anything, and is surely to the children’s table what Clueless’s Tai was to the classroom: in need of a makeover. It’s fresh and nutritious but there’s invariably one thing in any salad that a kid won’t eat. The solution? Have them make their own. A chopped salad offers the perfect playground, a way to experiment with different ingredients and combinations of them … Dress with something salty, piquant and acidic, like a basic vinaigrette, combining extra virgin olive oil, wine vinegar, dijon mustard, honey, salt and pepper.Learn how to make the base for a soup and you can make a meal at any time of year, which can be frozen easily and makes for excellent batch cooking – food for now and for later for those who enjoy cooking as much as they enjoy not-cooking. I like Oliver Rowe’s soup base recipe, given here with a watercress variation for spring and autumn, but doable with all manner of other vegetables at other times of year. A soup base like this encourages trial and error on the part of the cook – how much garlic do you like? Are fennel seeds your thing, or would some other aromatic taste better to you? It is just the kind of recipe with which I would want to furnish amateur cooks, the ingredients and quantities suggestions rather than dogmas.A traybake is a secret weapon for getting kids to eat more vegetables, imbuing them as it does with a variety of ingredients, textures and flavours. It’s also a cinch for them to make themselves, making for a complete meal with handsome (lunchbox-worthy) leftovers. Toss largely diced root vegetables – sweet potatoes, celeriac, turnip, carrot, parsnip, onions – with a punnet of cherry tomatoes, 3 grated cloves of garlic, the zest of a lemon, a teaspoon of bashed coriander seeds, a large glug of olive oil and a tablespoon of wine vinegar. Roast at 190C for 40 minutes and serve with pesto and some feta cheese.A good stew recipe is simple and endlessly adaptable, as Anna Jones shows with her six-ingredient stew and five ways to eat it. Yet another example of a loose and versatile recipe to act as a testing ground for kids to learn about their likes, dislikes and balancing flavours.It was study leave of May 2002 when I was switched onto stir-fry not bags of saggy beansprouts and tide-marked cabbage, but a proper homemade number, courtesy of Nigella’s How To Eat. This remains my favourite of her books, not least because, as well as being full of useful, easy things, it is as much loaded with briefly-noted ideas, paragraphs of culinary guidance, as it is recipes. Cut a few carrots and a few courgettes into batons and fry them in a splash of flavourless oil for a couple of minutes before adding two grated garlic cloves and some grated ginger, then a splash of water, until the vegetables are golden, aromatic and soft but still with a hint of crunch. (I did well in my exams and I still thank Nigella).Not as easy as it looks, but a useful kitchen friend when the cupboards are nearly bare. Unlike most of the recipes mentioned to this point, omelette is also a lesson in grasping a technique – if a simple one – and a good entry point to understanding the nuances of heat and timing. Try Felicity Cloake’s perfect recipe.Jay Rayner wrote that he would be sending his son off to university with a copy of Simon Hopkinson’s Roast Chicken \u0026amp Other Stories – a bible for beginner and budding cooks alike. His roast chicken is all about butter (don’t even think about oil), and he encourages the cook to surround their bird with vegetables to roast in its buttery juices. In the spirit of food being a ticket to bringing people together, I like the idea of equipping kids with the wherewithal to cook an impressive, fuss-free one-pot meal for their family and friends.They say breakfast is the most important of the day – but it’s also the first hurdle of a day’s eating at which people fall. Not least kids, lured by the sugary temptations of cereals, chocolate spreads, pop tarts … After soaking the oats in apple juice overnight, Claire Thomson’s bircher muesli recipe is ready immediately the following morning, and crams a few essential food groups – fruit, yoghurt and fibre galore – into one naturally sweet bowlful before you’ve even left for school. And you can make enough for a few days of breakfasts for a couple of quid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba755887134f357fb8e1b112936db4d00be73241/0_133_2264_1358/master/2264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b49735ea8ee4da3b79205f5beaf83c12","title":"qpr bristol city championship match report","story":"“Shambles.” That’s the word QPR fans Simon, 58, and Reg, 70, quickly settle on when asked to describe the current state of their club. It is exactly the same word that springs from the mouth of 18-year-old Matthew, another supporter awaiting this fixture: a must-win game for the Hoops just four games into a fledgling Championship season.It is a fair assumption this match will have done nothing to change their minds. QPR remain bottom of the championship after unravelling in the face of a persistent Bristol City. Matty Taylor’s ruthless opener was followed by a second-half double for Andreas Weimann, with both of the Austrian’s goals made far too easy for him by a shambolic home defence. There’s that word again.Sometimes the mood can be unfairly volatile in football but QPR’s recent trauma has been worse than most. The club have had four defeats in their first four matches, the third a 7-1 walloping at West Brom for which Steve McClaren felt necessary to apologise in his programme notes.This performance was not much better, but looming over the club are more existential concerns too. This summer the club accepted a £17m fine from the EFL over FFP irregularities and were put under a transfer embargo. That takes effect from January. In this window QPR have not spent a penny in transfer fees.For Simon and Reg, the trouble lies at the top and a lack of accountability from the director of football, Les Ferdinand, and the chief executive, Lee Hoos. For Matthew, the immediate problem lies with McClaren. All three question the wisdom of replacing the previous manager, Ian Holloway, after he kept the Rs clear of the drop zone last season.Sporting that familiar half-dazed expression, the beleaguered McClaren used his post-match remarks to reinforce the need for signings – whether on a free transfer or on loan – before the window shuts for EFL clubs at the end of this month.“The next 10 days are big‚“ he said. “We have talent out there, we have potential, but right now we’re suffering. I believe, if we get the right players in, we’ll be ok.”Bristol City have not enjoyed a great start to the season themselves and were yet to win in the league before this fixture. They took the lead in a first half of few chances after the former Bristol Rovers front man Taylor cut inside from the right, leaving full-back Jake Bidwell on his posterior, and fired low past Matt Ingram into the far corner.The visitors did not take long to double their advantage. Five minutes into the second half, Swedish winger Niclas Eliasson was found in space on the left of the QPR box. His cross was quick, accurate and found Weimann in lots of room. The former Derby forward had time to size up the situation, fling his head at the ball and place it beyond Ingram’s right hand.It was at this point that the away fans began to sing at McClaren. Beneath them, in the School End, stood an empty tier of seats. Parts of the rest of the ground were sparsely attended too, a reminder that the problems QPR face have not sprung up overnight. Hoos said recently that the club would have to leave Loftus Road, their home since 1917, as a ground with a capacity of 18,439 could not “create a sustainable business”. The attendance for this match was 11,739.As normal time came to an end Weimann tapped home a third after a bout of chaotic defending. “Why the hell are you still here?” sang the away end at those few home fans still remaining. “Where’s the money gone?” was another one. QPR’s settlement with the EFL was a reckoning after the club broke fair play rules on their way to promotion to the Premier League in 2012. Those days seem a long way away now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1db7b5b7bb5041db989733372a1c9b391a87b604/0_134_3488_2094/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25ce17e837f8936b1e2b4ca8c07c7857","title":"swansea leeds united championship match report","story":"This was not the suffocating performance or the kind of masterpiece Leeds supporters have already come to expect under Marcelo Bielsa but his remarkable revolution lives on after Pablo Hernández rescued a draw at his former parish to move top of the Championship.They twice allowed Oli McBurnie, the striker released by Leeds as a boy, to fire Swansea in front but Kemar Roofe’s fourth goal of the season plus Hernández’s late equaliser prevented the Bielsa bubble from bursting.This proved thoroughly entertaining fare, with both teams remaining unbeaten after Leeds rallied at the end of a seesawing second half, recovering from a sloppy start.Bielsa challenged his players to continue in the same high-octane, swaggering style that had served them so well but things did not go entirely to plan here. As Bielsa said, it was a Leeds performance with defects. After losing his captain, Liam Cooper, to a muscle injury at the end of the warm-up, Bielsa promoted the 18-year-old Jamie Shackleton into the starting lineup for first start in an unorthodox right-back role. Things got worse before they got better. After 27 minutes, Bielsa ruthlessly hooked Kalvin Phillips, booked, given the runaround by Bersant Celina and at fault for Swansea’s slick opener. The pace of Celina and Barrie McKay had fuelled the attack after Leroy Fer seized the ball on the edge of Swansea’s penalty area. McKay faced up Gaetano Berardi and played in McBurnie, who latched on to the ball and swiftly prodded home.“We didn’t defend well but there are justifications for that, because very soon, of the five players who build our defensive structure, we lost three of them and this was an obstacle,” Bielsa said, speaking through his translator. “The development of the game after Phillips got booked did not offer the defensive security that we needed to prevent Phillips from being booked again. In order to attack, you have to defend well.”On the touchline, Graham Potter applauded what he was seeing, Bielsa not so much. “We had a good intensity to our play,” the Swansea head coach said. “We had a good idea of what we wanted to do and we also had courage as well. Overall, really proud of the players and happy we’ve taken a step forward.”Swansea not only caged Leeds but excelled themselves, with Joe Rodon, the 20-year-old defender, going close to doubling the lead, nodding his downward header on to the roof of the net.Just before the break, Lewis Baker, Phillips’s replacement, sprayed the ball wide to Shackleton and after driving into the box the teenager switched on the afterburners, accelerating beyond Martin Olsson before laying the ball on for Roofe to score from close range.Bielsa introduced Jack Harrison, the Manchester City loanee, at half-time to inject some much-needed energy down the left flank. But Harrison found himself back-pedalling rather than pressing forward, immediately forced to repel Kyle Naughton before Olsson, having sped past Hernández towards the corner flag, teed up McBurnie, who evaded Berardi before calmly glancing a free header into the corner of Bailey Peacock-Farrell’s goal.What preceded Swansea’s second was a worrying sight: the defender Mike van der Hoorn waltzing through the spine of the Leeds midfield, dragging his Swansea team-mates with him.Leeds were straight back to square one, Bielsa crouched on the edge of his technical area, frantically trying to pull his team back into shape. A studious thinker, he is hardly one to roll the dice but his final change arrived just after hour mark, with Patrick Bamford replacing Roofe.Peacock-Farrell kept Leeds in the game with a fingertip save to deny McBurnie a hat-trick, while Fer could have rounded things off but got himself tangled.Leeds continued to probe as Swansea panicked, retreating deeper and deeper. When Bamford fooled Van der Hoorn on the touchline, the striker advanced before laying the ball on for Hernández to stroke home and send Leeds top.“We could have won this game, we could have lost it too,” Bielsa said. “We have played just a small part of the competition. I know it’s an important position to be in the table but it doesn’t mean a lot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/339b5841c918b829b1fec0f03d20235741f8cd65/42_340_1950_1170/master/1950.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b64c8b0aeb46c54be1fae67ef2d79667","title":"alleged massacre of amazon tribespeople javari valley brazil","story":"A paddle and bad recording of a bar-room conversation were all investigators had to go on when claims surfaced of killings deep in Brazil’s Javari Valley last yearWhen not selling breakfasts in this sleepy town on the western reaches of the Amazon, Algenor Costa fishes and hunts along the Jandiatuba River, as he has done for decades. Heading days upriver, he has often headed into the Javari Valley, a vast indigenous reserve where such activities are forbidden.“That’s the town larder,” he says. “Everybody enters there to fish and hunt.”Until last year, Costa, 53, sold his catch and prey to the crews of illegal gold dredgers – known as garimpeiros – who used this town as a support base before heading deep into the reserve, sucking up gold from the Jandiatuba River and pumping poisonous mercury into its muddy waters.Last year, however, Costa was at the centre of an inquiry into the alleged massacre of up to 10 tribespeople from an uncontacted group in the reserve. The case made headlines around the world, and forced the Brazilian government – who had already been alerted about the garimpeiros’ mining activities – into action. In late August, a pre-planned army operation destroyed four dredgers and seized another near the town. In November, Funai staff joined a second army operation that blew up ten more mining barges and headed into the reserve to look for evidence that a massacre had occurred.But they were unable to find anything conclusive. Instead, while prosecutors are still to close their investigation, the case has exposed the vulnerability of isolated groups in the Javari Valley, the prejudice indigenous people face in communities around them, and the difficulties of such investigations in areas of inaccessible wilderness.Locals said it was the third time the garimpeiros had set up in São Paulo de Olivença. Although many were out-of-towners, some locals, including Costa, delivered supplies to them. The garimpeiros barges’ were located days by boat from the town, deep inside the reserve.Costa and two other men, Manoel Castro and Roque Alves Rocha, were named in an anonymous denunciation received last August by Funai, Brazil’s indigenous agency, which included a badly recorded conversation and a photo of Costa with a paddle. The tip-off said the men had boasted of killing up to 10 indigenous people and had stolen the paddle and other artefacts. Other evidence led credibility to the denunciation. A flight over the area found some maloca longhouses had been burnt – common practice after a death in local tribes.Prosecutors in Tabatinga – a city six hours away by boat – opened an investigation and requested arrest warrants for the three men. A judge turned these down and authorised searches of their properties instead. Interviewed by TV Globo’s national news programme Jornal Nacional, the three men denied the accusations that they had been responsible for a massacre. “It is something I never did,” said Rocha. Castro said he had not seen the indigenous people, but that he and Costa had found two paddles in a canoe and taken one. Costa refused to say any more to the channel.But in an interview with the , Costa refuted being on the recording and said that he and Manoel Bida had found the paddle two years earlier in a canoe at a place called Três Bocas, deep inside the reserve, near footprints an isolated group had left crossing a river.“We didn’t see them, just their traces. It’s common there,” he says. Costa alleges that the supposed massacre had been devised by those who want to force the authorities to act over gold dredging, but doesn’t specify who this might be.He says it would be impossible to kill so many light-footed indigenous people and survive. He also alleges, despite having no evidence, that the isolated tribe practises cannibalism.“If they kill us, they eat us,” he says.Indigenous people around São Paulo de Olivença routinely face discrimination, but prejudice against them has increased since the denunciation, for which they were unjustly blamed, says one local leader, talking anonymously after receiving threats. Speaking to the , some local people say they feel indigenous people receive too much money in government benefits and believe the reserve is too big for the indigenous population that live there. Funai staff were threatened when they reached the town in November 2017 for a joint operation with army and environment agency officials, a federal prosecutor says. Three months had passed since the original tip-off – a delay criticised by Sydney Possuelo, a former Funai president who had been instrumental in gaining protected status for the Javari Valley.As they headed upriver, soldiers blew up 10 dredgers. Funai officials quizzed crews and left the soliders working to reopen one of the agency’s bases on the Jandiatuba River, which had been closed in 2012.This was important to deter garimpeiros from entering the area, says Beto Marubo, an indigenous leader working to raise international attention over the threats to the Javari Valley’s 16 isolated tribes.“Without these bases, the isolated Indians who roam this territory become vulnerable,” he says.The Funai group carried on up the Jandiatuba River. Before reaching Três Bocas, they had found an abandoned gold dredger. At the site of the alleged massacre, they found no sign of the killings – though what evidence would have remained after three months is unclear. No police took part in the expedition.This was a difficult trip involving arduous travelling through remote and inhospitable terrain, says Bruno Pereira, the Funai isolated indigenous specialist who led a team that included Jair Candor, one of Funai’s most experienced isolated authorities (featured in award-winning documentary Piripkura). Since 1987, Funai has avoided contact with isolated tribes – who have attacked and killed employees in the past, and been decimated by viruses passed on by outsiders. Trekking inland in search of signs that the tribe was healthy, they came across a plantation of fruit and vegetables, then a settlement. Because of the seriousness of the denunciation, they decided to enter and found fires still smouldering, temporary thatched-roof shelters called tapiri, slings for blowpipes, clay pots, arrowheads, bones of tapir, wild boar and alligator that had been cooked and eaten, as well as a body-length ceremonial mask.If the alleged massacre had happened, it was unlikely that this established settlement would still be there, he says, because isolated groups flee danger. This conclusion is shared by Daniel Mayaruna, 44, an indigenous man from Javari who was also on the expedition. Daniel saw a community of his “relatives” in good shape, but says the abandoned mining barge just 10km away was profoundly worrying.“There are a lot of isolated relatives in this region and my concern is that garimpeiros could kill them,” he says. Adam Mol, a volunteer Polish doctor, shot video footage of the village. “We didn’t find any indications of a massacre,” he says.Accusations of massacres are not unknown in the Javari Valley. Last August Bruno Pereira, the Funai official responsible for monitoring its isolated groups, led an expedition in the south of the reserve, following reports of another mass killing related by an indigenous man. Mol went with him.Mol brought a drone along – equipment that Funai did not have. The agency has been decimated by budget cuts under the austerity regime of President Michel Temer. As the expedition headed along the Jutaí River, around the area where the killing allegedly took place, they came across a small camp on the side of the water that the isolated group had just vacated, leaving an axe, bow and arrow and other artefacts behind. Then Mol’s drone spotted the main village just a kilometre away, with people, communal thatched buildings, and plantations. They retreated, reasoning that the group would have moved had they suffered a massacre.“The drone footage gave us the intel we needed,” says Mol.Both cases underline just how hard it is to investigate allegations of possible crimes in such remote regions. In Tabatinga, federal prosecutor Pablo Beltrand says the tip-off over the supposed Jutaí River massacre was “not such a reliable report” and presented “contradictions”. On the alleged massacre involving the tip-off, Beltrand has just received Funai’s report on the expedition and is analysing it. The agency had been reluctant to share sensitive information, such as the location of isolated groups. That the isolated tribe has stayed in the region is “something to be considered in the investigation”, Beltrand says. He has yet to conclude his inquiry. But he has little to go on – a paddle, a conversation, an anonymous denunciation. Meanwhile, smaller wooden mining barges are now reportedly being built beside a river in São Paulo de Olivença. The garimpeiros may yet return.

But what’s the real story behind the rise? Three mothers talk about the joy of finally having a baby long after it would once have been possibleTo celebrate reaching half a century, Gemma Barnes wrote a list of the 50 things she hoped to achieve. Topping it was an ambition that a few years ago would have seemed absurd: she wanted to have a baby. But two years on, Barnes is cuddling her eight-month-old daughter, and while that means most of the other 49 ambitions will have to wait, she is delighted to be a mother.Barnes’s situation is unusual, but she is certainly not alone. In June data published by the Office for National Statistics showed the number of births to 50-plus women has quadrupled over the last two decades, up from 55 in 2001 to 238 in 2016. During that period there were 1,859 births in the UK to women over 50, and 153 to women over 55. Flying the flag for older motherhood have been a host of celebrities, most recently actor Brigitte Nielsen who was 54 when her fifth child, a daughter named Frida, arrived this summer. US singer Janet Jackson gave birth in January, aged 50, to son Eissa. Perhaps most visible of all has been US Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq veteran who lost both legs when her helicopter was shot down in 2004. She gave birth earlier this year, also aged 50, and was photographed soon afterwards, protesting against Trump’s immigration policies while holding newborn Maile on her lap.At first, Barnes wasn’t sure whether she wanted to go down that route. “You want your baby to be yours. I was thinking, would she look like me? Would she have my nose? My hair colour? But the doctor started talking about how when you carry a baby you shape so much about his or her personality and behaviour during the pregnancy. I started to think that was right, and that carrying the child was very important.”Having made the decision to go ahead, there was an egg donor as well as a sperm donor to choose. “You do it all online and it seems a bit surreal, and yes, you do think you’re playing God. These two people will never meet, never know one another, and together their cells will create a baby – your baby. It felt a huge responsibility, especially as I was making decisions all on my own.”Philippa Hodgson, who is 58 and the mother of a four-year-old, was similarly unsure at first about whether to use an egg donor, but like Barnes went ahead when she realised it would give her the best chance of a baby. She had met her husband when she was 45 her daughter Roxanne was conceived using his sperm and a donor egg. “I was very shocked at first by the idea that we could use another woman’s egg,” she says. “I felt my child wouldn’t really be my own. But now she’s here I couldn’t love her more. Occasionally she does something that I don’t recognise as being connected to either my husband or myself and I think, how beautiful – that must be because of something in her genes from the donor.”Despite being reconciled to using a donated egg, though, neither Barnes nor Hodgson has told everyone in their lives about that element of their story, and nor has the third mother I spoke to, Carol, who is 61 and has children aged 13 and 10. (Barnes and Hodgson are pseudonyms Carol is happy to use her first name.) Carol’s feeling is that her decision to use an egg donor is not secret information, but it is private – and it would invade her children’s privacy to broadcast it to the world. All three women, incidentally, are entirely committed to telling their children how they were conceived. Hodgson says she talked to her little girl recently about it: “I told her that a kind lady gave me an egg because mummy couldn’t use her own eggs. And she replied, ‘You are my only mummy.’ I was gobsmacked.”All the same, some professionals working in the field of later-life pregnancy are concerned about what Nina Barnsley, director of the Donor Conception Network, which supports families with children born as a result of donated gametes, describes as a “fog” around the subject, because so few women feel able to be open about egg donation: “It’s still a taboo. Many older mothers feel they are up against it enough in terms of other people’s views, and being open about this would be something else to criticise them for.” Celebrities, meanwhile, are often coy about the precise details of how they conceived, giving rise to the misconception that young people can postpone pregnancy until their sixth decade. “As a society we need to have a proper conversation,” says Barnsley. “The technology means it’s possible to have babies until we’re 75 – but is that what we want?”Adam Balen, professor of reproductive medicine at Leeds University and fertility spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, shares Barnsley’s concerns. “We’re not very good in the west at preventative medicine, and in the world of infertility we are treating lots of things that could have been prevented,” he says. If IVF has the reputation for being a panacea then that, he stresses, is misplaced. “IVF doesn’t work for everyone, and it’s not available on the NHS for everyone.” As well as being expensive (some of the women I spoke to have spent upwards of £20,000 on their quest for a baby, and anecdotally others have spent far more), late pregnancy carries risks, says Balen. Miscarriage and pre-eclampsia, in particular, are more likely and the use of donated gametes increases those risks. Stresses around assisted conception can also affect a relationship.Both Carol and Hodgson have been mistaken for their child’s grandmother but all three women say they look a lot younger than their years and that few other mothers seem to clock that there is anything unusual about their family. Perhaps, Barnes muses, it takes a woman who feels younger than she is to e into late motherhood.For Gemma, being older didn’t mean biting her nails with worry through the pregnancy. “Because the egg was from a younger donor, the risks aren’t so great. I felt fantastic throughout. I concentrated on staying calm, on connecting with the baby growing inside me.” Most older mothers are advised, as she was, to have a caesarean. “It was a very easy birth: it took 10 minutes to get her out, and half an hour to stitch me up. And of course meeting her was so wonderful – I’d waited a long time for that moment.”For Carol, though, pregnancy was a scary time. “I had miscarried in the past and knew I had a higher chance of miscarrying because of my age. I felt I had so much to lose – it was never going to be a question of ‘you can give it another shot’ the way it would be for a younger woman,” she says. She developed pre-eclampsia towards the end of her first pregnancy and both her babies were born by caesarean. Unlike Barnes, she found that a “very peculiar” experience. Once her babies had arrived, though, she loved the early weeks and months with them. “I felt I appreciated them in a way that you perhaps only do with something that hasn’t been easy,” she says. She struggles to think of any way being older has disadvantaged her children.“I know plenty of people much younger than me who don’t seem to have much energy,” she says. “I think I do as much with my children as the other mothers I know – I only recently stopped bouncing on the trampoline with them. I don’t feel significantly different from when I was younger.” And then, she says, there are the advantages. “I stopped working by the time I had children, so I’ve been able to put all my time and energy into their lives.” Barnes works part-time, but feels she is able to devote more of her time to her daughter Hannah (not her real name) than she could have done when she was younger. “I’m in a much better place now than I was 20 years ago,” she says. “I’m very settled in myself, very content. I’m fitter than I’ve ever been, I’ve got enough money to be comfortably off and to provide for her. Hannah is everything to me and I don’t have to prove myself.”Understandably, the women who are making it work want to concentrate on the positives they bat off any suggestions that there might be disadvantages. “I don’t feel different from anyone else at mother and baby groups because, quite simply, no one has any idea I’m older,” says Barnes. “Having a baby is a great leveller. When you’re mixing with other parents it’s all about them, how they’re sleeping and feeding and so on. No one asks you how old you are.” Carol is more selfconscious about her age, perhaps because she is now in her 60s and has a child still at primary school. “Telling people how old I am is always a bit scary: you think, will people see me in a different light? I’m very careful about who I share it with. I don’t mind telling friends who have got to know me, but people I don’t know are more likely to judge me in a negative way.”She has also found her own needs squeezed between those of her children and her parents. “I had a very difficult stage where every time the phone rang I didn’t know whether it would be someone calling from school to say my son needed me or someone calling to say one of my frail parents had fallen down the stairs.” And if her own parents have had their experience of grandparenting curtailed, she knows that is likely to be repeated. “Will I ever be a grandmother? I do wonder about that.” Meanwhile, she says, some of her friends are already grandparents. “It does seem a bit strange, that we’re the same age but in such different situations,” she says.Barnsley has some concerns about the trend. “Fiftysomething motherhood will only ever be a choice for the well-off,” she says. “And some women will spend a lot of money on something that doesn’t, in the end, work out. Imagine borrowing £50,000 and then being unsuccessful.” She also wonders where the child’s perspective is in the debate. “I’m thinking of 21-year-olds who instead of travelling the world will be looking after a parent with Alzheimer’s,” she says. “They run the risk of being out of sync with their peers, and that might not be easy.” (This is also, of course, the case for men who have children in their 50s and over, although that is less rarely raised as an issue.)Barnes believes later-life motherhood will become much more common and she welcomes it. “The only two disadvantages, as I see it, are genetics – ie your child doesn’t share your genes – and the risk of dying while your children are still young.” Like Hodgson, she found the genetic issues faded into the background once her baby appeared, although she does sometimes worry about Hannah’s medical history, and what she might not know about it. In the future, she thinks young women will be encouraged to freeze their eggs for later use, as is currently being debated but at present in the UK human eggs can usually only be frozen for a decade, and fertility specialists say eggs from a woman’s 20s and early 30s would give her the best chance of a child in her 50s. So for egg freezing to be useful, the law would have to change – and some fertility clinics would like to see that happen. Other countries have different guidelines and legislation around fertility, and some British women travel to Spain, Cyprus and India in the hope of making it easier for themselves.One thing everyone seems to be in agreement on is that it would be better for young people in particular, and the whole population in general, to know more about fertility. Hodgson wishes she had learned more about it at school. In his role as chair of the British Fertility Society, Balen has called for the curriculum to be widened to teach young people about how to achieve pregnancy, as well as how to avoid it. And yet, one major reason women are tending to leave pregnancy until their 30s is for economic reasons: most twentysomethings can barely afford to pay the rent, let alone provide for a family. Workplace pressures on thirtysomethings to get promoted and zip up the career ladder is another factor weighing against younger motherhood and however well-informed teenagers become about fertility, there is no guarantee they will meet the person they want to raise a child with before the age of 35.Kamal Ahuja, scientific director of the London Women’s Clinic, which treats women up to the age of 50 but makes occasional exceptions for over-50s, says that while any doctor would advise childbearing in a woman’s 20s or early 30s, the emotional, financial and social realities, added to the fact that human beings are living “stronger, longer and with greater ambitions” mean the trend is almost certainly set to grow. He predicts that medical advances will make it easier and cheaper in the years ahead.Gemma Barnes, meanwhile, hasn’t written her to-do list for her 52nd birthday, which is coming up later this year. But when I ask her what’s going on it she smiles broadly and says she is definitely not ruling out a brother or sister for Hannah."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dd72a7592cecebbb64a577e3f3731ad949fa050/0_0_10663_6400/master/10663.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3a095ba84f19a1e77427865e6d1f944","title":"the inescapable weight of my 100000 student debt","story":" MH Miller left university with a journal full of musings on Virginia Woolf and a vast financial burden. He is one of 44 million US graduates struggling to repay a total of $1.4tn. Were they right to believe their education was ‘priceless’?On Halloween in 2008, about six weeks after Lehman Brothers collapsed, my mother called me from Michigan to tell me that my father had lost his job in the sales department of Visteon, an auto parts supplier for Ford. Two months later, my mother lost her job working for the city of Troy, a suburb about half an hour from Detroit. From there our lives seemed to accelerate, the terrible events compounding fast enough to elude immediate understanding. By June, my parents, unable to find any work in the state where they spent their entire lives, moved to New York, where my sister and I were both in school. A month later, the mortgage on my childhood home went into default.After several months of unemployment, my mother got a job in New York City, fundraising for a children’s choir. In the summer of 2010, I completed my studies at New York University, where I received a BA and an MA in English literature, with more than $100,000 of debt, for which my father was a guarantor. My father was still unemployed and my mother had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. She continued working, though her employer was clearly perturbed that she would have to take off every Friday for chemotherapy. To compensate for the lost time, on Mondays she rode early buses into the city from the Bronx, where, after months of harrowing uncertainty, my parents had settled. She wanted to be in the office first thing.In January 2011, Chase Bank took full possession of the house in Michigan. Our last ties were severed by an email my father received from the realtor, who had tried and failed to sell the property, telling him he could now cancel the utilities. In May, I got a freelance contract with a newspaper that within a year would hire me full-time – paying me, after taxes, roughly $900 every two weeks. In September 2011, my parents were approved for bankruptcy, and in October, due to a paperwork error, their car was repossessed in the middle of the night by creditors. Meanwhile, the payments for my debt – which had been borrowed from a variety of federal and private lenders, most prominently Citibank – totalled about $1,100 a month.Now 30, I have been incapacitated by debt for a decade. The delicate balancing act that my family and I perform in order to make a payment each month has become the organising principle of our lives. I am just one of 44 million borrowers in the US who owe a total of more than $1.4 trillion in student loan debt. This number is almost incomprehensibly high, and yet it continues to increase, with no sign of stopping. Legislation that might help families in financial hardship has failed in Congress. A bill introduced in May 2017, the Discharge Student Loans in Bankruptcy Act, which would undo changes made to the bankruptcy code in the early 2000s, stalled in committee. Despite all evidence that student loan debt is a national crisis, the majority of the US government – the only organisation with the power to resolve the problem – refuses to acknowledge its severity.My debt was the result, in equal measure, of a chain of rotten luck and a system that is an abject failure by design. My parents never lived extravagantly. In the first years of their marriage, my father drove a cab. When they had children and my father started a career in the auto industry, we became firmly middle-class, never wanting for anything, even taking vacations once a year, to places like Myrtle Beach or Miami. Still, there was usually just enough money to cover the bills – car leases, a mortgage, groceries. My sister and I both attended public school. The cost of things was discussed constantly. In my freshman year of high school, I lost my yearbook, which cost $40 my mother very nearly wept. College, which cost roughly $50,000 a year, was the only time that money did not seem to matter. “We’ll find a way to pay for it,” my parents said repeatedly, and if we couldn’t pay for it immediately, there was always a bank willing to give us a loan. This was true even after my parents had both lost their jobs amid the global financial meltdown. Like many well-meaning but misguided baby boomers, neither of my parents received an elite education, but they nevertheless believed that an expensive school was not a waste of money it was the key to a better life for their children. They continued to put faith in this falsehood even after a previously unimaginable financial loss, and so we continued spending money that we didn’t have – money that banks kept giving to us.I have spent a great deal of time during the last decade shifting the blame for my debt. Whose fault was it? My devoted parents, for encouraging me to attend a school they couldn’t afford? The banks, which should have never lent money to people who clearly couldn’t pay it back to begin with, continuously exploiting the hope of families like mine, and quick to exploit us further once that hope disappeared? Or was it my fault for not having the foresight to realise it was a mistake to spend roughly $200,000 on a school where, in order to get my degree, I kept a journal about reading Virginia Woolf? (Sample passage, which assuredly blew my mind at the time: “We are interested in facts because we are interested in myth. We are interested in myth insofar as myth constructs facts.”) The problem, I think, runs deeper than blame. The foundational myth of an entire generation of Americans was the false promise that education was priceless – that its value was above or beyond its cost. College was not a right or a privilege, but an inevitability on the way to a meaningful adulthood. What an irony that the decisions I made about college when I was 17 have derailed such a goal.After the dust settled on the collapse of the economy, on my family’s lives, we found ourselves in an impossible situation: we owed more each month than we could collectively pay. And so we wrote letters to Citibank’s mysterious PO box address in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, begging for help, letters that I doubt ever met a human being. We grew to accept Citibank as a detestable Moloch that we feared and hated, but were made to worship. The letters began to comprise a diary for my father in particular, a way to communicate a private anguish that he mostly bottled up, as if he was storing it for later. In one letter, addressed “Dear Citi,” he pleaded for a longer-term plan with lower monthly payments. He described how my mother’s mounting medical bills, as well as Chase Bank’s collection on our foreclosed home, had forced the family into bankruptcy, which provided no protection in the case of private student loans. We were not asking, in the end, for relief or forgiveness, but merely to pay them an amount we could still barely afford. “This is an appeal to Citi asking you to work with us on this loan,” he wrote to no one at all.Finally, at the beginning of 2012, my father started writing to the office of Congressman Joseph Crowley, who represented the district in the Bronx where my parents had relocated. In one of these letters, he described watching Too Big to Fail, an HBO film about the financial crisis, which had come out several months earlier. (My parents lost every asset they had, but they still subscribed to HBO, which became more than TV for them – a symbolic relic of their former class status.)The recession was over, officially anyway, and people who had not suffered its agonies were already profiting from its memory. Recession films often took place in the gleaming offices of hedge funds and investment banks, with attractive celebrities offering sympathetic portrayals of economists and bankers – Zachary Quinto, in 2011’s Margin Call, for instance, plays a rocket scientist turned risk analyst with a heart of gold, a do-gooder who discovers that his employer has leveraged itself to the edge of bankruptcy. These films often depicted figures who experienced little to no repercussions for their roles in leading the country into a recession, who abused the misfortune of people like my parents – unmentionables who owed more on their houses than what they had paid for them and, of course, rarely featured in the story at all.My father described himself and my mother to Crowley as “the poster children for this entire financial event”, by which he meant Americans who seemed to have done everything right on paper, but in doing so contributed to their own downfall. By the time he wrote to Crowley, my father was working again, but it had taken him two years to find another job, which paid him much less money. After his run of financial calamity, he knew better than to believe anything good would last. “We are in our 60s and I figure when we get to our mid-70s life will become difficult again,” he wrote.Crowley’s office wrote back. It was the first time in about two years that a person had responded to our correspondence with encouragement, or something like it. Someone who worked for his office in Washington helped to arrange a conference call with government liaisons from Citigroup to discuss a different payment plan. The monthly payments to Citi were then more than $800 a month, and we were trying to talk them into letting us pay the loan over a longer period, at a rate of about $400 a month. These terms were reasonable enough, but the response to this request was like an automated message brought to life: “We are precluded from a regulatory perspective from being able to do what you are asking,” each of the representatives said. What made these exchanges more ridiculous was the fact that Citibank was in the process of retreating from the student loan market by selling off my debt to Discover Financial, who would give us the same response. We were nothing to these companies but a number in a database. And they fully controlled our fates.I used to wonder if the people who worked for these lenders had families of their own, and if they would ever find themselves bankrupt, wondering where they were going to live. Most of all, I wondered what they would do if their own children had to take out loans to pay for college. After 10 years of living with the fallout of my own decisions about my education, I have come to think of my debt as like an alcoholic relative from whom I am estranged, but who shows up to ruin happy occasions. But when I first got out of school and the reality of how much money I owed finally struck me, the debt was more of a constant and explicit preoccupation, a matter of life and death.I had studied English because I wanted to be a writer. I never had an expectation of becoming rich. I didn’t care about money. My MA fed an intellectual curiosity that eventually led me to newspapers, and I don’t regret that my translation of The Dream of the Rood from Old English to contemporary vernacular was not a terribly marketable or even applicable skill. I understand now the extent to which I was among the most overeducated group of young adults in human history. Still, following completion of this degree, I enrolled for an evening class in French at New York’s Cooper Union, as that deferred my having to start paying off the debt, and the cost of the new class was cheaper than the monthly repayments I would have to make. Once I could no longer delay and the payments began, a question echoed through my head from the moment the day began, and often jolted me awake at night. I would look at the number on my paycheck and obsessively subtract my rent, the cost of a carton of eggs and a can of beans (my sustenance during the first lean year of this mess), and the price of a loan payment. The question was: What will you do when the money from the paycheck is gone?I never arrived at an answer to this question. At my lowest points, I began fantasising about dying, not because I was suicidal, but because death would have meant relief from having to come up with an answer. My life, I felt, had been assigned a monetary value – I knew what I was worth, and I couldn’t afford it, so all the better to cash out early. The debt was mind-controlling – how I would eat or pay my rent without defaulting was a constant refrain, and I had long since abandoned any hope of a future in which I might have a meaningful line of credit or a disposable income, or even simply own something – but it was also mind-numbingly banal. I spent a great deal of time filling out paperwork over and over again, or waiting on hold for extended periods in order to speak to a robotic voice that would reject my request. It didn’t matter what the request was or who I was asking. It was always rejected.And so it felt good to think about dying, in the way that it felt good to take a long nap in order to not be conscious for a while. These thoughts culminated in November 2010, when I met with my father one afternoon at a diner in Brooklyn to retrieve more paperwork. My hope for some forgiving demise had resulted in my being viciously sick for about 10 days, with what turned out to be strep throat. I refused to go to the doctor in the hope that my condition might worsen into a more serious infection that, even if it didn’t kill me, might force someone to at last lavish me with pity. I coughed up a not insignificant portion of yellowish fluid before my father and I entered the restaurant. We sat at a table, and I frowned at the forms he handed me. I started the conversation by asking, “Theoretically, if I were to, say, kill myself, what would happen to the debt?”“I would have to pay it myself,” my father said, in the same tone he would use a few minutes later to order eggs. He paused and then offered me a melancholy smile, which I sensed had caused him great strain. “Listen, it’s just debt,” he said. “No one is dying from this.”My father had suffered in the previous two years. In a matter of months, he had lost everything he had worked most of his adult life to achieve – first his career, then his home, then his dignity. He had become a 60-year-old man who had quite reluctantly shaved his greying, 40-year-old mustache in order to look younger, shuffling between failed job interviews where he was often told he had “too much experience”. He was ultimately forced out of the life he’d known, dragging with him, like some 21-first-century Pa Joad, a U-Haul trailer crammed with family possessions, including, at the insistence of my mother, large plastic tubs of my childhood action figures.Throughout this misery, my father had reacted with what I suddenly realised was stoicism, but which I had long mistaken for indifference. This misunderstanding was due in part to my mother, whom my father mercifully hadn’t lost, and who had suffered perhaps most of all. Not that it was a competition, but if it were, I think she would have taken some small amount of satisfaction in winning it. The loss of home and finances felt at least like a worthy opponent for cancer, and yet here was my father telling me that none of this was the end of the world. I felt a flood of sympathy for him. I was ashamed of my selfishness. The lump in my throat began to feel less infectious than lachrymal. “OK,” I said to him, and that was that. When I got home I scheduled an appointment with a doctor.Navient released a public statement in reponse to that suit, which said: “There is no expectation that the servicer will act in the interest of the consumer.” When I received a notice from Navient in February 2017 that my monthly payments would be increasing, for reasons I did not comprehend, the email came with a note at the bottom saying: “We’re here to help: We’re happy to help you navigate your options, provide you with resources, and answer any questions you have as you repay your loans.” The company’s motto is, hilariously, “Solutions for your success”.These announcements flooded my inbox with subject lines declaring “Important Information”, but none of them altered my fate. Sometimes the monthly payments would go up, sometimes my salary would go up, sometimes I made a cheque out to a different company. The only stable thing was the money I owed, which never seemed to get any lower. And so the cash would go out to the various lenders with the blind hope that it was right. On top of all that was a dreadful anticipation that any day now I might hear from the credit bureau and my life would somehow bottom out.In some twisted way, I wanted it to happen. My mother’s cancer went into remission, and both of my parents found, in their 60s, new careers in New York. I maintained steady employment in journalism since finishing school, and in 2016 I was hired as an editor at the New York Times. Was it possible we had become lucky? I had spent so much time wondering what life’s nadir looked like that I was now curious whether it had already come and gone.In the summer of 2017, my father, now nearing 70, had lost another job, so I finally removed him as a guarantor and refinanced my loans with one of the few companies that provides such a service, SoFi. My wife, who agreed to marry me last autumn, would help with the payments when she could. Sharing the burden of my debt with my spouse instead of my parents was a small, depressing victory, a milestone perhaps unique to members of my generation, one that must have carried the same kind of significance that purchasing a home and having a mortgage had to my parents.SoFi has not made my situation much more tenable. The main difference is that I now write one cheque instead of several, and I have an end date for when the debt, including the calculated interest – about $182,000 – will be paid off: 2032, when I’ll be 44, a number that feels only slightly less theoretical to me than 30 did when I was 17. What I have to pay each month is still, for the most part, more than I am able to afford, and it has kept me in a state of perpetual childishness. I rely on the help of people I love, and I live by each paycheck. I still harbour anxiety about the bad things that could befall me should the paycheck disappear.But the “Important Information” I receive has changed. SoFi is a Silicon Valley startup that bills itself as “a new kind of finance company” its name is shorthand for Social Finance, Inc. In addition to loans, it offers membership outreach in the form of financial literacy workshops and free dinners. Their aim is to “empower our members” – a mission that was called into question by the resignation, in September 2017, of its CEO, Mike Cagney, who employees allege had engaged in serial workplace sexual harassment and who ran the office, according to a New York Times headline, like “a frat house.” The allegations, according to a report in the Times, include Cagney exchanging explicit text messages with employees, bragging about the size of his genitalia, and the company’s chief financial officer offering bonuses to female employees if they lost weight. In January, SoFi hired Anthony Noto, formerly of Twitter, as Cagney’s replacement.SoFi has also received criticism for its elitism, and for courting only wealthy, high-earning borrowers – to which I can only say this is a category with which I do not personally identify, especially after writing the check to SoFi each month. The news ahout Cagney came out not long after I refinanced my loans with the company – I became, I suppose, a SoFi’er, in the company’s parlance. Around the same time, I started receiving curious emails from them: “You’re Invited: 2 NYC Singles Events” or “Come Celebrate Pride with us!”I will reiterate that I am a 30-year-old married man with more than $100,000 of debt, who makes less each year than what he owes. Buying a pair of trousers is a major financial decision for me. I do not think myself eligible in any sense of the word, nor do I find my debt to be amusing merely on a conversational level.Still, I felt as if in 10 years, the debt hadn’t changed, but the world had, or at least the world’s view of it. This thing, this 21st-century blight that had been the source of great ruin and sadness for my family, was now so normal – so basic – that it had been co-opted by the wellness industry of Silicon Valley. My debt was now approachable, a way to meet people. It was, in other words, an investment in my future, which is why I had gone into debt in the first place. Would SoFi be this friendly if I lost my job and missed a monthly payment?Let’s say I was morbidly intrigued. The day after Valentine’s Day, I went to a Mexican restaurant in the financial district for a SoFi community dinner – this was not a singles event, but simply a free meal. There had been another of these dinners near my apartment the week before, but it had, to my surprise, quickly sold out. The restaurant was packed with an after-work crowd in business attire, and SoFi had rented out the back room, where a few dozen people had gathered, all wearing name tags and discussing financial woes. Sid, a software developer from Queens who had racked up credit card debt after college, told me that the debt was a unifying force at these gatherings. “When there’s a break in the conversation, someone can just say, ‘So, debt, huh?’ and things will get going again,” he said. “If we walked outside of this room,” he continued, gesturing to the suits by the bar, “everyone out there would have debt, too. It’s just a little more out in the open for us.”Despite the name tags, the dinner turned out to resemble something more like an AA meeting, an earnest session of group therapy. Everyone had their story about the problems caused by their student loans and how they were trying, one day at a time, to improve things, and no story was exceptional, including my own. Ian, an employee for Google who had recently successfully paid off his debt from a Columbia MBA programme, became something like my sponsor for the evening. He said he had a few “bone dry” years, when he lived on instant noodles. I told him I had a long way to go. “At least you’re doing something about it,” he said, sincerely.We sat down to dinner. Across from me was Mira, a defence attorney from Brooklyn, who attended law school at Stanford. Her payments amount to $2,300 a month, more than double my own. When I asked her why she came to this event, she glanced at me as if the answer should have been obvious: her payments are $2,300 a month. The table, myself included, looked on her with an odd reverence. She wore a business suit and had her hair pulled back, but I saw her as something like the sage and weathered biker of the group, talking in her wisdom about accepting the things you cannot change.After the food was served, a waiter came by with a stack of to-go boxes, which sat on the edge of the table untouched for a while as everyone cautiously eyed them. The group was reluctant at first, but then Ian said, “The chicken was actually pretty good,” as he scooped it into one of the boxes. Mira shrugged, took a fork, and said: “This is a little tacky, but I’d hate to waste free food,” and the rest of the table followed her lead. Maybe the next generation would do better, but I felt like we were broke and broken. No number of degrees or professional successes would put us back together again. For now, though, we knew where our next meal was coming from.This article first appeared in the current issue of the Baffler• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a870454a356d016e783caf1e8f3fbe02eec04d4/0_415_5999_3601/master/5999.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af91c04d6ab23ff8606bcc7cebc33f49","title":"financial services paper to be published on no deal brexit","story":"Document intended to clarify government plans should Britain crash out of EUA Brexit “no-deal” impact paper for financial services has been listed among the first batch of official assessments due to be published on Thursday, at a time when banks and insurers have been warning about the risks of a disorderly exit from the EU.The paper was unexpectedly slated as one of about 20 “no-deal” papers to be published, covering subjects as erse as nuclear research, farm payments and state aid. The government wants to spell out what action it will have to take should the UK crash out of the EU.Downing Street had been hoping that the first batch of documents would generate relatively little controversy, which is why the presence of the banking paper on the publication list has surprised Whitehall sources.UK Finance, the trade body for the finance sector, warned that a no-deal scenario needed to be addressed urgently “to avoid the risk of a serious breakdown in cross-border financial services in March 2019”. It is particularly concerned about continuity in contracts and the flow of data across the UK-EU border given a hard Brexit.Ministers could yet pull the financial services paper from the documents published on Thursday, and Downing Street has so far refused to confirm which of the 84 no-deal assessments will be released in the first batch. The remainder will be released in September.A health paper may also be released in the first wave, coming after NHS Providers, an NHS organisation, warned that hospitals could run short of drugs or even out of them in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, is due to give a speech setting out the context for the release of the papers on Thursday morning, having returned from Brussels where he was meeting Michel Barnier in the latest round of orce negotiations.Other papers expected to be released in the first batch include one entitled Future participation in Erasmus+, referring to the European Union’s education, training and sport schemes. The papers are understood to be relatively short, anywhere between two and five pages, and all follow a set template. The idea is to set out what actions government would have to take in each sector in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and to help clarify for businesses and organisations how they might need to respond.Growing worries about the possibility of a no-deal, a possibility talked up by ministers as a negotiating tactic, have hit the pound in recent months, with sterling touching 12-month lows during August. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, warned this month that the risks of a no-deal Brexit were “uncomfortably high”. He said that he had asked UK banks to ensure they had the liquidity and the capital in place if needed.On Tuesday Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, suggested that a post-Brexit immigration policy should favour those who want to go to the UK because of a job offer, as he sought to talk up the country’s economic prospects after leaving the EU.Fox said the 2016 referendum result demonstrated that the British public had rejected free movement, but said any plans had to take into account the UK’s employment needs.“I think the public can differentiate between people who come here with a job and will be contributing to the economy and those who, under free movement, were able to come to the UK and use our public services without ever having contributed to them,” Fox told LBC radio. “We need to look in the future at how we match our employment opportunities with our migration policy,” he added, suggesting he favoured a two-tier system.Britain has yet to spell out what sort of migration policy it wants to introduce after Brexit. A much-delayed white paper on the topic is due to be published at some point in the autumn. Net migration is supposed to be limited to 100,000 people a year, although the target has never been achieved.The Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, who acts as a spokesperson for the pro-remain campaign group Best for Britain, asked whether Fox was signalling government policy in which there would be free movement into the UK for people with job offers.“Liam Fox needs to come clean and tell us: is this the government’s plan or just more shooting from the hip?” Moran said. She said she believed free movement had benefited Britain and should be protected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f92934931c54af2bbfd9530a21678c1c375d6a8e/0_0_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00fe3106cc59c091acc5f9e1eb1b5981","title":"call for two years further freedom of movement after brexit","story":"Thinktank warns of labour shortages in London and the south-east without EU dealBritain would face labour shortages in London and the south-east from a no-deal Brexit, according to a report calling for the government to extend freedom of movement for EU migrants to protect the wider economy.The Centre for Cities thinktank urged the government to extend freedom of movement for two years after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019, in the event of no deal on the terms of exit and future relations with the union.Publishing a report on EU citizens working in British towns and cities across the country, the Centre for Cities warned cities such as Oxford, Cambridge and London, where the vote was in favour of remaining in the EU, are reliant on EU migrants, making them particularly vulnerable to tougher immigration rules should Britain crash out without a deal.The report said about one in 10 employees in major southern cities were from the EU. It said they had brought with them “significant economic benefits” to the wider British economy, which could be put at risk from a no-deal Brexit.The report comes ahead of the government’s publication of a series of technical notices detailing the impact of a no-deal Brexit.Suggesting the impact would be more complex and spread across the country, the report said many remain-voting metropolitan centres required continued access to the EU for low-skilled hospitality workers, as well as highly qualified professional services staff.Supporters of Brexit have repeatedly argued that EU migrants make it harder for British workers to find work. However the thinktank said losing them would raise questions over the ability of cities to prosper. It said many of the most productive places in the UK had higher proportions of EU workers.EU migration has slumped since the referendum, suggesting the UK has already become less attractive for many European workers. The report found migration from the rest of the EU has dropped in 51 out of 58 English and Welsh cities since before the referendum was held two years ago.The report called on the government to allow temporary visas for low-skilled workers, and scrap arbitrary restrictions on high-skilled workers. It also said there should be more government funding for training and education in cities to help address skills shortages in the long-term.Although ministers have committed to continued free movement during a two-year transition period until the end of 2020, failure to reach a deal with Brussels before the end of March could throw that into doubt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94ac045d92de66d331fa3d6745e326bda4145d80/0_0_2441_1006/master/2441.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2be88b50db22c5caef0275d01ce67a9f 700w","title":"dylan hartley excited new northampton coach","story":"• England captain made peace with missing South Africa tour• Hooker says he is enjoying learning from Chris BoydDylan Hartley expects to start the season with Northampton after taking the summer off to recover from concussion and the England captain is confident the Saints will mount a title challenge after a couple of seasons when they have floundered below the top four.Hartley missed the tour to South Africa after receiving advice to take an extended rest and his only medical problem was high blood pressure as he watched winning positions turn into defeats in England’s opening two Tests against the Springboks.“I got married and had a well-rested summer apart from getting agitated watching some rugby on television,” said Hartley, who has been named co-captain along with Alex Waller by Northampton’s new director of rugby, Chris Boyd. “I am not a good watcher but an energised one: my family have to leave the room as I get aggressive with cushions and aim bad language at the TV.“I was disappointed to miss the tour. Once I had made peace with a decision that was made for me, it was good because there was no target date to rush back for and I found myself instantly get better.The arrival of Boyd from the Hurricanes in Wellington will mark a change in playing style for Northampton, who have struggled to compete in an era when the breakdown has become the key feature.“There is a new air about the place and I feel like a 19-year-old on the first day of academy training,” said Hartley, who hopes to be involved in Friday’s friendly against Glasgow at Franklin’s Gardens. “Chris speaks a different rugby language to those I have known and I am enjoying learning.

A bizarre day’s cricket finished with England on 311 for nine, 210 short of victory. At one point when Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes were in harness it seemed likely that there would be some meaningful cricket left on the final day. Then, as England lost four wickets for 10 runs, the motorway beckoned. Yet somehow Adil Rashid, alongside Stuart Broad and then Jimmy Anderson, survived for an hour so that Trent Bridge must open its doors again on Wednesday.However, we know the Indian victory will be emphatic – the forecast is fine – and the teams will reunite at Southampton next week with the series alive at 2-1 and the England team thoroughly chastened at a ground where they usually prevail. This has been a retrograde performance by England and an inspired one by India, who have outplayed England in all three facets of the game: their bowlers were quicker and more hostile, the batsmen more adhesive and the same applied to the hands of their slip catchers despite a few blemishes.Perversely, the crowd made the best of it all, cheering Anderson and Rashid merrily as they survived the final overs of the day. In reality there were only two England players entitled to be cheerful, Buttler and Stokes, who shared a 169-run partnership in the afternoon, an oasis of calm amid much frenetic batting.Trent Bridge has announced adult tickets for the fifth day of the third Test match between England and India will go on sale on Wednesday for £10.England ensured the match will go into a fifth day after a brave last-wicket stand between Adil Rashid and Jimmy Anderson denied India victory. But with just one wicket required, Trent Bridge have resisted calls to allow supporters in for free but will be offering junior prices from £5, while Under 21 tickets in the William Clarke stand on sale for £9.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe always think long and hard about day five pricing when we go on sale each October, said the ground in a statement. Sometimes you’ll see a full day, sometimes a few overs. In 2013, the match was exceptionally well poised.\u0026nbspFor Buttler, especially, this was surely a landmark day in a unique career. Arriving at the crease with England languishing at 62 for four, he hit his maiden Test century, an innings of rare poise and purpose, and alongside Stokes, he suggested that English batsmanship is not entirely dormant. In the process Buttler further justified his surprising recall in May. Somehow in August the cricketing fates have now cast him as England’s vice-captain, wicketkeeper and a cast-iron choice in the team.There were plenty of silky strokes from the Buttler bat. He hit 21 boundaries in his century, a record he now shares with three other Englishmen, Alan Knott, Mark Butcher and Andrew Flintoff. But like Stokes, who displayed even greater self-denial, Buttler was prepared to grind at the start of his innings in a manner that seems alien to most English batsmen. Gradually he expanded his range of shots, all of which were of red-ball orthodoxy.For three hours batting was a breeze, especially when the sun came out and the ball aged. In the meantime Stokes, doggedly oblivious to runless periods – in fact, he almost seemed to relish them – dug in with great determination. But on either side of that partnership there was mayhem.The openers were gone within 20 minutes. It was all too simple for Ishant Sharma. He has swung the ball consistently away from the left-handers from around the wicket throughout the series and here he found the edge of dangling bats as easily as a fisherman reeling in his catch above a shoal of mackerel. Keaton Jennings nibbled to the keeper, Alastair Cook to KL Rahul, who has given a fine exhibition of slip fielding in this match.Ollie Pope hit his first ball down the ground for four in fine style as he continued his brief exploration of Test cricket. He looks the part while he is there the problem is that he has not been there for very long in his three Test innings. He is the greenhorn so he deserves more latitude and he has been asked to learn how to bat at four in the harsh environs of Test cricket.If the batting lineup is rejigged in Southampton because of the likely absence of Jonny Bairstow, Pope may drop in the order. While playing for Surrey in his brief first-class career he has never come to the crease before the 23rd over for England he has never entered the fray after the 13th over.Joe Root never settled, which is a worry. Over the last 12 months Root has seldom looked out of form even when he has not been scoring runs but here he was scratching around, his touch and timing oddly elusive. The worry is that Root, an intelligent man, is starting to wonder who the devil is going to score the runs if he fails. Maybe the performances of Buttler and Stokes can ease those concerns.The leading scorer in the County Championship, Burns is averaging 67.92. At 27, he has played more than 100 first-class matches but like Alastair Cook and Keaton Jennings he is another left-hander, and that counts against him.The 24-year-old left-hander is highly rated having come through the Lions pathway. Yet Gubbins is averaging mid-40s in Division Two of the Championship, with just one hundred this season.A right-handed opener who is fresh from scoring 178 against Yorkshire. At 34 he would not be a pick for the future but he does average above 40 over the past three years.\u0026nbspAs a teenager, the right-hander shone during his debut series in India two winters ago but a broken finger forced him out. Curiously he has seen his form crash at county level since, with three 50s in two years.\u0026nbsp Chris StocksHere Root poked at a wide delivery from Jasprit Bumrah, the stiff-armed, indefatigable paceman and Rahul routinely took the catch at second slip. Now Pope displayed his naivety. The next ball, bowled by Mohammed Shami at the start of the following over, was very wide and full Pope lunged and edged and Virat Kohli took a stunning catch at third slip. Then Buttler and Stokes calmly restored order for almost four hours.Finally the excellent Bumrah, armed with the second new ball, intervened explosively. Buttler padded up and was lbw next ball Bairstow emerged despite his fractured finger and lost his off stump first ball. Then Chris Woakes fended at a vicious bouncer and Stokes was furious to edge to second slip. Soon Rashid edged to Kohli off Bumrah with the score 245 for eight but it transpired that the bowler had overstepped by a millimetre. Somehow England added another 66 runs thereafter, a source of delight to those who stayed on in the evening sunshine and a few Nottingham hoteliers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21fc8fb8afcd462a7cbae064dded3152b5b24352/0_48_4713_2828/master/4713.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61b2fdb6486d9a3223f8b291860e4677","title":"poets word juddmonte international york","story":"The winners of £15m in prize money meet for what should be a thrilling Juddmonte International, in which Poet’s Word (3.35) can cement his status as the star horse of this Flat season.

But his exhilarating effort to reel in Crystal Ocean in the King George showed him to be the best we have seen this season. Sir Michael Stoute is already the leading trainer in this race’s history. Poet’s Word can give him a seventh success.The pacy Roaring Lion is a potent threat but he had just a neck to spare over Saxon Warrior in the Eclipse and much more will surely be needed.

Latrobe may be the most dangerous, having had a helpful break since his Irish Derby win.1.55 York There was some early interest in Holmeswood at double-figure odds when the betting opened on Tuesday night on this sprint handicap.

He travelled well for a long way last time.2.25 York Any Richard Hannon horse that wins on its debut is worth tracking, given his softly-softly approach, so there is no getting away from Watan here. He was green at Glorious Goodwood last month but still had two lengths in hand at the line after finishing powerfully.

The 74 pages, 70 accounts and three groups on Facebook and 76 Instagram accounts – some dating back to 2013 – posted political content focused on the Middle East, UK, US and Latin America. The pages had about 155,000 followers in total. The same group spent more than $6,000 on Facebook and Instagram ads paid for in US dollars, the last one running in August 2018.The cybersecurity company FireEye, which first identified the campaign and flagged the campaign to Facebook, said the intent behind the activity appeared to be to “promote Iranian political interests, including anti-Saudi, anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian themes, as well as promote support for specific US policies favorable to Iran, such as the US-Iran nuclear deal”. There was also significant anti-Trump messaging and the creation of sock puppet accounts masquerading as liberal Americans.FireEye noted that the activity did not appear to have been specifically designed to influence the US midterm elections as the content extended beyond US audiences and politics.The second campaign was linked to the first one and involved 12 pages and 66 accounts on Facebook and nine on Instagram. The inauthentic accounts posed as news organisations and engaged in cybersecurity attacks, including attempting to hack accounts and spread malware.The third Iranian campaign comprised 168 pages and 140 accounts on Facebook, and 31 on Instagram. They collectively hosted 25 events and about 813,000 Facebook users followed at least one of the pages. Facebook said the campaign mostly shared content about Middle East politics in Arabic and Farsi, but also shared content about politics in the UK and US. This group of accounts spent more than $6,000 in ads paid in US dollars, Turkish lira and Indian rupees between July 2012 and April 2018.Facebook was most vague about the fourth and final campaign, a collection of pages, groups and accounts linked to the Russian military intelligence services – with no links to the Iranian campaigns. These included some of the same bad actors removed before the 2016 US election, but the focus of their recent activity was spreading pro-Russia messaging relating to Syria and Ukraine.“To date, we have not found activity by these accounts targeting the US,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, head of cybersecurity policy.Facebook would not provide any more information about the nature of the Iranian and Russian content, but said that it had briefed the US and UK governments.“These investigations are ongoing – and given the sensitivity we aren’t sharing more information about what we removed,” Gleicher said.Today’s announcement comes less than a month after the social network deleted 32 pages and accounts attempting to influence the US midterm elections. The accounts pushed American political stances and organised events, including a protest against a Unite the Right rally in Washington.Facebook could not conclusively attribute the campaign to Russia, but said that the accounts showed “similar activity” and connections to other accounts associated with the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/692b8df040a697df4909df4647405bb9a37e62fe/0_0_4263_2558/master/4263.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3957d943a4eeac0af238e0790b40764c","title":"samsung galaxy note 9 review phone bluetooth s pen","story":"The phablet’s massive, beautiful screen, excellent performance and new Bluetooth stylus will have Note fans salivatingThe king of the big, powerful phones is back for another generation, but is the new Samsung Galaxy Note 9 still the phablet to beat?The Note series pioneered the big-screen smartphone in 2011 and over the last seven years it has been made larger and more feature-packed with each new version. Where the Galaxy S9 series is Samsung’s top-end phone for normal people, the Note 9 is the powerhouse for those that need the answer to the question “can I do that on my phone” always to be yes.The Note 9’s screen is big - at 6.4in it’s 0.1in bigger than the last version – but it’s only actually a smidgen larger than that fitted to the Galaxy S9+.Place the new phone next to the Note 8 and you’d be hard pressed to tell the difference, until you look a bit more closely. The bezels are slightly smaller and the aluminium band around the sides slightly more prominent. The dual-camera system now sits slightly proud of the glass back and the fingerprint scanner has been moved from alongside the cameras to below them. It’s a tiny change but makes a huge difference for usability.The screen is the best you can get on a smartphone, with bright, bold colours, inky blacks and great viewing angles. The Note has always been Samsung’s showcase for its best screen technology.The massive screen does have its downsides, though, as it makes the Note 9 fairly difficult to handle without two hands. If any phone would benefit from a ring or finger grip on the back, this is it. Samsung should have included a hand strap like the ones that came with phones in the early 2000s. It could sit next to the headphone jack.Like the Galaxy S9, the Note 9 has a different processor, depending on where you buy it. The European model has Samsung’s own Exynos 9810 chip and was the version tested, while the North American model has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 processor, which is used in the OnePlus 6 and other top-end phones released in 2018. Performance should be similar between the two versions, although there may be discrepancies at the extremes.The Note 9 is arguably the best performing Android device on the market, and is capable of maintaining that maximum performance for much longer without overheating, which was very noticeable in Shadowgun Legends compared with a Pixel 2XL or OnePlus 6.That was while using the Note 9 as my primary device with the always-on display active, while browsing and using apps for five hours with well over a hundred notifications, reading comics in Marvel Unlimited for 60 minutes, and listening to about five hours of music via Bluetooth headphones.For comparison, Huawei’s 6in Mate 10 Pro can last two full days between charges under similar conditions. It’s possible that the North American version of the Note 9 with the Qualcomm processor may have longer battery life.The Note 9 runs the latest version of Samsung’s modified Android called Samsung Experience 9.5. It’s based on Android 8.1 Oreo instead of the recently released Android 9 Pie, which is disappointing but not entirely unexpected.It looks and behaves similarly to the Note 8 or Galaxy S9+ with Samsung Experience 9. There are a few useful additions for the stylus and large screen, such as the pop-out Edge apps, advanced split-screen multitasking and the ability to pop-out apps to run as windows over others – all features present in the Note 8.On the whole the software on the Note 9 feels like Samsung’s best optimised yet, with smoother performance all round. It’s not quite as snappy as a OnePlus 6 or Google’s Pixel 2XL, but it feels as if Samsung has done a better job of limiting lag all over the system.The dual-camera system on the back is the same as that fitted to the Galaxy S9+. Two 12-megapixel cameras, one wide angle with dual aperture and the other a 2x telephoto camera.New for the Note 9 is an AI system for optimising scenes for shots, which worked fine when it recognised objects such as food and plants, but often created oversaturated images that look like they’ve been put through an Instagram filters. I turned it off and got better results. The AI is also meant to spot when the image is blurry or your subject has their eyes closed, but I couldn’t get it to alert me no matter how many shots of friends blinking I took.Lacklustre AI elements aside, the camera is brilliant, capturing a rich amount of detail, even with the telephoto lens, and in a range of lighting conditions. Low light performance was excellent too, as was the 8-megapixel selfie camera.Another new addition is a Bluetooth-enabled S Pen, which uses a supercapacitor to operate the S Pen away from the phone for up to 30 minutes or so. Slide the S Pen back into the body for a full charge in 40 seconds.Other than the usual scribbling on screen, you can now press the button to trigger actions on your phone, such as taking a picture in the camera app, pausing music or presenting the next slide in PowerPoint. Hold down the button and you can launch an app too.I didn’t find it overly useful, but I know that the feature has been on the wish lists of Note users for some time.If you need your phone to be able to do just about anything, the Note 9 is it. It has everything and the kitchen sink wrapped up into a massive powerhouse of a phone.As you might expect that comes with a few compromises, the biggest of which is the sheer size of the thing making it quite difficult to pocket and handle. It also costs a lot, although not quite as much as Apple’s significantly smaller iPhone X.The camera is great, the screen is amazing, the stylus useful and the myriad features don’t get in the way if you don’t use all of them. You can game for longer at maximum performance than other phones and even use it as a workable light desktop when hooked up to a monitor.The battery life is good but should be better given the size of the cell, and launching after the release of a new version of Android 9 Pie but running last year’s 8.1 Oreo isn’t ideal.The Note 9 really isn’t that much different than the Note 8, but is a huge step forward over older models. Note fans should be happy.Pros: good battery, impressive screen, water resistant, brilliant camera, Bluetooth S Pen, microSD card slot, wireless charging, lasting performance, DeX without the dock, headphone jackCons: only Android 8.1, expensive, very big for hands and pockets, fingerprint scanner should be lower down the back, Bixby still not good enough This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

That’s why it is in.”The new series begins next Tuesday with 12 amateur bakers, including a Bollywood-loving banker, a chatty nuclear scientist and a down-to-earth supermarket product demonstrator competing for the crown.In previous series, in among the regular biscuit, cake and bread weeks there has been a caramel week, a botanicals week and a Victorian week. For the ninth series there will be, for the first time, a Danish week and a vegan week.Both Hollywood and his fellow judge, Prue Leith, said they had learned a lot from the vegan experience. “If you are a vegan or you’re thinking about it and are just worried about how it is going to change your life, watch it and see,” said Hollywood. “It fascinated me, totally … shocked me as well.”He said the judging used the same criteria as any other week. “You can’t judge it and say it’s okay for vegan, it’s got to taste good, period. That’s how we judged it and we were surprised.”The show is in its second year of being on Channel 4 after it poached the programme from the BBC by offering more money. Despite fears it would not work as it was quintessentially BBC, the series was positively received and audiences warmed to the new hosts, Sandi Toksvig and Noel Fielding.Hollywood said a big hope was that the programme inspired people to bake. He said: “We want the general public to actually bake, that’s the point. Some of the challenges are very challenging and some of them we’ve just reined it back a little bit.”The first challenge in the new series will be wagon wheels – or as one contestant calls them, “wheelie-wagons”.Journalists on Tuesday were given an early preview of the first episode. During the showstopper challenge, contestants are asked to construct a spectacular biscuit selfie in a memorable setting. This led to Jon creating a lemon curd sun and buttered cream choppy sea to recreate a family sailing trip Ruby in a triple-layered 40-biscuit design, finishing the London marathon and Dan showing himself and his baby in Palm Springs.The episode kicks off with Toksvig and Fielding poking fun at Leith over how she tweeted last year’s winner several hours too early.Leith, who replaced Mary Berry as a second judge, said she had been more candid with contestants in this new series. “I think because I am more relaxed and a little bit more confident, I think that I’ve been straighter. I’ve found it easier to say, ‘that’s not properly baked’ … The last series I would tell them lots of things that were nice before I would say anything nasty.”One journalist watching the first episode complained there was not enough innuendo. Such quips came spontaneously, Leith said. “They just happen … Don’t worry, you’ll get some.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80396a32a894cf0bdef8efaaf1ab048dd4b4802a/488_375_2918_1751/master/2918.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc55ccbca13ff7506b80d5e120e7c2f0","title":"chris martin and damon albarn join campaign to free uganda star bobi wine","story":"Musical figures vow to ‘use our voices’ to press for release of the beaten and detained singer-turned-politician Dozens of top musicians including Chris Martin, Chrissie Hynde, Brian Eno and Damon Albarn have signed an open letter calling for the release of detained Ugandan singer-turned-politician Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, known to fans as Bobi Wine.Kyagulanyi was charged in a military court in Uganda last week with unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition after being arrested in the north-western town of Arua following clashes during campaigning for a byelection. The politician’s driver was shot dead in the violence and Kyagulanyi’s arrest sparked two days of anti-government demonstrations. More than 80 artists, activists and politicians signed the statement condemning “the arrest, imprisonment and vicious, life-threatening physical attack by Ugandan government forces”.“We pledge to remain vigilant … and to use our voices … to press for his immediate and unconditional release, and for an end to this and other acts of political repression and violence in Uganda.”Signatories also include Peter Gabriel, Adam Clayton of U2, top African musicians such as Femi Kuti, Nigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka and Tom Watson, the deputy leader of the Labour party in the UK.The Ugandan government described the assault accusation as “rubbish”. President Yoweri Museveni, in power since 1986, has dismissed reports of injuries as “fake news”. Friends and relatives told the  that Kyagulanyi, who campaigns under the slogan “people power”, was left unable to stand after being beaten in detention.Medard Segona, a lawyer and politician representing Kyagulanyi, said: “He is in great pain. He can’t talk, he can’t walk, he sits with a lot of difficulty, his face is swollen and cannot see because of the torture. He couldn’t speak when the charges were read to him and I believe he didn’t know what was going or understood the charges read to him.”The singer was arrested on 13 August along with four other parliamentarians critical of Museveni on suspicion of involvement in the stoning of a presidential convoy during a parliamentary byelection campaign. Kyagulanyi was first charged on 16 August with treason, along with two other lawmakers and dozens of other people. The charges were later downgraded. He remains in a military facility in Kampala and the next hearing is scheduled for Thursday. Rights groups say opposition politicians, journalists and civil society organisations face systematic harassment in Uganda.Police have detained 68 people during two days of disturbances. Among them was a Reuters photographer, who has since been released from police detention. Footage broadcast by local station NTV showed people being struck with clubs and canes by men in uniform. Kyagulanyi’s detention has prompted anger across the region. A march by sympathisers is planned in Nairobi, Kenya, on Wednesday. The US, UK, EU and other powers have expressed their concern. Museveni, a key US security ally, has been elected five times. The last vote in 2016 was marred by allegations of fraud. The 74-year-old leader is now able to seek re-election in 2021 because parliament passed legislation last year removing a clause in the constitution that had prevented anyone over 75 from holding the presidency.Kyagulanyi, who was elected to parliament last year, has emerged as a powerful voice with his calls for young people to “stand up” and take over from a “failed leadership”. On his Twitter feed Kyagulanyi says he is “one Ghetto child who has something to say through music”.He has compared himself to France’s Emmanuel Macron and made no secret of his presidential ambitions. Many songs deal with social and political issues, calling for ordinary young people to act to improve their lives and their country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6159b71ad23dd7476b59752735e307bddb84e9b7/27_0_2685_1611/master/2685.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0a10db1c535b0f16a5b4c0d4c8aeb5f","title":"government to ban unethical puppy and kitten farms in england","story":"Measure will end commercial third-party sales and mean a new licensing regimeThe government is to ban unethical puppy and kitten farms in England, pledging to end the trade of unscrupulous breeders who keep animals in filthy and cramped conditions and force some to be pregnant many times over.The environment secretary, Michael Gove, announced on Wednesday that a ban on third-party puppy and kitten sales in England would be introduced. The regulation will mean anyone wanting to buy or home a puppy or kitten will have to deal directly with the breeder or rehoming centre. The proposed rule would also effectively prevent the sale of puppies and kittens in traditional pet shops.Breeders will only be able to sell puppies they have personally bred and online sellers will have to publish their licence number and the pet’s country of origin and country of residence.The scandal of puppy farms has come to light in recent years, with examples of unscrupulous dealers rearing hundreds of animals in cramped conditions with poor care, taking advantage of the high prices available from pet-owners, especially for sought-after breeds.Theresa May first spoke of an intended crackdown on “battery dogs” in December, in the wake of the Lucy’s Law campaign by a coalition of animal rights charities.Lucy’s Law campaign was named after a severely malnourished King Charles iel who was rescued from a breeding site. She had been forced to breed several times a year and her puppies were taken away after just four weeks – half the recommended time.Gove said the plans would tackle the early separation of puppies and kittens from their mothers, an act that could lead to serious health problems and lack of socialisation by the animals.“A ban on third-party sales will ensure the nation’s much loved pets get the right start in life,” he said. “People who have a complete disregard for pet welfare will no longer be able to profit from this miserable trade.”The government will consult this autumn on the proposed ban on third-party puppy and kitten sales in England. May previously said she had a personal stake in the new law, having owned puppies as a child – a poodle called Tassle and a mongrel named Lucky.The government is also bringing in harsher sentences of up to five years imprisonment for anyone convicted of animal abuse. Breeders will need a licence to sell three or more litters a year and anyone selling online will have to display a licence number.Marc Abraham, of PupAid, said irresponsible breeders in the UK and abroad used third parties to hide from buyers, who often bought dogs in good faith, having no idea of the conditions of the puppy’s birth. “By banning third-party sellers, Lucy’s Law will ensure all breeders are accountable, making it the first major step in tackling puppy farm cruelty,” he said.David Bowles, assistant director of public affairs at the RSPCA, said: “We believe it’s vital to crackdown on this underground trade to provide much needed protection to dogs and people, and welcome an end to the third-party sales of puppies.“Coupled with the new licensing regime and proper enforcement, we believe the new system will help ensure better health and welfare for dogs, and will better protect people from being duped by unscrupulous sellers.”Some called on the government to go further. Animal sanctuaries are not included in the new regulations, and currently sanctuaries, rescue and rehoming centres can be set up without oversight. Paula Boyden, veterinary director at Dogs Trust, said: “To be effective, a ban needs to be supported by some key additional measures, such as regulating rehoming organisations, which there is still time to introduce. This would close off other loopholes.”“Figures released to me under the Freedom of Information Act clearly show an extremely worrying picture across the country with the vast majority of animal rescue homes facing no regulation at all. From my encounters with many animal sanctuaries I know that nearly all of them hold high standards and only have the best interests of the animals they care for. However, these high standards should be imposed across the rescue sector.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49142432fe4f0e834de9392c4d5bae88c0adafe7/0_294_640_384/master/640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8955471d505ebab755a413f31031c031","title":"malaysia accused of state sponsored homophobia after lgbt crackdown","story":"Discrimination against community intensifies after politicians ratchet up anti-gay rhetoric to gain votesIn the early hours of Saturday, the police and government officials raided a small nightclub in Kuala Lumpur.The venue, Blue Boy, was known to be popular with the LGBT community, but for years had been relatively left alone by the authorities. Until the weekend. Twenty men were detained and ordered into counselling for “illicit behaviour” by the Federal Territory Islamic Religious Department of Malaysia (JAKIM).Government minister Khalid Samad later released a statement on the motivations behind the raid. “Hopefully this initiative can mitigate the LGBT culture from spreading into our society,” he said.It sent a clear signal to the LGBT community. Thilaga Sulathireh, co-founder of trans rights group Justice For Sisters, says: “We are under attack in an unprecedented way.” Just two days before the raid, a trans woman was brutally beaten on the street in Seremban while seven others watched. The attack left her with broken ribs, a broken backbone and a ruptured spleen.In the same week, a sharia court ordered a lesbian couple to be caned after they were caught having sex in a car, the first time in years such a punishment had been handed out in Malaysia. The judge said it was “a lesson and reminder to not just the two of you, but the members of society”.The general election in May has been celebrated for ushering in a new era, but the new government’s first 100 days in power have been marked by increased discrimination, harassment and violent hate crime against the LGBT community.Homosexuality is illegal in Malaysia, a Muslim-majority country, and there is no anti-discrimination law encompassing sexual orientation and gender identity. Thilaga says what she described as “state-sponsored homophobia and transphobia” has heightened the climate of fear and resulted in increased discrimination over the past three months.“We are also seeing a lot of shrinking spaces for LGBT people – offline, online, everywhere,” says Thilaga. “This level of aggression is new and the situation is becoming really alarming. We are hearing a lot of cases of people in the community feeling depressed and suicidal and not feeling safe using public facilities or even going out in public spaces.”The previous government led by Najib Razak was vocally homophobic and used sodomy laws to slander and lock up political opponent Anwar Ibrahim for almost a decade. Now in opposition, politicians including those associated with the Islamic party PAS, have amped up anti-LGBT rhetoric further.It is a tactic aimed at gaining popularity and putting the new government in a difficult political position, forcing them to clarify their stance on an issue seen as a poisoned chalice. Deputy prime minister Wan Azizah has said privately LGBT people should have equal rights so long as they keep their “practice” behind closed doors and do not “glamourise their lifestyle”.Others have been more forthright in their public condemnation. The minister for religious affairs, Mujahid Yusof Rawa, has said the government would “take proactive measures to curb the growing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender issues, and help them to return to the right path and lead a normal life”. The deputy minister for public affairs, Dr Lee Boon Chye, stated last week that LGBT people have an “organic disorder”.The first public victim of the push was Numan Afifi, who is gay and an LGBT rights activist. He was appointed press secretary to the minister of youth and sports in July but had to step down within days in response to an opposition campaign.“I always anticipated there would be some backlash to my appointment but I didn’t expect it to happen in the first week, and we weren’t prepared for how fierce it would be,” says Numan. “Trans women are now reporting to us they are being harassed by their employers, some were forced to cut their hair suddenly or dress differently.”Numan’s resignation was only the beginning. Also in July, authorities organised a seminar for 300 school counsellors, teachers and government officials which focused on ways to avert and “cure” LGBT behaviour. Then, in August, the minister for religious affairs ordered the portrait of two prominent LGBT rights activists, Nisha Ayub and Pang Khee Teik, to be removed from a public art exhibition. He also announced a regulator would be set up to monitor LGBT activity online. The opposition women’s minister said last week LGBT people should be banned from teaching in nursery schools, and a campaign to boycott businesses run by trans people is gaining momentum.Charles Santiago, a politician from the ruling coalition, has been one of the few to stand up for the community. “These are citizens of our country, they are part of the Malaysian family and they cannot be discriminated against,” he said.The campaign of hate, he said, “was likely to get worse”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/573d410a394ea84f3fe08740f3f91addf8403268/0_0_4560_2736/master/4560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02b19602876d420979274639bbc9e0be","title":"reunions of a lifetime as south koreans head north in pictures","story":"Almost 90 families have met for the first time since becoming separated by the Korean war nearly 70 years ago.

Then the carved pulpit, stained glass depicting the church’s patron, memorial plaques dedicated to long-dead rectors and young men lost in war, and dark, heavily polished pews.But in more and more Church of England parishes, those pews are falling out of favour with vicars, who, fretting about money, think the answer is to chuck out the benches – even ones past parishioners paid for...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeLoginChurch of EnglandPlease review our commenting policyComment: As the new host of Radio 1\u0026#39s Breakfast Show, Greg James bounces around like a puppy on ProzacDonald Trump in \u0026#39legal jeopardy\u0026#39: How the Manafort and Cohen cases could impact the presidentWomen say there\u0026#39s no such thing as too good looking - but it doesn\u0026#39t do for men to be too cleverDonald Trump defiant as former lawyer Cohen tells court he was told to break law\u0026#39Survival of the sluggish\u0026#39: Laziness could be good for human evolution, scientists suggestRussia investigation timeline: Robert Mueller and the probe into the Trump campaign\u0026#39s alleged collusionPresidential impeachment in the USA: How often has it happened?What happens if Donald Trump is impeached and who would be the next president?New treatment for ovarian cancer shows great promise, say scientistsPaul Manafort guilty of eight charges in fraud trialSwingers party ends in violence after man accuses participant of seducing his partnerNew GCSEs will reveal schools that unfairly help children get better results, private school chief saysCollapsed Hillsborough court case relied on conversation in the pub 30 years agoTake on more magistrates with criminal records to help improve ersity, law chief suggestsCruise ship survivor was complaining about her boyfriend after 10 hours in the sea, rescuers claimFirst World War brought to life in 3D colour by Lord of the Rings directorDonald Trump to spend 40 days campaigning for mid-term elections - more than Obama or BushBritish mountaineer in \u0026#39climb of generation\u0026#39 watched Russian attempt end in tragedy before himStowaway pigeon chicks found on HMS Queen Elizabeth flown back to Britain during maiden voyageWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2018/08/10/TELEMMGLPICT000171262612_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqhapkVlcy4J6MLIykjOByPukRrMoTfnQ2iiTVkrka1dk.jpeg?imwidth","title":"dominic raab michel barnier give update brexit talks","story":"Britain\u0026#39s Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Dominic Raab and European Union\u0026#39s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier Dominic Raab lashed out at “hair-raising scare stories” about a no deal Brexit at a press conference with Michel Barnier on Tuesday, as the EU’s chief negotiator warned that Brussels would not accept the blame for failure to strike an agreement.Britain’s new Brexit Secretary and Mr Barnier vowed to “negotiate continuously” to beat the looming deadline for Britain to leave the bloc, rather than rely on the now traditional rounds of negotiation.If the UK and the Brussels cannot finalise a Brexit deal before 29 March 2019, Britain will crash out of the EU without a deal, which Mr Barnier warned would be “the most costly form of Brexit”.  “We don’t want this option,” he added.To be very frank I do see a blame game starting against the EU in case of a no deal,” Mr Barnier told reporters at the European Commission in Brussels, as he warned it was unlikely there would be a deal before November.“The EU will not be impressed by a blame game and everyone should understand that.Britain’s new Brexit Secretary said that with “ambition, pragmatism and energy” a deal could be struck in time but he dismissed fears that failure could result in shortages of supplies such as medicines.He added, “our actions speak louder than words” as the two men revealed they would meet again next week in Brussels in a bid to overcome some of the sticking points preventing a deal. Chief among them remains how to avoid the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. Mr Barnier once again called on Britain to “dedramatize” the issue amid fears the EU plans to create a border between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland.Mr Barnier said he had no intention of shifting the EU\u0027s position in the negotiations, though Brexit-supporting politicians has claimed his  repeated refusals of Theresa May\u0027s proposals are pushing the UK towards a crash-out. Mr Barnier said that it was Britain which was leaving the EU and not the other way around. The principles of the EU in these negotiations are well known and have been consistent for the last two years, he said, We can find common ground based on the EU principles and on the other end the choices made by the UK. But Mr Barnier, who said negotiations were entering the final stage, said that the EU wanted an ambitious partnership with the UK that had “no precedent”.Mr Raab said: “I agree with Michel that we need to keep, as we climb the mountain, our eyes on the summit and accentuate the positives, and there are many positive areas where we agree, but of course we’ve got to close down those areas of disagreement.Concern about Brexit has usurped immigration, which peaked in 2015“I’m out here seeing Michel again, I shall be returning next week, we’re going to be picking up the intensity of negotiations, we agree on that.But of course the responsible thing for any government to do, and indeed on the EU side to do, is to make sure that we’re prepared for all eventualties.”In a later BBC interview, Mr Raab vowed Britain would move swiftly to secure the rights of EU citizens living in the UK if there was a no deal Brexit.Mr Raab’s predecessor David Davis did not visit Brussels at all for the first three months of this year. In stark contrast, Mr Raab has met EU officials three times in just  a month and will meet Mr Barnier again next week.Asked if he missed Mr Davis, who resigned in protest at the UK White Paper on customs, Mr Barnier said, “I am very happy to be working with Dominic”. Mr Raab added swiftly, I am very happy to be working with Michel.Last week the UK and EU held technical talks on the terms of the UK\u0027s departure from the bloc, including Ireland and the future trading relationship.  Talks will continue on Wednesday. Progress has so far been slow, leading Mr Barnier to signal that his October deadline to finalise the Brexit agreement, which would give national governments and the European Parliament five months to ratify the deal, was slipping.“I’m not going to say October. A Few days here or there, but certainly not later than the beginning of November, the EU’s chief negotiator said before warning that some parts of a British white paper on the future relationship were incompatible with the red lines he had been given by the EU-27.Please review our commenting policyComment: As the new host of Radio 1\u0026#39s Breakfast Show, Greg James bounces around like a puppy on ProzacDonald Trump in \u0026#39legal jeopardy\u0026#39: How the Manafort and Cohen cases could impact the presidentWomen say there\u0026#39s no such thing as too good looking -

preferably three times a day to make it unremarkable”, she said.“We set out that menopause should not be a women\u0027s only issue.”Dr Davies has also launched a menopause roadshow at the university and says workplaces need to become more menopause-friendly.Since trying to promote the conversation on menopause Dr Davies said male colleagues were keen to know more to support their family and female colleagues.She added: Confidence to talk about menopause is growing. We are removing the taboo - menopause is visible and in the everyday.Last year, the university became the first employer in the UK to introduce a menopause policy.Similar schemes have since been rolled out at the University of Manchester, Severn Trent Water and Nottinghamshire Police, as employers look to support older female colleagues.At a glance | The four types of menopauseIn February menopause cafes were launched as a meeting once every month giving colleagues a place to meet in an informal, social setting to allow male and female colleagues to discuss the menopause over a drink.Dr Davies said the cafes allow women and men to feel more confident about discussing the menopause.She said: People share tips on how they are managing menopause symptoms at work and at home.A recent share I really liked was to have a menopause book on the work desk. This is a place to write lists and say how her menopause was today.She wrote things herself but also encouraged her work colleagues to do the same. This has really helped her not to forget things - that can happen - if you experience intermittent forgetfulness, or what we call menopause brain fog.Words of wisdom: 8 celebrities on the menopauseIn the workplace symptoms which can be experienced include headaches, hot flushes, depression and excessive tiredness.There are around 4.3 million working women aged 50 or over - the biggest increase in employment rates since 1994.The menopause occurs at the age of 51 years on average, so many women now undergo the change at work.On average, most symptoms last about four years from the last period.However, about one in every 10 women experiences them for up to 12 years.A report by the Government Equalities Office released in 2017 recommended that employers provide desk fans to help menopausal women manage their symptoms.They should also provide cold water fountains, places to rest, special absence policies and ensure uniforms are made from non-synthetic materials.Please review our commenting policyComment: As the new host of Radio 1\u0026#39s Breakfast Show, Greg James bounces around like a puppy on ProzacDonald Trump in \u0026#39legal jeopardy\u0026#39: How the Manafort and Cohen cases could impact the presidentWomen say there\u0026#39s no such thing as too good looking -

Over the weekend, CCTV\u0026nbspsaid that on 9 August alone, Apple removed 4,000 apps from its App Store.Zhu Xi, deputy director of the Centre for Communication Law Studies at China University of Political Science and Law, said that\u0026nbspalthough Apple removed the apps, people who had already installed them would still be able to use them in China.Apple should shut down and punish this related account of the offender within the control of Apple, Mr Xi told CCTV.\u0026nbspTeenager hoping to work for Apple hacked into the company\u0027s networkIf there is no shutdown, it means that the app is only removed from the platform, and the offender can continue to operate the app.Apple has previously removed hundreds of virtual private network (VPN) apps from its online store in China, which allow\u0026nbsppeople to bypass China\u0027s strict internet\u0026nbspcensorship rules that block sites like Google and Facebook.The Cupertino-based company attempted to justify this decision in 2017 by claiming its presence in China was ultimately beneficial to the country\u0027s citizens.We believe that our presence in China helps promote greater openness and facilitates the free flow of ideas and information, Apple\u0027s vice president of public policy Cynthia Hogan said at the time.\u0026nbspOur products and services offer our customers opportunities to communicate in many forms, including through personal communications services, podcasts, photos, and millions of apps.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/10/21/18/web-gcse-pa.jpg","title":"gcse results day 2018 off rolling school exclusions teachers exams ofsted","story":"Created with Sketch.Two-thirds of respondents were aware of the practice taking placeClick to followThe IndependentMore than one in five teachers say schools get rid of pupils to boost exam resultsMore than fifth of teachers have witnessed school pupils being effectively excluded through the back door in a bid to boost exam results, a new survey has revealed.In total, 21 per cent\u0026nbspsaid they had\u0026nbspseen “off-rolling” occur at their school.\u0026nbspThe practice\u0026nbspsees students taken off the register using\u0026nbspinformal exclusions,\u0026nbspto ensure results are not brought down.The survey of teachers was carried out for schools watchdog\u0026nbspOfsted\u0026nbspby the well known pollsters YouGov.\u0026nbspThe findings were released\u0026nbspas tens of thousands of students are set to receive their\u0026nbspGCSE results\u0026nbsplater this week.\u0026nbspMinisters have previously spoken out against the practice which has become a growing concern for Ofsted,\u0026nbspamid claims that schools are playing the system to improve their league table position.The survey, of more than 1,000 teachers, found that 11 per cent had seen off-rolling in their current school and another 10 per cent said it had happened at one of their former schools.Meanwhile, 45 per cent of teachers said they had heard of it happening in the system – meaning that two-thirds of the teachers surveyed were aware of the practice taking place.\u0026nbspLast month, the Commons Education Select Committee warned an increasing number of students were being “abandoned” by the schools system due to a rise in formal exclusions and off-rolling.Education secretary Damian Hinds later condemned the practice saying that he heard “many stories” of schools using informal exclusions to get rid of pupils with special educational needs (SEN).A recent report\u0026nbspby the FFT Education Datalab\u0026nbspresearch company found that thousands of children in England are missing from official education statistics after they were removed from schools before they sat their GCSEs.Researchers called for school league tables to be weighted to take into account the amount of time a child had spent at each school to reduce the practice.UK news in picturesFamilies enjoy rides on the dodgems during an Eid in the Park celebration marking Eid Al-Adha at the New River Sports ground in Wood Green, London.

Any decision to exclude a pupil should be reasonable and fair, and permanent exclusion should only ever be used as a last resort. Our statutory guidance for schools is clear that they must consider the underlying causes of poor behaviour before excluding a pupil.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/21/13/winona-ryder-keanu-reeves.jpg","title":"keanu reeves winona ryder married dracula wedding francis ford coppola","story":"Created with Sketch.The director led the duo in a \u0027real marriage scene\u0027 as part of the 1992 filmClick to followThe Independent CultureFrancis Ford Coppola has corroborated the long-standing theory that Winona Ryder married Keanu Reeves on the set of a film he directed in 1992. \u0026nbspThe filmmaker led the duo in a wedding scene on the set of Bram Stoker’s Dracula which Ryder previously said she believes was legally binding.

It was a fairly low-key event, with a portable stage not much bigger than the park’s bandstand. The lineup was comprised of mainly tribute acts.Fast forward to 2018, and Bingley Music Live, as the event evolved into, is preparing for its biggest three-day festival yet, on the weekend of Friday 31 August. This time the roster is a little more impressive: Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Jake Bugg, Public Image Ltd, Shed Seven, former Spice Girl Melanie C… and all on a stage that wouldn’t be out of place at one of the summer’s big-name festivals.But, so what? Festivals are big business in the UK, and the summer calendar is stuffed with internationally-renowned acts zipping between fields across the country. Just down the road from Bradford, the Leeds Festival is twinned with its more venerable cousin Reading, and together they form the apex of the festival pyramid with old-stager Glastonbury (when it’s not having a fallow year, like this summer).But also on the calendar is Latitude, the Isle of Wight Festival, RiZE (formerly the V Festival), Wireless, Creamfields, BBC Music’s Big Weekend, Bestival… it seems that no matter where you are in the country, sling a 12in picture disc like a frisbee any time over the summer and you’re almost certain to hit a music superstar on the head.But what makes Bingley Music Live a slightly different beast is that just like the inaugural Music at Myrtle\u0026nbspevent in 1991, it is still run by the local authority. No longer free, of course, because you don’t get Noel Gallagher out of bed on the sort of money you can make up by adding a few quid on the council tax bills. But value for money certainly, compared to the big commercial festivals, and certainly pulling its weight in the ring with many of them.A spokesperson for Bradford Council said\u0026nbspthat when Music at Myrtle was set up in 1991, nobody really expected that it would become the major player it is now. She says:\u0026nbsp“When we held our first small free concert few could have envisaged that the festival would grow to attract such big names as Pet Shop Boys, Kaiser Chiefs, Manic Street Preachers, Chic and Nile Rogers, All Saints, Jess Glynne\u0026nbspand James who have all played over recent years.”The key, though, is that Bingley Music Live has grown organically. Bradford Council never set out to make a full-blown festival, it expanded a little bit year by year. She adds:\u0026nbsp“Although it has come a long way from its humble beginnings and it is unusual for a council to be involved in such a big festival we have grown it gradually and now it sees 15,000 people a day flock to the town for festival weekend.”\u0026nbspIn its early years, Music at Myrtle was split into themed days, with old rockers such as Bradford’s own Smokie on the bill, newer bands for the younger audience, and jazz. In 1998 Bradford Council partnered with local radio station Pulse to make the event a two-day festival, with Pulse using their clout and contacts book to bring in bigger names such as Liberty X, McFly, Rachel Stevens and another Bradford boy-done-good, Gareth Gates.That continued into the 2000s, until what was then billed as the Party in the Park hit its first major bump in the road. In February 2007, the event was summarily cancelled. Rising costs and declining audiences were blamed, and the Pulse’s station director, Tony Wilkinson, told the local paper,\u0026nbsp and\u0026nbspArgus, that support from the music industry for such small festivals was on the wane. He said that the record labels did not have “as many artists out on promotional tours to provide a top class running order”.Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo ParkWhat nobody envisaged in 2007, though, was that the music industry was in the throes of a massive shakeup. Downloading and streaming of music was in its infancy then, and music acts still made the majority of their money from physical album and single sales. However, a decade on, that situation is reversed nowadays it’s the touring of live shows and pounding the festival beat that earns pop and rock bands a crust.It would be nice to think that Bradford Council was playing something of a blinder back in 2007, but the chances are that it was pure serendipity. Either way, within a couple of months of the announcement that the Myrtle Park festival was dead, it rose from the ashes.The original plan was to scale back on the A-listers and give more of a platform to unknown, local bands. The rescue package had been put together wholly by Bradford Council, and they were obviously mindful of the budgetary restrictions of putting on a big festival but still wanting to provide residents with a music event of some description.Indeed, it was the residents of Bingley in particular who lobbied the council to save the festival in some form. This was at a time when the financial crisis was just bubbling over, and it’s fair to say that Bradford had been hit harder than most cities. Neighbouring Leeds had stolen a march on city centre development and by the mid-2000s had a thriving retail and leisure sector that put it in a stronger position to weather the credit crunch.aren’t too far removed from its neighbouring Leeds\u0026nbspBefore the financial collapse, Bradford had been on the up as well. Large swathes of the city centre had been demolished to make way for a brand new shopping centre built by Westfield. The majority of the work on taking down the tired, old buildings began in 2004, but by 2007 everything had stalled, leaving Bradford with an infamous hole in the ground that made it look as though it was ground zero of a meteor strike. It wasn’t until 2015 that the centre was completed and opened… and, to be fair, did help to kickstart a much-needed revitalisation of Bradford.So it was understandable in that atmosphere in 2007 that people wanted some form of entertainment, and Bingley Music Live was it. That year’s festival was indeed\u0026nbsppared down, but still attracted some recognisable names – Bruce Foxton’s post-Paul Weller “From The Jam” outfit, the Charlatans, the Bluetones. The following year brought the Happy Mondays, Echo and the Bunnymen, and local heroes Terrorvision.\u0026nbspBy the time the first headliners the Charlatans returned in 2012, the festival had added a third day on the Friday, and the festival was really on an upward curve.But can a local authority really justify the cost? There are partners of course, including Ticketline, Mercure Hotels and Carlsberg. But surely it doesn’t make any money?According to a Bradford Council reply to a freedom of information request last month asking for income and expenditure on Bingley Music Live over the past three years, in 2015 there was income of £946,000 against just over £1m in costs. In 2016 income was down at £822,000 against very similar costs, but last year, with costs standing at £1.15m, there was gross income of £1.3m… leaving a net surplus of £222,000.Having attended the event last year, those figure’s aren’t surprising. It was packed and money was flowing over the bars and food concessions. It’s also a very family-oriented event. And with ticket sales ensuring 15,000 come through the gates every day this year –\u0026nbspwhich the coup of booking Noel Gallagher has certainly helped with –\u0026nbspit looks likely that Bingley Music Live is on an upward trend.Being in the middle of one of the Bradford district’s big towns as well, rather than in splendid isolation on a field somewhere in Hampshire, there are extra benefits. My council spokesperson says: “The event is a big thing for Bingley’s businesses, with its many excellent pubs, bars, shops and places to eat all busy with people for the full weekend. The festival is also embraced by the local Bradford and Bingley Sports Club who provide camping for festivalgoers on their fields.”Ariana Grande and James Corden perform hit-filled version of TitanicWhy drag queen Vicky Vox is starring in Little Shop of HorrorsCamp Bestival forced to close early due to poor weather conditionsWhile Bingley Music Live might be unusual in being local authority-run, its model of being an “urban festival” is one that is becoming increasingly popular… and can pay idends for local economies.Journalist Claude Lynch, writing in CityMetric earlier this year, said that while the big, camp-out-all-weekend festivals were declining, smaller, urban festivals were thriving… and possibly because of a sense of community. He wrote: “Multiple studies into the dynamics and economics of festivals make similar arguments about how to drive ‘re-patronising’ – in other words, how to make festivalgoers want to come back next year. Evidence suggests that ‘social identification’ – having something in common with other festivalgoers – is often just as important as the quality of the music or the food. Festivals can capitalise on this boon of social identification by offering a self-contained event designed\u0026nbspwith both locals and tourists in mind. Locals are more likely to patronise events that emphasise community spirit while tourists are enthused by events that symbolise and epitomise the local culture.”From very humble beginnings 27 years ago, Bingley Music Live has survived and thrived, often against the odds, and when international superstar Noel Gallagher takes the stage in a couple of weeks’ time, it will be the culmination of the dogged determination that gets things done in this part of the world… and looks like providing the template for the future of live music.For more information go to bingleymusicliveMusic at MyrtleEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Despite its small size, the festival has attracted larger, mainstream acts such as Maximo Park"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/16/madonna-career-21.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6463721  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 1984  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/14/16/madonna-career-21.jpg","title":"madonna 60 pop stars middle age patti smith kate bush","story":"Created with Sketch.In most\u0026nbspprofessions,\u0026nbspwomen of a certain age are invisible.

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe IndependentSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/21/21/gettyimages-960196614.jpg","title":"post malone plane emergency landing update twitter new jersey airport nyc","story":"Created with Sketch.Two of the plane\u0027s wheels blew out during takeoff\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent CulturePost Malone confirms he is safe after emergency plane landing (Getty)Musicians Post Malone and Andrew Watt have safely landed after the plane they were on was forced to make an emergency landing.The pair were aboard a Gulfstream plane headed to the UK from New Jersey’s Teterboro Airport when the plane began to malfunction during takeoff.The rapper and Watt were among 14 other passengers aboard when two of the private jet\u0027s left tyres blew out.After the pilot realised what had happened, he prepared for an emergency landing - burning off fuel\u0026nbspas he headed for Westfield Barnes Regional Airport in Springfield, Massachusetts before erting and landing safely at Stewart International Airport in New Windsor, New York.Malone, 23, whose real name is Austin Post, confirmed his safety on Twitter, where he also responded to those who had wished him harm.“I landed guys.

Neither those 74, or the unknown number\u0026nbspwho were removed after being convicted of a crime, are among those who will receive an apology.Of the 83\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspcitizens the Home Office now says it removed from the UK, 31 were detained beforehand, either at an immigration removal centre or a port.A further 81 people\u0026nbspthought to be Windrush citizens\u0026nbspwere detained but not deported.Details of all 164 Windrush\u0026nbspcitizens have now been passed to\u0026nbspa special taskforce who have started contacting\u0026nbspthem, the home secretary said.Mr Javid said in the letter: “It is clear from our internal analysis of these that features of inidual cases are markedly different.“The way in which each inidual was treated by the department, and the degree of detriment suffered, varied considerably.”In 18 of the cases\u0026nbsprecords suggested\u0026nbspthey were detained or deported specifically because they could not demonstrate\u0026nbspcontinuous residence in the UK.In a statement, Mr\u0026nbspJavid\u0026nbspsaid: “The experiences faced by some members of the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspgeneration are completely unacceptable and I am committed to righting the wrongs of the past.Home Office tells destitute Windrush woman to seek charity helpThe Windrush gagging order scandal will continue to haunt the Tories“I would like to personally apologise to those identified in our review and am committed to providing them with the support and compensation they deserve.“We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again – which is why I have asked an independent adviser to look at what lessons we can learn from\u0026nbspWindrush.”Another report\u0026nbspby the influential group in July criticised the Home Office for failing to provide full figures about the number of Windrush\u0026nbspcitizens affected by the scandal.It said the Home Office must undergo total reform, warning that unless the department was overhauled the scandal “will happen again\u0026nbspfor another group of people”.The Home\u0026nbspOffice taskforce\u0026nbspreceived 6,507 enquiries from possible Windrush cases between April –\u0026nbspwhen it opened a call centre – and July, the letter to the Home Affairs Committee chair revealed.Yet only 3,585 people had been given documentation confirming their status by last month –\u0026nbsp2,272 under initial arrangements and 1,465 under the government’s formal Windrush scheme.

But the European Union is not going to be impressed by that kind of blame game, everyone should understand that.“On the first day of the first press conference I came before you as a negotiator,\u0026nbspI said Brexit will have numerous consequences –\u0026nbsphuman, social consequences, economic, financial, technical, legal –\u0026nbspand I said that many people had underestimated those consequences.”Mr Barnier’s warning comes as the EU and UK both pledge to intensify negotiations, with both sides wanting to reach a deal by October.\u0026nbspMr Raab, who visited Brussels on Tuesday, said he wanted to “step up the intensity of talks” and said there were still issues to resolve on Northern Ireland and the future relationship. He added that those issues must be dealt with at a “political” level.He also said the UK was committed to leaving the EU in March next year even if it was with\u0026nbspno deal.Brexit will have numerous consequences: human, social consequences, economic, financial, technical, legal, and I said that many people had underestimated those consequences“Some of these hair-raising scare stories are very far from the truth,” he said, adding that he would set out more details about preparations for no deal on Thursday.Responding to whether the UK would reconsider its decision to quit the block in the event no agreement is reached, he said: “Certainly on the UK side, no. We’ll be leaving in March of next year.”There has been barely any movement in talks over the summer as both sides say each others’ plans for the Northern Ireland border and the future trade relationship are unacceptable.Continuing political uncertainty in the UK is also a major roadblock to a proper deal, with Theresa May’s Chequers plan opposed by many within her own party. The EU has said dismissed the plan as unworkable in several significant ways.Both sides have little room for manoeuvre\u0026nbspto change their positions, however: Ms May appears to believe she has already given more concessions to the EU than her party will allow her, while the\u0026nbspEuropean Commission negotiators have their mandate set by the EU27\u0026nbspnations, who say they are not prepared to change the nature of their union\u0026nbspto accommodate\u0026nbspBritain’s departure.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

The laws\u0026nbspwould have helped the country meet its obligations under the Paris climate agreement.But after rebel Liberal Party MPs led by former prime minister Tony Abbott threatened to vote against the legislation – which would have triggered a crisis of confidence in Mr Turnbull – the PM decided to back down.As Greece burns, the Tories are signing off a laughable fracking billGlobal temperatures to be ‘abnormally high’ for at least four years2018 will be fourth-hottest year on record, climate scientists predictDealing with climate change by geoengineering Earth ‘would not work’It was Mr Abbott himself who signed Australia up to the Paris climate agreement, and it was he who at the time announced the\u0026nbspemissions reductions target of\u0026nbsp26\u0026nbspper cent from 2005 levels.In 2014 he even said Australia could reduce emissions by up to 28 per cent, saying:\u0026nbsp“There’s a definite commitment to 26 per cent\u0026nbspbut we believe under the policies that we’ve got, with the circumstances that we think will apply, that we can go up to 28 per cent.”Despite the boast, he was later reported to have told colleagues he was “misled” while in Paris, and recently argued that using energy policy as a means of reducing emissions is “madness”.\u0026nbsp“In politics you have to focus on what you can deliver,” Mr Turnbull said on Monday, adding the legislation would not pass parliament if it contained an emissions target.“Cheaper power has always been our number one priority when it comes to energy policy,” he told reporters.Mr Abbott has reportedly thrown his support behind Peter\u0026nbspDutton, Australia’s home affairs minister, for a possible leadership challenge, though Mr Turnbull said he had the support of his party colleagues including Mr Dutton.Efforts to introduce climate change combatting emissions targets have repeatedly frustrated Australian politicians.In 2007 Kevin Rudd famously declared climate change “the great moral issue of our generation”, but was unable to push through the changes he wanted while PM, eventually dropping them. His Labour party successor, Julia Gillard, faced an aggressive campaign led by Mr Abbott against her plans to reduce pollution, in which she was called a liar and was personally derided by conservative campaigners.MPs his government has dropped plans to put an emissions reduction target into legislation (EPA)The current debate over the impact of energy policy on climate change has seen even greater polarisation.Mr Turnbull’s failure to win support for the emissions target, comes despite a recent history of worsening wildfires and searing temperatures. The bushfire season has typically begun during the country’s summer months, but Australia’s increasingly hotter, drier weather has seen the season brought two months earlier – well into winter.Meanwhile, in January this year, Penrith, 30 miles west of Sydney, was the hottest place on earth, hitting 47.3C, while Sydney was 44C.10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn\u0027t believe in climate changeA group of emperor penguins face a crack in the sea ice, near McMurdo Station, AntarcticaAmid a flood in Islampur, Jamalpur, Bangladesh, a woman on a raft searches for somewhere dry to take shelter.

He said a number of hair-raising stories are far from the truth, adding: The overriding focus is trying our best to get a good deal for the UK and EU.He also confirmed the UK will be leaving on March 29, 2019 regardless of having a deal or not.\u0026nbsp                Fox suggest \u0027tens of thousands\u0027 migration target could be SCRAPPED                EU warned: Expert lists steps that will lead to bloc DISINTEGRATIONMr Raab said: We will be leaving in March of next year and will be prepared for all eventualities for the negotations.

Hot temperatures are not uncommon in Britain during summer, but usually, it is mixed in with cooler and wetter days as unsettled weather fronts move in from the Atlantic.This is because the jet stream - strong winds high in the sky from west to east - shift about. If it is north of the UK and Ireland then hot weather can result. If it moves down over the country, that means low-pressure systems (wet and mild) are sucked our way. But this summer the jet stream has been jammed to the north of the UK and Ireland.This creates the conditions for high pressure to develop - and that means hot and dry weather.As August began this year, a dangerously hot African plume began to make its way across Iberia.While many Brits get uncomfortable working in 30C heats and commuting on sweaty tubes - our summers are still relatively mild compared to others.In North Africa and the Middle East temperatures regularly exceed 50C in the summer. Sudan in East Africa is one of the hottest places on Earth, with temperatures of more than 55C and very little rain a feature of life in a country horribly blighted by war and poverty.  Previous reports suggested Britain could bask in a 30C heatwave until October but, for this bank holiday, it looks unlikely to be a scorcher.Forecasts for that day point to a typically British mix of sunshine and showers for many across Britain.A North/South split will roughly divide the country — with more rain and wind in the North and sunnier spells in the South.This will be the case throughout the long weekend as parts of the North West especially face heavy showers at times.Even torrents of hail will thrash northern areas including Scotland, the North of England, Northern Wales and Northern Ireland during unsettled weekend conditions.High temperatures will struggle to get above the mid-teens Celsius.Further South will see more settled weather with lighter winds and longer stretches of sunshine.But it will still be cooler, with temperatures hovering around 19C to 20C from Saturday to Monday in the South East.The UK has been experiencing hot weather since April. But the last summer heatwave began on June 23 and lasted all July. A few days of rain in August didnt do much to restore green to grass in the south of England, with lawns and parks still looking rather brown and frazzled. The UK could be about to record its hottest summer ever, eclipsing the legendary heatwave of 1976.The Met Office have just released interim figures which suggest the summer of 2018 - the months of June, July and August - will enter the record books for one reason or another.Twelve years ago, Britain recorded its warmest summer since records began in 1910, if you use the calculation of the ‘mean’ temperature, a combination of the day-time and night-time highs.In 2006, the mean temperature at this stage in the summer was 16.1C (61F), exactly the same as it is now.The final figure for 2006 was 15.8C (60F), which means if we continue at the same rate until the end of this month, a new record will have been established."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004254601242.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"young women getting 99 botox","story":"After all, in the era of Love Island and social media, we’re all potential celebrities now. Even those of us who will never hit the big time have an Instagram audience waiting to “like” our every selfie.So this is just the logical next step towards making cosmetic surgery available to the masses, rather than the few.Some have argued that Superdrug Botox is actually a good thing, because it bridges the gap between the elite Harley Street options — where you pay several hundred pounds for an appointment with an “aesthetic doctor” — and the more backstreet treatments carried out by hairdressers with just a few hours of training.I disagree. Being able to buy a syringe or two of Botox when you are out shopping for your hairspray legitimises — and normalises — the act of injecting poison in your skin in the name of beauty.Being able to buy Botox over the counter, so to speak, makes it seem like no big deal — just another tick in the “maintenance” box, and as reasonable as tinting your lashes or getting your ears pierced.And that is the problem. All decisions we make about our appearance boil down to personal choice. And if it makes someone feel better to tinker cosmetically or surgically with their natural looks, that’s their choice. No one should judge them for it.But there is a wider problem.Increasingly, women think that whatever they look like naturally isn’t good enough. More and more, the “solution” is invasive cosmetic enhancement.A mainstream shop making Botox available for less than 100 quid is surely only going to add to the pressure some women feel to change their appearance using more than just make-up.Superdrug presents itself as responsible because it will refuse to treat under-25s, when other clinics will.That is shocking — not so much that some clinics WILL treat under-25s but that anyone so young could think they need Botox.You can’t blame Superdrug for this epidemic. It is simple supply and demand.The question is: Why the growing desire among women to look frozen?It’s not like you can get away with saying you’ve not had it when you have, because it’s so obvious.I’ve got a friend whose husband jokes that she needs to hold up little signs saying “happy” or “angry” when she feels an emotion, since her face is so paralysed by botulism.While I’m a big believer in your body, your choice, I’m also a believer in scratching the right itch.The truth is if you feel good about yourself, you look good. If you feel bad and lack confidence, nothing, no amount of Botox or fillers, will ever change that.Just look at Meg from Love Island, above, who, even after an estimated £40,000 worth of plastic surgery, is still massively insecure.Because it’s not what’s on the outside that counts, it’s what’s on the inside.The problem is our society tends to give far too much weight to the outside. That is especially the case for women, but increasingly for men, too.I realise all of this is easy to say, harder to act on. I’m as susceptible as the next person to comparing myself with ­others more beautiful — and possibly more airbrushed — and finding myself lacking.I’m just glad that, when that happens, I know the thing that will make me feel better is far more likely to be self-acceptance than Botox.After all, if you tighten a prune you don’t get a grape — you just get a tight prune!So the really big question is, how to achieve self-acceptance when we are surrounded by all these images of perfection?Well, we are all on our own journey with that one but I’ve got some suggestions which might help.The first is to focus on what you have, rather than what you don’t. And the second is to never, ever compare yourself to anyone else.Forget Botox, you can have that advice for free.You’re welcome.We all enjoyed cheering on the Three Lions players that would quickly become our heroes during the World Cup in Russia this summer.Sadly, those heady days are over and we were reminded of the seamier side of sport this week with the arrest of England rugby union ace Danny Cipriani.His embarrassing brawl outside a Jersey nightclub came hot on the heels of England cricket’s Ben Stokes’ trial over his clash with two men during a night out.Stokes was cleared, but what links these sorry sagas is our drinking culture, which dictates that consuming excessive amounts of alcohol is a normal way of letting off steam.Sportsmen are supposed to be role models, as they influence young people and need to keep themselves in good physical shape.But as long as we think it is OK to binge and push our bodies to the limits rather than sip a few drinks, then violence, injuries and stupid mistakes will continue to be a regular feature of our nights out.And if you are an England sports star, then public shame is just one of the tragic consequences – along with the end of your career – that you might have to face.Why should anyone be surprised at the news that sexual harassment in the police force is rife?Let’s face it, it happens everywhere. So why should the police be any exception?I thought they might hold themselves to higher standards. But no.A new survey reveals that dirty jokes, inappropriate touching, leering and being pressured to have sex are daily issues for many police staff.In a survey of almost 1,800 police staff in England, Wales and Scotland, half had heard sexualised jokes and one in five had received a sexually explicit email or text from a colleague.Shockingly, one in five had also been touched in a way that made them feel uncomfortable.Our head of police at West Ham is a woman.She is smart, tough, brave and would never put up with this type of behaviour.Part of the problem is that many women accept these actions as “normal” and don’t even know how to object. We must learn to stop putting up with it.But it is much more important that men learn what is OK and what is not.End of.Jacinda Ardern – the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who has continued to work since becoming a mother in June – was criticised this week for “using her baby as a prop” after she was seen breastfeeding her daughter at a public meeting.I guess whoever coined that phrase has never had the experience of looking after a baby who needs to be fed – right NOW.Nor will they have dealt with the very loud consequences of that failing to happen.Instead, what about congratulating Jacinda on doing such a great job of being a working mum?We said farewell to two legends last week, let’s remember them with this wonderful meme....So interesting that the day after A-level results arrived, more than 26,000 university places were still available.An Ipsos Mori poll found that while most students still think university is “important”, that is down from 86 per cent five years ago to 75 per cent now.Since a degree is expensive – and no guarantee of a job – you can see why people are questioning the validity of one.However, there is no viable alternative.There are just 10,000 degree-level apprenticeships available, compared with 300,000 university places, according to Sir Peter Lampl, of the Sutton Trust.We need to think how we prepare young people for work and we need more technical qualifications at degree level that offer the chance of a bright future.GOT a story?

The public are wise to it.Our poll makes it clear that fudging Brexit would unleash serious anger among the electorate. The Government should take notice.Almost half of voters already reckon that the political classes in Britain are making heavy weather of Brexit, in the vain and misguided belief that they can get the public to change their mind.Meanwhile, the drop in support for Theresa May in the polls and Ukip’s rise is a further indication of what the public thought of her Chequers proposals.Millions more will abandon the Tories if Brexit ends up being fudged.Remoaners and Brussels have done their best since the Leave vote to make us think we made a terrible mistake and that the cards are stacked in the EU’s favour.Well, today’s poll is clear. We didn’t and they’re not.DEFENCE Secretary Gavin Williamson was right to stand up to France after they tried to bill us £2million for helping them stamp out a jihadi insurrection in Mali.Mr Williamson reportedly threatened to ground our choppers in retaliation.

No more!”IT is scandalous that cops in the capital are reliant on weapon-detecting equipment donated by the public.Knife crime is the most deadly threat our youngsters face on the streets today.This week two men were killed and four teenagers stabbed in separate incidents.How can we expect cops to stamp out this deadly crimewave if they are reliant on public donations?The Government needs to properly start tackling this crisis. Lives depend on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is whether the PM herself will seize the initiative and signal her own plan to jump before she is pushed.The undeclared contest has transformed Britain’s negotiating stance — from Theresa May’s meek, slow-motion surrender to a strident demand for a decent, honourable settlement. The good news is that while MPs have been away on holiday, Brussels has begun to blink.At long last it has dawned on our EU neighbours that they have more to lose from a messy Brexit than we do.Forfeiting the UK’s £40billion ransom payment — plus our annual £12billion contribution — would instantly cripple the EU expansionary budget plans and plunge poorer nations such as Greece into crisis.Car and pharmaceutical giants, not to mention French farmers, who export vast stocks to the UK, would be plunged into crisis. Cooperation on crime, security and defence would be at risk. Governments across Europe are now piling pressure on Brussels to see sense.Tory leadership wannabes have sniffed the way the wind is blowing.The Tories won’t pick another Remainer as party leader. Nor does this Government have a prayer at the next election unless it can see off Nigel Farage and his Ukip insurgents with a deal that satisfies the 52 per cent who voted Leave.This explains a sudden enthusiasm at the top for stating the blindingly obvious: Britain will survive a clean Brexit, while an obstructive Brussels will be diminished.After two years of being bossed around by EU bully Michel Barnier, senior Cabinet ministers are coming out as born-again Eurosceptics. Foreign Secretary and repentant Remainer Jeremy Hunt admits Britain will experience some turbulence, but says the EU will be damaged “for a generation”.His warning is echoed by Brexit supremo Dominic Raab, who has rubbished “Project Fear” stories about food and medicine shortages.While loyally insisting a deal is “still the most likely outcome”, Mr Raab insists Britain will cope with the alternative.Hunt and Raab are now openly jockeying for the top job — along with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Treasury chief Liz Truss and a host of others.Significantly, Michael Gove seems out of the race after endorsing Mrs May’s Chequers sellout. So where does this leave Boris Johnson? If tens of thousands of grass- roots Tory supporters have anything to do with it, he would be way out in front. As things stand, they don’t.BoJo is out of office and fighting confected outrage over Muslim face masks. Enemies such as the priestly Dominic Grieve threaten to quit the party if he is elected.Under present rules, Boris needs enough support from fellow MPs to be one of the two candidates submitted to party members for a final verdict. His rivals will do anything to stop him — which is why party activists are demanding rule changes to allow any MP with 20 votes to enter the final ballot.Boris has gone quiet — but not for long. He is reportedly planning a nationwide tour — complete with bright-red battle bus — trashing Mrs May’s Chequers deal and calling for a clean Brexit.There will be plenty of opportunities for car-crash interviews and zipwire-style TV images. But the bookies aren’t the only ones making BoJo the clear favourite as Britain’s next Prime Minister.He names Somalis, Ethiopians, North and Central Africans and Afghans as being responsible for the knife-gang slaughter of young black and Asian men.“Race is part of the picture,” says the equality campaigner. “Failing to point this out impedes the fight against these crimes and imperils yet more children of colour.”He is right, isn’t he?But how long before this decent black man is himself accused of racism for daring to tell this unvarnished truth?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s about attacking Jews.”Stephen Pollard told The Sun: “The recommendation that activists who want to rid Parliament of Zionists use the Jewish Chronicle for a hit-list of targets exposes the truth: that they use the word Zionist as a euphemism for Jew.A Labour Party spokesman said: “We don’t comment on staffing matters.”The latest anti-semitism howler came as Mr Corbyn claimed he “could not remember” if he had shared a takeaway with bloodthirsty boss of Hamas following The Sun’s revelations that he had bragged about it.Despite recounting the long dinner in a 2010 column for the communist Morning Star newspaper, yesterday Mr Corbyn told reporters A takeaway dinner? I dont remember any takeaway dinners.I have met many people from many aspects of the Palestinian cause as a way of bringing about dialogue, as a way of bringing about peace.During a visit to Scotland, the veteran lefty was also probed about comments made by former Labour MP Jim Sheridan who said he had lost “respect and empathy” for Jews because of the antisemitism crisis.Mr Corbyn said: Its completely wrong what he said. He did withdraw it later on, he has been suspended from membership, there will be an independent investigation - independent of me that is - so I cant comment any further.

Will our current free movement regime be rebadged as a “Labour Mobility Framework”?Such a move, speculated on in the media this week, would be politically toxic and very poorly timed. It would also betray her own instincts, which she rightly gave voice to when she became Prime Minister.Striking a chord with millions of people angry and alienated at their voices being ignored by the political elite on immigration and the downside of globalisation, delivered for her record poll ratings then and a real feeling of hope that at last people in power were listening.Yes, the main driver for the Leave vote was about democracy, independence and national sovereignty but it was also about the fundamental choice that a UK outside the EU would have: Who comes to our country and on what basis – decided by our own Parliament.Voters have noticed that the tightening of the labour market and record employment levels, as revealed by the Office for National Statistics last week, mean that at long last real wages – i.e. pay packets less inflation – are slowly rising and that belatedly big business is beginning to move away from an over reliance on cheap foreign labour, undercutting the pay and conditions of indigenous workers and giving rise to higher welfare dependency.It might seem a radical concept, but such employers might just have to pay workers decent wages, train them better, improve their skills and try hard to retain them. That’s why EU workers are still coming to the UK in huge numbers, despite ridiculous Project Fear stories to the contrary.So yes – Brexit will mean higher pay for British workers! Top businessman Stuart Rose, briefly spokesman for the Remain campaign, accurately predicted such a development before the EU Referendum.Regrettably, the multinationals’ trades union, the CBI didn’t get the message: No surprise that they now want no restrictions on foreign workers post Brexit – in other words an endless pool of cheap labour just like now.Likewise, they’re happy to defend the growing gap between average pay and that of FTSE 100 bosses.Ironically, The Prime Minister could still snatch victory from defeat on this issue, notwithstanding her lamentable record as Home Secretary on reducing net immigration to the tens of thousands.The alternative White Paper which David Davis and his Ministers were working on prior to it being dumped at Chequers, was much more evidence-based and looked to many workable international examples of mobility agreements between first world countries like Australia, the United States, Japan and Canada, as a model for future EU-UK immigration arrangements, to our mutual benefit.The policy would have been informed by the Migration Advisory Committee which reports next month, focused on what was the sensible policy for the whole of the UK and all business sectors rather than a noisy minority and their well-paid advocates.It also sought to end the systemic bias towards low paid and low skilled EU citizens over the well qualified from across the globe.It was pro controlled immigration and not about pulling up the drawbridge and that’s where most British voters are now.Will Theresa May use the opportunity to keep faith with the millions of people in the north and the midlands, in south Wales and south west, who look to her to keep her promises and defend their interests and not just those of the well heeled, the multinationals and those comfortable with the Brussels status quo?Will putative leadership contender Sajid Javid have the courage to resist further attempts at craven supplication on continuing free movement in all but name? Will Conservative MPs who benefited from the highest ever blue collar vote for their party in history, ignore their own electors’ concerns and just accept further concessions?The electoral prospects of her party depend on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many in work earn half what they did ten years ago.Hundreds of thousands of Greece’s brightest have fled.The Eurozone works nicely for Germany . . . but that’s it. Thank God we never signed up to it.Brexit Anxiety Disorder is real, two top psychologists believe.

And our departure from the corrupt, bullying, protectionist EU club they bizarrely consider a beacon of liberal values.Their latest co-ordinated ruse — backed by rich celebrities, has-been politicians and former newspapers — is to pretend a second referendum would “bring a divided Britain together”.They are actually arguing that after two years of abusing 17.4million Leavers as thick racists, Remainers now deserve a second chance to get what they wanted. And that, whatever the result, we would all magically unite behind it.If there’s a more laughably mad contention, we haven’t heard it.We might once have wondered what they were smoking.

Appropriation.In the eyes of today’s politically correct policers of “wrongthink”, there is no greater crime than cultural appropriation.Cultural appropriation is when people embrace the grub or music or ideas of a culture that isn’t theirs.Like when Kylie Jenner wore her hair in cornrows. Or when Katy Perry donned a Japanese kimono. Or when drunken lads on a university campus put on sombreros as they neck shots of tequila.All of these things have been branded cultural appropriation by today’s potty warriors against “offensiveness”.And to this blacklist of things we must never appropriate, we can now add non-native foods.This is not the first time Jamie Oliver has been criticised for making foreign dishes. Two years ago foodies were up in arms when he put chorizo in paella — which the Spanish tend not to do.Clearly Jamie Oliver is only allowed to cook “white” British food, like roast beef and toad-in-the-hole.Not Cornish pasties or Yorkshire puddings, though.After all, what right does a man born in Essex have to appropriate the food of Northerners and people from the West Country? And presumably Dawn Butler only ever tucks into Jamaican dishes.If it is cultural appropriation for Oliver to make jerk grub, surely it must be cultural appropriation for Ms Butler to rattle up a bit of sushi?This would be the crazy conclusion to the war on cultural appropriation — none of us would ever dip into other cultures and experience their pleasures.What is most depressing about the Butler/Oliver spat is that it confirms how mainstream the miserabilist, divisive PC worldview has gone.It used to be just time-rich posh kids and snowflakes on university campuses who raged against cultural appropriation.Like the officious students at Cambridge who banned an Around The World in 80 Days fancy-dress party for fear students would wear “culturally appropriated” costumes.Or the clipboard bores at the University of East Anglia who banned students from wearing sombreros.Or the easily offended muppets at the University of Ottawa in Canada who banned a yoga class, because for white people to indulge in this ancient Indian discipline is an act of “cultural genocide”.I bet you never knew that when you do a pelvic tilt at your local gym you are being a horrible racist.Now, however, with Butler’s missive against the crimes of Jamie Oliver, this PC claptrap has crept from the fringes into the political centre. Butler is Shadow Secretary for Women and Equalities, and she is very close to Jeremy Corbyn.Is this what we should expect under a Corbyn government? Finger-wagging at anyone who deviates from PC rules?The worst thing about the clampdown on cultural appropriation is how divisive it is. The message is that we must always stick with our own cultures and never borrow from others.Didn’t that used to be known as racism?In recent years, Beyonce has been slammed for wearing a sari. Glastonbury has banned attendees from wearing Native American head-dresses. Selena Gomez was ridiculed for doing a Bollywood- inspired dance on US TV.This new racial divisiveness makes ­culture stiff and dull.Anthony Horowitz, author of the Alex Rider teen spy novels, says he was “warned off” from writing a black character. Apparently a white writer like him ­cannot understand the black experience.Is this really the world we want to live in? Where people never mix and never try to empathise with those who have had different life experiences to theirs?We should stand up for cultural ­appropriation.The global intermingling of food and fashion and art has enriched human life.As the great American novelist Lionel Shriver reminds us: “People with different backgrounds rubbing up against each other and exchanging ideas and practices is self-evidently one of the most productive, fascinating aspects of modern urban life.”Yet in their Brave New World, everyone would stick to their own people and their own ways. What a dispiriting, divided world that would be.I would far rather live in a world than has Jamie Oliver jerk chicken in it than in such a racially regimented PC nightmare.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres something to think about next time you find yourself wedged into an economy seat with a screaming baby behind you...Owner: Qatari royal familyCost: £500 millionIf youre after high-flying luxury, you couldnt do much better than the Qatari royal familys moving mansion.The modified Boeing 747-8, a model which can carry up to 460 passengers, has been stripped out and re-fitted to suit the luxurious tastes of the Middle-Eastern royals.Decked out in gold, the plane now seats just 76 guests and 18 crew, with a warren of suites including an enormous banquet hall, luxurious bedrooms, ten bathrooms and a dedicated medical room.Like what you see? The good news is the plane is currently up for sale. The bad news is itll cost you an estimated £500m (and thats before you have to fork out for a parking space).Owner: Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, a Saudi royal and investor Cost: £380 millionWith a lounge glinting with gold and marble, and a throne-like seat in the middle of the room, youd think you were waiting for an audience in the heart of a palace.But this room is actually the jewel of the £380m custom-made Airbus A380 belonging to Saudi businessman and royal Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal.The plane was designed to fit 800 passengers, but with £16 billion in the bank, the prince could afford to strip out the usual fittings to make room for a marble-finished bath and an on-board parking space for his Rolls Royce.Today his plane is the worlds biggest private jet, containing a 14-seat dining room, a sprawling, carpeted lounge and a prayer room where computer-controlled mats pivot so theyre always facing Mecca no matter where the prince is flying.Owner: Donald TrumpCost: £63 millionBefore Donald Trump was president, he was still Donald Trump, so he naturally had his own private plane anyway.And the tycoons Boeing 757, painted black and red with his name on the side, is even more impressive than Air Force One, the presidential plane Trump now uses.With an estimated cost of £63 million, the modified Boeing has been fitted with a double bed, a spacious lounge with a wide-screen TV, and a marble bathroom, with gleaming gold accents running throughout.Trump has also been able to stamp his personal touch on every surface, with the family crest embossed on the cushions and pillows in the flying mansion.Owner: Aviation company DeerJetCost: £230 millionTheres only one private Boeing 787 Dreamliner in the world, and this is it.Built at a cost of £230 million, the jet, dubbed the flying penthouse, has been fitted out like a hotel, complete with an en suite master bedroom for a sleepy VIP.Available to charter for £20,000, the 40-seater craft has a separate lounge with space for 16 passengers, who can use personal tablets to control the lighting, blinds and TVs in their part of the jet.The swanky craft, owned by aviation company DeerJet, even has built-in showers - something the rest of us could all do with after a few hours crammed into economy seats.Owner: Crystal CruisesCost: £43,000 per hour to charterIf youre a millionaire without your own plane then you could do a lot worse than forking out £43,000 per hour to rent the Crystal Skye.The biggest charter jet in the world, this converted Boeing 777 has room for just 88 passengers, rather than the usual 300, and is designed to be rented out by wealthy socialites and groups of travelling dignitaries.Theres a fully-equipped 24-seat restaurant and professional mixologist on board, so the usual damp and anaemic in-flight meal can be swapped for a rare steak and a martini to wash it down.Whats more, every seat can be converted into a full size-bed and your ticket comes with a pair of complimentary PJs... but with double-width aisles big enough to dance in and luxury drinks on tap, youd be mad to doze off for even a minute.Owners: Oprah Winfrey, Celine Deon, Steven Spielberg Cost: £27.6 millionWhat plane do you get if youre rich and famous enough to go plane shopping, but not quite loaded enough to modify your own Boeing?Priced at £27.6 million, the Bombardier Global Express is the answer for celebs ranging from Oprah Winfrey and Celine Deon to Steven Spielberg.While not as large as the other luxury planes, this nifty jet still has room for up to 14 passengers, with a leather interior and designer fixtures throughout the cabin.And for the A-listers with busy schedules, the Global Express packs an extra punch: its designed for efficient, long-range travel, and can fly for up to 16 hours without needing to stop for refuelling.Manufacturer: BoeingCost: £280 millionThe Boeing 747-8 VIP is the longest and second largest airliner ever built... and it just might be the most luxurious plane on the market as well.With a basic price tag of £280 million, buyers can then choose from an array of interior options to fill the impressive 4,786 square feet of space.The VIP jet has a minimalist feel which runs through the stateroom, lounge, office and dining room... and its clearly been designed with a business guru in mind.The large table has been fitted out for high-flyers to take conference calls, while the white-walled bedroom offers total tranquillity as the jet cruises through the air.Owner: Harrison FordCost: £20 millionPremium plane-maker Cessna is at the forefront of the private jet business for a reason: their compact but mighty craft are the height of luxury.With their light, airy interiors and reclining armchairs for up to 12 travelling VIPs, its no surprise that models like the Citation Longitude have price tags in excess of £20 million.The Cessna 680 Sovereign, meanwhile, is a bit cheaper - but at £11.8 million its still only an option for the biggest spenders.Star Wars actor and keen pilot Harrison Ford has one (among his personal collection of eight planes)... and if its good enough for Han Solo, its good enough for anyone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

meaning they may not even know their treatment was unlawful.Amber Rudd, who quit as Home Secretary over the Windrush crisis, insisted in April that no one had been wrongly deported as a result of the scandal.But Home Office investigators have scoured records dating back two decades and found the 18 cases.All of those involved moved from the Caribbean to Britain before 1973 - meaning they gained the automatic right to stay here permanently and become a citizen.But because they were unable to produce the paperwork, they were told they were actually illegal immigrants.Of those detained, seven were released before being removed from Britain, while the others voluntarily left the country.Six of the cases date back to the previous Labour Government, while the other 12 took place under the Tories.Mr Javid said: I would like to personally apologise to those identified in our review and am committed to providing them with the support and compensation they deserve.We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again – which is why I have asked an independent adviser to look at what lessons we can learn from Windrush.Nearly 4,000 Windrush generation migrants have been given documents which will allow them to stay in Britain since the scandal broke earlier this year.Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said: This apology is overdue and is nowhere near good enough.The Government has still not got a final figure on how many of our fellow citizens were deported, forced into so-called ‘voluntary removals’ or detained as prisoners in their own country.It is an insult that the Home Secretary has still failed to confirm when the promised compensation scheme will be up and running, after so many of our fellow citizens have been left destitute, in debt and jobless by the Government’s hostile environment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427989999.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour second referendum brexit jeremy corbyn","story":"Frontbenchers are polling voters on whether they support rerunning the 2016 vote -

I took a photo. It had a neck and head was in the shape of a hook.I just took what I saw. It was black - I just dont know how far it was out of the water. Im not good at judging distances.But after about a minute it disappeared and then came back up again in a different place. It was up for less than a minute the second time.I kinda believed in Nessie, but I wanted to see the proof. I always imagined her as having a long neck and flippers.I have seen something but Im not sure what.Mum Kat said: “I couldnt believe it. Somethings there. With all the sightings over the years there must be something in the loch.Nessie expert Steve Feltham, 55, who has been searching for Nessie for 27 years said he was “totally excited” by the photo and thought it was the best one in years.So far this year there have been four official sightings of the monster.Earlier this month an unnamed tourist claimed to have filmed the monster poking out of the water of the loch.In May, a schoolgirl and her gran claimed to have caught The Loch Ness Monster on camera while going for a paddle in the iconic lake.Eight-year-old Laria Annand began recording after her gran Marie noticed a mysterious ripple on the water.Last year there were 11 accepted sightings, the highest number this century.The mystery surrounding the monster brings a huge tourist boost to the area, estimated to be worth £30million a year."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000428094757.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"plane with rapper post malone onboard set to make emergency landing after tyres exploded during take off","story":"The Luton-bound plane carrying the US star and 15 members of his entourage was forced to circle for five hours before the hero pilot made a safe landing in New York.Malone, 23, and his crew were flying from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey bound for Luton ahead of the star taking stage at Reading Festival on Friday.As the jet took off at 4pm on Monday two tyres blew out prompting the pilot to be re-routed twice by air-traffic control.But the pilot was told to continue the flight and head to Massachusetts to burn off more fuel to make the emergency landing safer.It was then diverted again before landing safely at Stewart International Airport, 60 miles north of New York City.Fans cheered as the pilot expertly touched down on the runway lined with fire engines and ambulances.Shortly after landing the rapper took to social media to blast Twitter trolls who wished death on him.Post tweeted: I landed guys.

I’m on the right, wife in the wrong.” The debate also revealed some interesting alternatives to what some people poured over custard instead of the traditional pudding of crumble.Jonny Segment wrote: “The left side is the right amount. The right side looks like an accidental spillage of custard that you might expect in any given meal, on average.”While WufflyTime thought neither were correct, writing: “Left sides too much.

This festival was his hunting ground.”It was a remarkable speech — made even more remarkable by the fact that Argento had just secretly settled a sex abuse claim against her for £300,000.The bombshell — first reported by the New York Times on Sunday but since vehemently denied by Argento — claimed that in 2013 she had sex with 17-year-old actor Jimmy Bennett in California, where the age of consent is 18.He later sought £2.7million damages from her, for the “intentional infliction of emotional distress, lost wages, assault and battery”.Now Argento could find herself in the dock like Weinstein, after the LA County Sheriff’s office launched an investigation.Within 24 hours of the Times report, Weinstein had leapt on the allegations. His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said: “This development reveals a stunning level of hypocrisy by Asia Argento.“She was one of the most vocal catalysts who sought to destroy Harvey Weinstein, despite the fact that her sexual relationship with Mr Weinstein was between two consenting adults which lasted for more than four years.”Divorced mum of two Argento, 42,  first met Jimmy Bennett when he was just seven, when she played his mum in 2004 film The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things.Over the years, they regularly joked on social media about being mother and son.But encrypted documents emailed to the New York Times detailed the alleged incident in May 2013 when Jimmy was just two months past his 17th birthday.They were due to meet for a reunion in her room at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Marina del Rey, California. Argento, then 37, had even posted on Instagram: “Waiting for my long lost son my love @jimmymbennett in trepidation #marinadelrey smoking cigarettes like there was no next week.”Jimmy, now a rock musician, responded: “I’m almost there!”According to the leaked “intention of notice to sue”, Jimmy had been taken to the hotel by a family member, but Argento asked to be alone with him. It is alleged she then gave him alcohol and began kissing him.Jimmy claims she pushed him on to the bed, removed his trousers and performed oral sex on him. She climbed on top of him and they had sex, claims the notice of intent.The document also included three photos taken by Jimmy during the encounter — at Argento’s request — showing them both half naked.Argento later posted on Instagram: “Happiest day of my life reunion with @jimmymbennett xox.” She shared several more pictures of their encounter, including one of herself hugging him in the hotel.She captioned it: “My son my love until I will live @jimmymbennett marina del ray 05.2013.”Jimmy said that as he returned home he felt “extremely confused, mortified and disgusted” — but a month later he sent Argento a Twitter message from his now deleted account saying: “Miss you momma!!!!” with a photo of an engraved bracelet she had given him.After Jimmy’s intention to sue, documents showed that Argento agreed to pay him £300,000.In a letter to Argento in April, her lawyer Carrie Goldberg described the payment as “helping Mr Bennett” — but Jimmy says the alleged incident left him with emotional and financial problems.His lawyers claimed the “sexual battery” was so traumatic that it hindered his work and threatened his mental health.After receiving his demand for money and dealing with it in private with her lawyer, Argento continued to push #MeToo.She spoke about the movement at Harvard and last October she was interviewed by journalist Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker magazine for an article which blew open allegations of sexual assault by Harvey Weinstein, five days after he was named as an abuser in the New York Times.Argento was one of three women in the piece who claimed Weinstein raped them.She was introduced to him aged 21 in 1997 before appearing in 1998 film B Monkey, which was  distributed by his Miramax company. She claimed he asked her to give him a massage alone in his room with lotion, before forcibly performing oral sex on her.Argento  admitted in the article that she later grew close to Weinstein and had willing sexual encounters with him, saying: “After the rape, he won.”In the months after the story was published, Argento and her boyfriend, celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, became vocal supporters of the #MeToo movement. Bourdain tweeted: “Can we use the word ‘rapist’ now? #Weinstein”.But in June this year Bourdain hanged himself, days after shots emerged of Argento in an intimate embrace with another man. She was defended by fellow #MeToo figure Rose McGowan after the tragedy, but since the underage sex claims Rose has said: “I got to know Asia Argento ten months ago.Our commonality is the shared pain of being assaulted by Harvey Weinstein. My heart is broken.  None of us know the truth of the situation and I’m sure more will be revealed.”Jimmy Bennett was not made to sign a non-disclosure agreement after the settlement with Argento, as she  viewed it as “inconsistent” with her public message, but his lawyer, Gordon Sattro, said that Argento presenting herself as a victim was key to his intention to sue.He added: “His feelings about that day were brought to the forefront recently when Ms Argento took the spotlight as one of the many victims of Harvey Weinstein.”Last night Argento said in a statement: “I am deeply shocked and hurt by having read news that is absolutely false. I have never had any sexual relationship with Bennett.“Subsequent to my exposure in the Weinstein case, Bennett — who was then undergoing severe economic problems and who had previously undertaken legal actions against his own family requesting millions in damages — unexpectedly made an exorbitant request of money from me.“Bennett knew my boyfriend, Anthony Bourdain, was a man of great perceived wealth and had his own reputation as a beloved public figure to protect.“Antony (sic) insisted the matter be handled privately and this was also what Bennett wanted.“We decided to deal compassionately with Bennett’s demand for help and give it to him.“Anthony personally undertook to help Bennett economically, upon the condition that we would no longer suffer any further intrusions in our life.”She added: “I have therefore no other choice but to oppose such false allegations and will assume in the short term all necessary initiatives for my protection before all competent venues.”Court documents showed Jimmy had fallen out with his mother and stepfather over the state of a trust into which some of his earnings as an actor had been deposited, according to a 2014 lawsuit.He claimed his parents had barred him from the family’s house and kept his possessions, and over the years had cheated him out of at least £1.1million in earnings.Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to six felony counts in New York, including first-degree rape. None is related to Argento.Campaigners are wondering whether the #MeToo movement can survive, now that one of its most vocal leaders has been embroiled in abuse claims herself.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A poll of 2,000 homeowners found more than one in three have itchy feet in their home and is currently looking to move due to outgrowing the property, or feeling it is too small. Other tell-tale signs a move is imminent include ignoring DIY and maintenance jobs which need doing, continually complaining about your property and paying more attention to other people’s houses.  Slowing down every time you drive or walk past a ‘For Sale’ sign, spending more time outside your home than you do inside it and imagining how you would decorate a new property also made it on to the list. The study commissioned by Keepmoat Homes also revealed the average homeowner begins to get ‘itchy feet’ in their home after nine years of living there.

James Thomson, Chief Executive at Keepmoat Homes, said: “Buying a home is a life- changing purchase so when you first move it is usually to a property you have fallen in love with. But after a few years, especially if your financial situation improves, many people start to think about moving up the property ladder. “It isn’t surprising to see that the need for more space is the top reason that people decide to move – in the past some of our customers have even moved homes on the same development because they really love the area and the style of their home but, as their family has grown, they have wanted more space.”  Researchers who polled 2,000 homeowners found 71 per cent admit they often stop and have a nose at the homes for sale in estate agent windows. And two thirds spend an average of 15 minutes a day on sites such as Rightmove and Zoopla searching for their next potential home. It also emerged the average homeowner lived in their first home for six years before the ‘For Sale’ sign went up with most people moving because they wanted a bigger house. Finding a home in a better location, with a bigger garden or to get away from an annoying or anti-social neighbour are other common reasons for moving.  But 41 per cent admit they are stuck in their current home because they haven’t got the money to move while another 23 per cent can’t find a property they like. And more than one in five are staying put for the time being because they don’t want to deal with the stress of buying. James Thomson added: “Concerns about money and the stress of buying were the key reasons why people choose to stay where they are. This is one of the advantages of buying a new-build property as you will have a Homes Sales Executive with you to offer advice and help every step of the way.

The sinister \u0026pound70 garment - complete with a pocket and trademark Nike “tick” - caused uproar with anti-knife campaigners branding it “menacing”. Created by trendsetting American designer Matthew Williams who has made outfits for chart star Lady Gaga and lists stars like rapper Kanye West as fans of his Alyx brand, the balaclava has already gained notoriety.  Despite Nike removing the x MMW from its official website, the head gear commonly associated with gangsters and bank robbers is like gold-dust with sites across the world sold out. But it has been slated on social media sites by anti-crime campaigners who condemned Nike for “exploiting” youth gang culture. Paul McKenzie of Tottenham, North London who regularly speaks out about knife crime amongst London’s black community said on Facebook: “You know these young people on the street adore these manufacturers, they buy everything that they sell. “We look at images of young people on the street and they look menacing already, and so Nike decides to bring out a balaclava range which looks absolutely menacing. Maybe I’m getting old, maybe I’m a dinosaur, but this balaclava range looks quite inciteful.” "},{"url":null,"title":"stormy daniels vindicated after micheal","story":"NewsStormy Daniels \u0027vindicated\u0027 after Michael Cohen pleads guilty to paying her \u0027at direction of US president\u0027The porn star said Cohen paid her $130,000 shortly before the November 2016 election to keep her quiet about an alleged sexual encounter with the US presidentShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByZoe ShentonUS Showbiz Editor (Digital)00:02, 22 AUG 2018Updated07:27, 22 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailStormy Daniels has released a statement saying she feels vindicated after Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to paying her hush money at the direction of a candidate for federal office, presumed to be US President Donald Trump. Donald Trump\u0027s former personal lawyer had previously admitted to arranging $130,000 hush money for the porn star, 39, who claimed she had an affair with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied the claims. Appearing in court in New York today, Cohen admitted making an excessive campaign contribution on October 27, 2016 - a month before the presidential election. He told the court he arranged to make payments for (the) principal purpose of influencing (the) election at the direction of a candidate for federal office.  Following Cohen\u0027s court appearance, Stormy Daniels released a statement to NBC News saying: Michael (Avenatti) and I are vindicated and we look forward to the apologies from the people who claimed we were wrong. She also tweeted: How do ya like me now!? #teamstormy. He also told the court he made a payment ex Playboy model Karen McDougal, who claimed she engaged in a 10-month romantic relationship in 2006 and 2007. While Cohen didn\u0027t name Trump in court, his lawyer later said Trump directed his client to commit a crime. Today he stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election, Cohen\u0027s lawyer Lanny Davis said in a statement.    If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn\u0027t they be a crime for Donald Trump? Davis said. Under U.S. election law, campaign contributions, defined as things of value given to a campaign in order to influence an election, must be disclosed. A payment intended to silence allegations of an affair just before an election could constitute a campaign contribution, some experts have said.  Cohen, who once said he would take a bullet for Trump, agreed to a plea bargain with federal prosecutors earlier Tuesday. He also pleaded guilty to five counts of tax fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. The plea deal includes a possible sentence of up to five years and three months in prison, Judge William Pauley III said during the hearing.

The 24-year-old patent went to A\u0026ampE at Newham University Hospital, complaining that he was constipated and had suffered from diarrhoea over the previous week.  A physical examination by medics revealed that he had a tender, distended abdomen with quiet bowel sounds, the British Medical Journal reported .  Doctors then performed an x-ray and were shocked to discover that his colon had dialated up to seven inches and was filled with poo. The patient, who suffers from autism, was prescribed laxatives by doctors but refused the enemas which they hoped would cure his condition.  Records showed that the unnamed patient had suffered from severe constipation over the past four years. He returned just two days later and said that his abdominal pain was more severe than his previous visit. A test by doctors showed that he had a dangerous intestine infection known as peritonitis - meaning his renal function was collapsing and that his organs were starting to fail. Dr Alexandros Apostolopoulos and his team then performed a repeat CT scan on the man, discovering that he had a substantial perforation of his sigmoid colon. He was rushed to the operating room where surgeons performed a Hartman procedure to fix the life-threatening tear on his colon.

After he posted the letter on Facebook, Mr Quinn\u0027s friends joked he could pay the outstanding amount in 2p monthly instalments. The company director claimed he had no idea what the bill related to and said he had received no previous reminders from Amphora Trading Ltd, a private firm owned and run by Colchester Borough Council.

The correspondence, dated August 14, was a last reminder for his company Food and Drink Festivals UK to clear the amount. Despite doubting the debt, the honourable businessman decided to pay cash in hand at the town hall to avoid any more expense to the taxpayer. It was his only option seeing as his BACS system would not accept a 10p payment, he explained.

Austin Ross, 23, stuck racist posters on buildings around his home city as well as torching a school and a masonic lodge, causing tens of thousands of pounds worth of damage, Wales Online reports.  A court heard Ross was both a supporter of Tommy Robinson and far-right group System Resistance Network and painted their initials SRN, as well as messages such as ‘Free Tommy Robinson’, on buildings.  Between May 2 and May 31 this year he spray painted Nazi symbols and stuck racist propaganda on to landmarks around Newport .   Prosecutor Jason Howells told Newport Crown Court that Ross first targeted the city’s Riverfront Theatre by posting a “racially abusive poster” on a window pane.   Mr Howells said: “The poster was linked to the System Resistance Network and there were swastikas spray painted next to it.” Ross went on to post racist posters on Bethel Community Church which read: ‘Marxist maggots we remember faces, names places. SRN.’ His next target was Newport’s multicultural Maindee Primary School, where parents reported seeing racist posters outside it referring to refugees and the message ‘You have been visited by the SRN’. Ross returned to the school four days later to spray paint several swastikas on its walls. The slogan ‘1488’ was painted by Ross on to the outside wall of Gwent Probation Services – with 14 being code for “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children”, coined by white supremacist David Lane, and 88 being code for “Heil Hitler”.  Ross also wrote ‘Free Tommy Robinson’ along with graffiti of swastikas at the University of South Wales campus. He then caused \u0026pound38,000 worth of damage by causing a fire at Newport’s Masonic Lodge, which had a Star of David on the front of the building, and another \u0026pound20,000 worth of damage by starting another fire at Bassaleg Secondary School, of which he is an ex-pupil. Gwent Police released CCTV recordings to the public which caught Ross in the act of several of the incidents, which resulted in him being identified after an anonymous tip-off.

The Government announced that it will ban the sale of puppies by pet shops, online dealers and other third party sellers. Environment Secretary Michael Gove heaped praise on the campaign which highlighted how these sellers rely on puppies supplied by callous commercial breeders who raise animals in horrendous conditions.  We will eliminate puppy farming,” he declared in a speech at Number 10, Downing Street. “We will make sure third party sales of kittens and puppies ends. Far too many of the pets that people, with the best will in the world, bring into their homes we know have been brought up in squalid circumstances, in circumstances of pain and suffering and misery which should never be inflicted on any living thing.” He singled out for praise Brighton vet Marc Abraham, the founder of Lucy\u0027s Law, Pup Aid, Care And Respect Includes All Dogs (CARIAD), and Canine Action UK and told the Mirror: “Congratulations on your campaign”.  An ecstatic Marc Abraham, said: “I\u0027m delighted with the news that Lucy\u0027s Law is finally going to happen. “For years irresponsible breeders in the UK and abroad - puppy farmers - have always used third parties to keep themselves well-hidden from the buying public. “By banning third party sellers, Lucy\u0027s Law will ensure all breeders are accountable, making it the first major step in tackling puppy farm cruelty. “Lucy\u0027s Law is a tribute to Lucy and all the victims of the third party puppy trade and I thank all my fellow campaigners, supporters, parliamentarians, celebrities and ethical animal welfare organisations for their help in protecting the future health and happiness of this country\u0027s dogs and cats. He added: “It’s been phenomenal having the support of Andrew Penman and the Daily Mirror keeping this issue in the news”.  A statement from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs detailed how the ban would mean that anyone wanting to buy or adopt a puppy or kitten must either deal directly with the breeder, or with an animal rehoming centre. Celebrities at the event included Brian May, who said: “This is wonderful, all credit to Michael Gove for listening to the public and to Marc Abraham who has campaigned for this fearlessly”. Actor Peter Egan said: “I’m euphoric, Lucy’s Law is the way to stop this dreadful puppy trade.”  Thrilled Eamonn Holmes praised the MPs who united behind the campaign, saying: “I’m delighted it’s got cross party support, this is what politics should be about, fighting for the greater good.” Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today magazine, has highlighted the horrors of third party puppy sales for years. She lavished praise on Marc Abraham and the tens of thousands of members of the public who signed the Lucy\u0027s Law petition. “This is a victory for common sense and democracy - the biggest leap for animal welfare in our lifetime,” she said. “It’s always been illogical that we licenced something so abhorrent. “It was Marc who first saw this elegant and achievable goal of banning third party sales. “Despite surprising hurdles, he never doubted, never gave up and it has been a huge honour to help amplify his message. “Things are at last going to get better for our best friends.”  Linda Goodman of campaign group Care And Respect Includes All Dogs declared: “This is an enormous breakthrough for animal welfare. “If people are insistent on buying a puppy – despite our rescue centres overflowing with beautiful, healthy, loving dogs they could adopt - then they will now have to physically go directly to a breeder and see what the health and disposition of the mother is like.” Eileen Jones of the charity Friends of Animals Wales has taken in hundreds of dogs abandoned by puppy farmers. “What has kept me going through the very darkest of days and nights has been the belief that one day there would be a campaign to end this abuse of man\u0027s best friend,” she said. “Lucy\u0027s Law is the best hope we have ever had of changing the whole system of acquiring a new family member and with the support of the Government and of the public we will at long last be able to ensure that dogs receive the very best standards of care.”  A central supporter in Parliament was Scottish Nationalist MP Lisa Cameron, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Dog Advisory Welfare Group, who was almost in tears at the news. It\u0027s been a groundbreaking campaign, she said. Since the launch in December we\u0027ve had overwhelming support from the public, celebrities, MPs from all parties and - credit where it\u0027s due - from journalists, its been fantastic, we\u0027ve achieved this together. David Bowles, assistant director of public affairs at the RSPCA, said: “The RSPCA knows first-hand the misery the puppy trade causes to dogs and families. “The only people who profit from this unscrupulous trade are the sellers. “We believe it’s vital to crackdown on this underground trade to provide much-needed protection to dogs and people, and welcome an end to the third-party sales of puppies. “Coupled with the new licensing regime and proper enforcement, we believe the new system will help ensure better health and welfare for dogs and will better protect people from being duped by unscrupulous sellers.” An early backer of Lucy’s Law was the International Fund for Animal Welfare.  Its UK director Philip Mansbridge said: “This is a fantastic result for thousands and thousands of puppies. “It’s been such a big problem for such a long time, we must thank Michael Gove and all the organisers who have worked tirelessly to make this happen. “Thank you Daily Mirror for keeping it in the public eye.” The Kennel Club was absolutely delighted with the annoucement.  “The Kennel Club has long called for an end to the sale of puppies in pet shops and by other third party retailers, as puppy farmers often use such outlets to sell their pups to unsuspecting members of the public who never see the terrible conditions that the pups were raised in, said Secretary Caroline Kisko.   “When this policy is implemented it will stop the suffering of many dogs and send a very strong message to puppy buyers that it is never ok to see a puppy in any environment other than the one it was born and raised in, and with its mum. Responsible breeders, such as a Kennel Club Assured Breeder, will have nothing to hide and would simply never sell their puppies to a pet dealer or pet shop, and would always speak at length with a prospective owner before selling them one of their puppies. As part its animal welfare reform programme, the Government is also bringing in higher maximum sentences of up to five years for animal abusers, the toughest sentencing in Europe.

She was in terrible shape when when taken in by dog lover Lisa Garner.  Problems included fused hips and a curved spine from being kept in a cramped cage, malnourishment, chronic dry eye, epilepsy, bald patches to her fur, and skin that smelled like burning flesh from the ammonia in the urine she was forced to sleep in. “It was clear from her physical condition that she had been subjected to appalling conditions,” said Lisa. “However, with lots of patience, Lucy went on to enjoy a full, albeit far too short life, filled with happiness, and her love for life radiated to all those who met her.” Even before the official launch of Lucy\u0027s Law, Lucy was a well-known figure at Pup Aid and similar events, acting as a reminder of all those breeding dogs still suffering out of sight in puppy farms. When Lucy died in 2016 she had more than 70,000 Facebook followers.

The property occupies the top two floors of the building, which was built in 1932 to serve Shenley Hospital, near Radlett.   Sandra Lenson, 74, who lives in the three-bedroom flat with husband Trevor, 81, said the tower - which was used as a look-out post during the Second World War - now acts as a perfect vantage point to carry out her neighbourhood watch duties.  She said it provides views over four counties with London\u0027s St Paul\u0027s Cathedral and the Shard visible on a clear day.  Perched at more than 130ft (around 40m), the couple enjoy regular visits from birds of prey. We get kites. There\u0027s a pair of them that often pass our windows, Mrs Lenson said. They sort of glide past and still never fail to amaze us. It\u0027s a bird\u0027s-eye view. The Lensons, who have been in the freehold flat since 2011, now want to move to a property with a garden but have fond memories of living in the unique space.  It\u0027s incredible because the flat is beautiful, it\u0027s perfect in size and even when you have a few people round it feels spacious, Mrs Lenson said. It\u0027s very open, with all the windows, cool in the summer and warm in the winter - we\u0027ve got underfloor heating. If you tell people about where you live they are amazed and if you show them pictures they are even more amazed because it\u0027s so different.

Matt West, who runs \u0027Miwk\u0027 a comic and collectibles shop in Reigate, Surrey said every summer holiday he sees a spike in the numbers of parents leaving their kids in his shop on their own. He has now reached his wits end after being faced with unaccompanied children crying, fighting with rolls of wrapping paper and breaking stock.  It is bizarre, he told Surrey Live .   We live in a time when people are paranoid about leaving their kids, or about people talking to them, so leaving them in a shop for an hour or so seems odd. My daughter is 13 and I don\u0027t think I would ever have done that with her. It\u0027s not that we don\u0027t want people to leave their kids for five minutes to look around, but it\u0027s every case on it\u0027s merits. Children aged between seven and 12 are being left for anything up to, and in excess of, two hours, he said.  His account of some of the incidents this summer, outlined in a frustrated Facebook post, included the following: A guy left three boys in the shop saying to them he was off to Morrison\u0027s and would be back in half an hour, stipulating \u0027We\u0027re not buying anything!\u0027  By the time he\u0027d returned, the kids had been thrown out of the shop. They had been fighting with tubes of wrapping paper at the back of the shop, then started kicking soft toys about before breaking two mugs. They were sent out of the shop and told to wait outside by the window for their dad to get back.  When he got back he was furious with us for throwing his kids out of the shop and refused to pay for the damage they had caused saying it was \u0027not down to him to keep an eye on them\u0027. In another incident, a mother left three children for 90 minutes, while she went to the dentist. And last year, Mr West said he had to call the police when a mother left her children, one as young as seven, for more than two hours. When officers called her, she was in Croydon. We\u0027re not unreasonable here, he added in the post. We get regular kids popping in after school or during the holidays to browse and kill some time. We\u0027re fine with that. But we are not a child-minding service. Knowingly leaving your kids in a shop while you do something else is not fair on them or us.  This coupled with the news last week that kids were left in a car in Morrison\u0027s car park on a hot day unattended suggests there is a problem in Reigate at the moment, most likely related to the school holidays .

Rose Palmer was shopping in her local supermarket, in Stoneycroft, Liverpool on Monday when she claims she was insulted by a man. The 29-year-old said she was shopping for tampons when the man asked her what size are you going to get? However, when she ignored his advances she claims he reportedly said: I best leave you, you are an ugly b***h anyway.  Rose, from Warrington, told the Liverpool Echo: I am a bit of a bargain shopper and I was actually looking at some tampons and pads when this man started talking to me very quietly. I didn\u0027t even really know he was talking to me, because he was quite far away, so I just ignored him. But then he came closer and was talking again and said \u0027getting a bargain are you - what size are you going to get?\u0027 I didn\u0027t want to be rude because if someone talks to me I will respond, but I just knew he was being a nuisance so I just ignored him.  And that\u0027s when he said - \u0027I best leave you, you are an ugly b***h anyway\u0027. Rose, who said she has been insulted by men before, said she decided to film the moment because she was not letting it happen to her again. In the footage Rose can be seen confronting the man, who appears to try and grab her phone off her, when he realises she is recording. She can be heard saying you don\u0027t talk to women this way, don\u0027t talk to them in this way, don\u0027t call them ugly to which the man responds I\u0027m sorry.  Rose, who works in property management, said: I just thought to myself, this is not happening again. I know I was only dressed in converse and jeans but even if I had been stood there in all my finery - he doesn\u0027t have the right to comment on what I am wearing and call me ugly. He tried to grab my phone off me because I was recording, but it seemed appropriate to continue recording him. And I feel like he got the gist of it and he did seem embarrassed.  But the problem is that men, and women, because I am not just saying it is men, think its okay to speak to people like that. Unfortunately it is not rare and this behaviour is all too common. But I just needed to call it out. Rose, who is engaged to her partner, added: Being called ugly, it doesn\u0027t bother me. I have a man who loves me. What bothers me is that this man felt he had the right to say that, to someone who was just stood there in a supermarket, minding their own business.

Through a network of fake news websites and fraudulent social media personas spread across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google Plus and YouTube, the Iranian-linked campaign pushed narratives in line with the country\u0027s interests. The campaign was aimed at users in the United States, Britain, Latin America and Middle East up through this month, according to an analysis by the cybersecurity company FireEye Inc, which first spotted the behavior. Russia has been linked to similar online influence campaigns, including an effort to sow political divisions among U.S. voters, but FireEye said its findings showed that the same tactics are now being used for different aims.  U.S. lawmakers echoed the sentiment. It really shows it\u0027s not just Russia that engages in this type of activity, Lee Foster, an information operations analyst with FireEye, told Reuters. The firm said the Iranian activity included anti-Saudi, anti-Israeli, and pro-Palestinian themes and advocacy of policies favorable to Iran such as the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. The finding comes as concerns are rising about foreign attempts to disrupt the U.S. midterm election in November.

Little Charlotte Robinson was staying at Loch Ness Highland Lodges at Invermoriston when Nessie supposedly popped up about 50 feet away - on the first day of her trip. The legendary creature is said to have surfaced for about a minute before reappearing about ten feet further away some seven minutes later - but for less than 60 seconds. Charlotte was on holiday with parents Kat, 41, a business intelligence data analyst, and father Dave, 52, a factory worker. It was at around 7pm last Friday when Charlotte believed she saw the creature and captured it on her phone.  There was something in the water about 50 feet from the shore. I took a photo. It had a neck and head was in the shape of a hook, said Charlotte. I just took what I saw. It was black - I just don\u0027t know how far it was out of the water. I\u0027m not good at judging distances. But after about a minute it disappeared and then came back up again in a different place. It was up for less than a minute the second time. I kind of believed in Nessie, but I wanted to see the proof. I always imagined her as having a long neck and flippers. I have seen something but I\u0027m not sure what. Mum Kat added: Charlotte said she had taken a photo of a creature in the loch and I said \u0027right, sure you have!\u0027 For weeks she\u0027s been going on about seeing the Loch Ness Monster. But when I saw the picture, I couldn\u0027t believe it. Something\u0027s there. With all the sightings over the years there must be something in the loch.  Nessie expert Steve Feltham - who has dedicated his life to solving the mystery of the Loch Ness Monster for the past 27 years - was astonished by the image. I am totally excited by this photograph - it is the best of \u0027Nessie\u0027 in years, said Mr Feltham. The 55-year-old is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records for the longest continuous monster hunting vigil of Loch Ness. There is clearly a solid object in it and it is relatively clear. It warrants further study. There may be a mundane explanation such as a seal, but I have not heard of a seal in the loch this year. For my money it is larger than a seal or an ottter. It is a fantastic picture by Charlotte. There have been four recorded sightings this year of the Loch Ness Monster. The last previous glimpse of Nessie occurred on August 5 at 9.38am when a family, regular visitors to the area, were on holiday - also from Leeds. It has now been accepted by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings\u0027 Register. After travelling from Drumnadrochit to Fort Augustus they looked out at the loch and spotted a strange looking lump on the surface of the water, which was very still and quiet at the time, said the register. It looked dark brown in colour and \u0027sort of like an upturned boat\u0027. They revisited the area by boat in the afternoon and there was nothing like that in that area. Unfortunately because they were driving and couldn\u0027t pull in, they didn\u0027t manage to get any pictures.  In June the first sighting of the Loch Ness Monster in moonlight was recorded - and in front of an 11-year-old girl. The third sighting of the year of the legendary monster was also accepted by the official Nessie register. Natalie Hodgson and her family, on holiday from Yorkshire, took a picture of the head of an unknown creature in the water at 10.30pm on June 1 from the Highland Lodges holiday park where they were staying. The creature remained for a few minutes caught in the moonlight before disappearing. It follows a remarkable, feature film length video of the Loch Ness Monster shot by a Nessie watcher from Ireland on April 30. Hospital clerical worker Eoin O\u0027Faodhagain from Donegal took a ten minute video from the Loch Ness webcam. The creature moves from right to left and as it swam towards Urquhart Bay - a favourite haunt of Nessie - and is seen supposedly diving and surfacing with water splashes. DNA sampling recently took place to discover previously unrecorded organisms in Loch Ness.

One neighbour that doesn\u0027t quite get on with the rest of the people in the building or on the street. The kind of person that leaves behind passive aggressive notes when someone has done something to their disliking. Or, in this case, the kind of person who comes to your house and criticises what you\u0027ve decided to wear in the privacy of your own home. One mum has shared her neighbour\u0027s troubling behaviour in an online forum and revealed she received a good telling off - for wearing pyjamas.  In a post on Mumsnet by a user named Practicallyperfectwithprosecco, the mum asked others if she was being unreasonable to think she could wear what she wanted at home. She wrote: New neighbours and I think they might be slightly mad. Few weeks ago she complained about me and oldest daughter being in the garden wearing bikinis (not even teeny bikinis) as she has a husband and a teenage son and they might see us. I tried hard to make sure if I was out sunbathing I was away from her garden and moved the kids pool so it would be harder for them to be seen from their fence.  She thought this would settle the problem with her neighbour. But things only got worse.The mum added: This morning I was cleaning kitchen in my pjs (vest and shorts so not revealing. Daughter was stood by open patio doors chatting to me in shorts and a crop top she sleeps in.  Next thing next door is banging on my front door telling me I\u0027m continuing to disrespect her and her family by the provocative way we dress!  The neighbour then threatened to complain to the mum\u0027s husband if she continued to flaunt herself. The mum was shocked by this and at a loss for words. Other parents were quick to point out how ridiculous the neighbour was being about the whole thing. One said: Surely that’s harassment (by her towards you). A letter detailing what happened so far and telling her to stop, by registered mail, might be a useful step.

The incident took place at the famous Altare della Patria (Altar of the Fatherland) national monument in the Italian capital which commemorates the country\u0027s war dead.

As summer sunshine pours on the Rome monument, several friends can be seen dipping their feet into the water and taking photos of their semi-naked pals. One of the men pulls his underwear down and stuffs his genitals between his legs to pose naked for photos. Numerous visitors walk past the giggling Brits as they continue to misbehave outside the iconic monument, built to honour Italy\u0027s unification.  The site is positioned between the Piazza Venezia and Capitoline Hill and holds the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier which includes an eternal flame, built in memory of the fallen soldiers of World War I. Local authorities prohibit behaviour that damages or disrespects its famous landmarks and police are trying to track down the misbehaving tourists. Police in Rome have released a picture of the men frolicking in the fountain and said officers are carrying out all the necessary checks to trace the authors of the gesture, which seriously offends the national sentiment and memory of the fallen to whom the monument is dedicated.

Passenger Kay Longstaff, 46, \u0027tumbled\u0027 off the back of the Norwegian Star on Saturday, while cruising 60 miles off the Croatian coast en route to Venice. Air hostess Kay then survived 10 hours adrift in the Adriatic Sea, claiming yoga and singing helped her stay alive. Kay said her love of yoga kept her fit enough to keep swimming and said she sang to keep warm as she drifted throughout the night.  Now safe and back on dry land, Kay is said to have had an emotional and full of love reunion with her boyfriend Craig Rayment, according to The Sun. Hospital director, Irena Hrstic, told the newspaper that Kay said: It has happened, what has happened and I want to come home as soon as possible.  It comes after reports she may have jumped after a row with boyfriend.  Croatian officials say CCTV images show Kay was alone at the time of the incident at 11.45pm on Saturday, 60 miles off the coast. Her partner Craig was said to be in bed when the drama unfolded. The electrician reported her missing at 2am, several hours after she vanished.   Kay claimed she fell from the seventh deck of the 294m liner but other tourists have insisted it would have been “impossible” to accidentally slip over the chest-high railings surrounding the decks.  American Eddie Palladino, 60, who was on the cruise with his wife and two children, told The Mirror: “We were woken up by alarm bells going off and then there was an announcement from the captain. “He said: ‘I’m calling to alert you now that we have a reported jumper off the ship and we’re now in a search and rescue mission.’ “He didn’t say anything about an \u0026shyaccident and called her a ‘jumper’.  The railings right across the ship are very high. I’m 6ft tall and would have to climb up to get over them. She didn’t fall by \u0026shyaccident. Her shirt was found on the deck. I’m happy she survived… it’s a miracle.” Kay was rescued by the Croatian Coast Guard patrol ship, Cavat, and the captain, Lovro Oreskovic, said she had been worried about paying for the rescue effort. He told local newspaper Jutarnji List: She told us it was the last day of her three weeks holidays. We warmed her up, gave her first aid, she took some water, then a soup, an isotonic drunk and a pudding before she fell asleep. Before that she asked whether she would need to pay for the expenses of the search. But we calmed her down.  Her father Ron Longstaff said today he has been watching the news about the bizarre incident while trying to understand what happened onboard. Asked about whether his daughter had been going through a distressing period recently, Mr Longstaff said: That\u0027s rubbish. I was sitting in the sun with her a few weeks ago. Speaking on the doorstep of his home in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, he added: I\u0027m watching the news and trying to get to the bottom of what happened. Following her rescue, Ms Longstaff said she felt very lucky to have survived the ordeal and thanked her wonderful rescuers as she was taken to a hospital in the Croatian town of Pula. She told Croatian news channel HRT: I fell off the back of the Norwegian Star and I was in the water for 10 hours, so these wonderful guys rescued me.

The Avatar-style \u0027bot was revealed by Kalashnikov at the Army 2018 Fair just outside Moscow, as a \u0027demonstration of what is to come.\u0027 The robot can walk and has space in a cabin for people to sit and operate the robot from inside and can hold and move objects with its claws, including weapons. The pilots are protected from bullets, debris and any other dangerous object behind the armoured glass and metal encasement. The gold robot, which has been called Igorek, is still under construction and the creators do not wish to reveal all its characteristics until they have finished.  It looks eerily like the Amplified Mobility Platform (AMP) mech suits that humans use in James Cameron\u0027s sci-fi classic. In the 2009 flick the Pandora Utility Suit is used by the army as they try to take over the Na\u0027vi. While Kalashnikov are remaining tight-lipped on any further details at the moment, Igorek is likely to be used to magnify soldiers\u0027 strength while providing protection from military and environmental threats - just like the AMP suits in Avatar.  Other people have also compared the robot to the ?D-209 (Enforcement Droid series 209) from the Robocop series. Vladimir Dmitriev from the Kalashnikov group, said: This robot is probably one of the hottest new models of the \u0027Army 2018\u0027.

Kay was rescued after treading water for 10 hours 60 miles from land and insists she fell. But Kelly Rayment who split with electrician Craig, 43, after their volatile relationship fell apart, said bluntly: “If I was on a ship with him I would get off any way I could.” The mum-of-two, 38, added acidly: “Craig’s not a very nice person when he’s been drinking.  “So him going on a cruise is a recipe for disaster. I can imagine what she went through.”  Kelly had been married to Craig for a year when they moved to Spain’s Costa del Sol. But she left him after constant rows and they are now in the process of divorcing. She added: “I’m proud of myself for building up the courage to leave him and saying no when he begged me to come back.”   Kelly says she passed a warning to Kay, 46, after the air hostess began dating Craig last year. She has sons aged 14 and 21 from a previous relationship and met Craig while a barmaid in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Passengers on the Norwegian Star, on a cruise in the Adriatic, say Kay and Craig had a drunken row before Kay plunged from the seventh deck on Saturday night.  CCTV shows her alone at the time. Kay was finally rescued by a Croatian coast guard vessel on Sunday morning. The couple moved in together last November and are said to be living near Marbella.

It was just a terrible performance from the start.“I thought we were slack, very poor in possession.“Ayr had several early corners that put us on the back foot, there were bits of the first half where we got going but it really wasn’t good enough.“As a team, it’s not often I’ve seen so many players off form in one game. It was the polar opposite of Aberdeen last week, against the second best team in the country for the last few years, where we more than matched them.“The players can’t just take plaudits for how well they play and miss chances and then turn in a performance like that, it’s just not acceptable.”Striker Sofien Moussa was dropped to the bench after a poor run in front of goal but did his chances of a reprieve no good whatsoever after his introduction from the dugout.Within 15 minutes of replacing Jean Mendy, Moussa’s continual fouling caught up with him as referee John Beaton gave him his marching orders after a barge on Ayr midfielder Mark Kerr.And to cap things off, centre-back Genseric Kusunga was shown a straight red with the final kick of the game, scything down Michael Moffat in injury time.Neil added: “It was really poor from him, really poor from Gense.“I told Moussa that he can’t be making silly fouls, especially the one where he dived in to try to make a tackle on a yellow card.“It was a very dangerous game and he was warned and then paid the price for a poor challenge.“Then Gense obviously lost his composure and got a straight red which hurts us for this weekend, adding insult to injury.“Moussa had a great impact on the game, getting sent off, but, on the whole, our performance had a greater impact from start to finish, just not good enough.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba looks to make signings after taking dundee united squad to aviemore for team bonding","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United boss Csaba Laszlo could still add to

signing last summer, snapped up under the noses of then-Championship side Brechin City.And despite missing large chunks of last season with injury, Neil is delighted to see Spence make the step up to the top flight so well.“Spence has been terrific since he’s come in,” he said.“I think he’s really enjoyed the responsibility of being in there and because we’re playing with a bit of control in front of the back four, it’s his natural game.“He’s been great.“I always knew what Spence was capable of – it was about getting him to believe it.“He’s a winner but he’s jumped levels to come into the

four because Glen Kamara generally stole a lot of the limelight in that position last year.“Spence has gone in there and done really well.“We’ve been strong in the middle of the park, other areas we clearly need to add to.”There was a worry Spence would be ruled out for today’s League Cup last-16 clash with Ayr United after picking up a knock on his ankle last week.However, he has declared

difficult skill is usually finding the piece of magic in the final third that leads to goals.But, for fast-emerging Dundee United kid Declan Glass, it’s the simple side of the game he’s working hard at to add to his unquestioned abilities.The 18-year-old’s form was one of the big positives of the pre-season and a difficult Betfred Cup campaign for the Tangerines.So much so, in fact, some Arabs feel, despite his tender years, he should already be commanding a regular starting place in Csaba Laszlo’s side.The manager, though, has already expressed his determination not to heap too much pressure on the teenage attacker and risk burning him out.There are aspects of his game Csaba wants Glass to work on and the player himself has taken that on board.And one area where he knows he can improve in is, at times, playing the easy pass that keeps possession.“Sometimes I do need to do things simpler. I complicate my game sometimes but I’m working on just playing it simple and that’s what the gaffer and (assistant manager) Laurie Ellis want me to do.“They stress to me I have to play it simple at times and then do the magic when I can.”Not that it’s an easy process and Glass admits when he’s on the pitch he wants to be involved at the sharp end, doing the things that help win games.“I like to create chances and I really love to get shots in on the goal, it’s what my game is about.“I’m an attacking player and I like to excite but you can’t always do that and sometimes it is about keeping things simple and doing it for the team.”As those words show, this is a young man who does not lack confidence in his own ability but he’s also one who gives an honest assessment of his performances.For instance, while he was delighted to have played his part in a young United line-up that battled back from two goals down to beat St Johnstone’s U/21s in the Betfred Cup on Wednesday night, he was far from completely satisfied with his work.“It was a brilliant result, all the boys worked really hard to come from two behind like we did.“Obviously, the experienced players helped us a lot but I thought the young boys, including myself, dug in and we battled and battled.“St Johnstone were no mugs and I thought they really impressed so it was good to get on top of them by the end.“I know I wasn’t at my best but, like all the boys, I dug in and helped get the result.“I was maybe trying too hard at times for the killer pass or maybe trying to shoot too early.“Sometimes things don’t come off on the park but I still worked hard and helped the team and that’s what you have to make sure you do.”As he keeps grafting towards making the breakthrough in the first team on a regular basis, Glass was delighted by the victory, not least because it means there will be further opportunities to show he is ready.“This cup is a chance to get 90 minutes and, if I’m not playing in the league, I need to get games somewhere.“If it’s in the Irn-Bru Cup it’s better for me and the other boys, because they are very competitive, like league games.“You want to win them, both teams do, and it gives you the chance to show up well.“We want to do well in it and I think we can.“I thought our fitness was a big factor against St Johnstone.“We had a hard pre-season and I think we got the benefits of that against St Johnstone because we finished the game strongly and looked the fitter team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee woman had buprenorphine","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee woman had sentence deferred for six months for her to be of good behaviour.Pamela Drysdale, 40, of Aboyne Avenue, admitted that she possessed the Class C drug buprenorphine at an address on Strathmartine Road on July 18 last year.Sheriff John Rafferty deferred sentence until February 19 next year.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7bd8878bae0.jpg ","title":"green campaign kicks off with adults walking to dundee primary schools","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA campaign to encourage more people to choose green travel options in Dundee was launched at City Square yesterday.Entitled Go Safe Dundee, the initiative saw a group of adults walking to primary schools around the city to raise awareness of the need for pupils and families to consider more sustainable transport.Parents, councillors, council officials and police all set off from City Square at 8.15am.

He says, though, coming off was just a precaution after needing surgery on the same ankle last season.He said: “It was nothing too serious. I had a shot and rolled my ankle a bit and I’ve had previous with it, so it was a bit of a worry at the time. However, a good bit of rest and the physio saw it. I’ve trained this week and it’s good. I just need to keep an eye on it.”Now would be an unfortunate time for Spence to be ruled out of action after some impressive displays in the early-season games and particularly due to the level of competition in the position now at Dens Park.“Last year there were a lot of centre-mids but again this year we’re very strong there, one of the strongest areas in the team,” he added.“I think that’s good because it keeps everyone on their toes, you can’t slack because there will be somebody else to take your place.“I believe in my ability and I’ve worked hard over the summer, worked hard in pre-season, too.“Obviously, I’ve been in the position but Glen Kamara is to come back and you’ve got Adil Nabi, Paul McGowan, Elton Ngwatala and Kharl Madianga, so there’s a lot of competition in there. I think throughout the season it will be getting rotated round and, hopefully, I can be in that team.“I think I’ve done OK so far. It’s still early but I want to keep this up through the whole season.“Last year I played well in stages and then got injured so I want to play consistently every week, play as much as I can, and obviously help the team climb the table.”And the way to do that will be to start finding the net, something Spence is adamant that’ll change soon.“I think our luck will turn around.“We have to put some of these chances away, we all know that, but the main thing is we are creating chances.“One day it is going to click, something is just missing at the moment but we all believe in the guys up front to go and do it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie dundee united have to make tannadice a fortress to win back wait and see supporters","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAfter a difficult start to the season, something approaching a feelgood factor has returned to Dundee United following victory over Queen of the South in the Championship and a dramatic success against St Johnstone’s kids in the Irn-Bru Cup.This weekend the Tangerines will attempt to build on that by chalking up another success when Partick Thistle visit on the resumption of league hostilities.As well as a chance to build on the new-found momentum, the Jags clash will also be a chance for Csaba Laszlo’s players to send out a message that Tannadice is once again becoming a place where visits are to be feared, not anticipated and relished.While the general perception regarding the failure to secure promotion to the Premiership in each of the last two seasons has been poor away form has been the main cause, there is no question too many points have been let slip at home.In all competitions, last season saw United beaten five teams on their own patch. Three of those defeats came against Inverness Caley Thistle, Morton and Queen of the South in league outings.There were also draws against Dumbarton, Inverness and Dunfermline, meaning a total of 15 points that were expected to be taken were, in fact, shipped.That proved crucial as United finished 13 points behind champions St Mirren and one adrift of second-place Livingston, meaning they kicked off at the first stage of the promotion play-offs, while Livi had the benefit of a two-week break before beating them in the semi-final.Before last week’s Irn-Bru success with a side that was a mix of kids and fringe players, and against very young opposition, there was little to suggest this season would bring an improvement.Over 90 minutes, the Tannadice outings in the Betfred Cup against Arbroath and Alloa were drawn and the opening day of league business ended in a painful 3-2 defeat against Dunfermline that saw the Pars dominate more than the final score suggested.That United must improve at home start is important, not just in terms of their promotion challenge but also economically.The new regime under chairman Mike Martin have invested in a new squad and that’s cost money, some of which they’d like to think will be recouped by fans paying at the gate to watch their team chalk up regular victories at home.Decent income has already come from season ticket sales that are now approaching the 4,000 mark and, if that’s down on previous years, it remains a number that would be the envy of many Premiership clubs.It would be no surprise, however, if that cash has already been spent on the rebuilding of the squad, making supporters who pay on turning up for games a vital source of further funds.In not buying season books, many have adopted a wait-and-see policy so far as attendance is concerned. If United are going well they will come, if not, they’ll find something else to do.That makes wins at Tannadice vital and, in fairness, despite the problems the team’s experienced there in the past 12 months, there are now some encouraging signs.United looked impressive in Dumfries and could’ve scored more than the two goals.And in new arrivals Pavol Safranko, Nicky Clark and Craig Curran, they have strikers who bring as close as anyone is going to get of a guarantee of goals.A more direct style this term should also help, though, ultimately, the proof of this pudding is going to be in the eating.Hopefully, from Saturday the fans can start getting tucked in to what becomes a regular menu of home wins.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck -

than pawlett for dels dons","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBoss Derek McInnes believes Scott Wright has the potential to be a No.10 who can cause havoc to opponents.The 21-year-old winger was switched to a more direct role through the middle behind striker Stevie May in the 4-0 Betfred Cup defeat of St Mirren.McInnes hailed Wright’s performance as “outstanding” in a first start for the Reds since a 2-1 loss to Rangers at Pittodrie on December 3 last year.With the positions on the wings currently occupied by in-form Gary Mackay-Steven and Northern Ireland international Niall McGinn, the No.10 role could be the breakthrough position for Wright.Former Dons winger Peter Pawlett faced a similar situation when he was moved into the attacking role in midfield when McGinn and Jonny Hayes were the first-choice wide players.McInnes reckons Wright can be even more effective than Pawlett, who moved to MK Dons last summer.McInnes said: “It is a role Scott can play and I have spoken to him about it.“People naturally think that when you are quick player and a ball carrier you normally get played as a winger.“Scott is good out there as well.“We all know there is a natural talent there and the ability to run at people.“However, it is a similar situation to when we first had Peter Pawlett when we came into the building five years ago.“We played Peter in the No.10 position and asked him to go and eliminate people from there.“Scott has the potential to be a better ball carrier than Peter was.“Peter had an impact on our team and I think Scott can be something similar in that role.“Against St Mirren when it worked he picked and chose his moments to come off and to go in behind.“Scott was difficult to deal with as it is hard when quick players don’t stand still and he can eliminate people.”Wright has had to wait patiently for his first start in nine months and grabbed his opportunity to shine.With chances likely to be limited out wide due to Mackay-Steven and McGinn the 21-year-old has had to adapt.The No.10 role where Wright has been charged with bursting through the middle to beat the offside trap is one Wright has played before for Scotland at U21 level.McInnes said: “I wasn’t going to single anyone out but for me Scott Wright was the pick of everybody.“He allowed others to be as good as they can be by causing St Mirren all sorts of problems.“They didn’t know whether to play high or deep and he recognised that.“Scott is more than just a ball carrier.“I didn’t have the benefit of being able to run at speed and make a decision.“That for me is the difference between good forward players that have quickness in their game but can still make those right decisions.“We played him in and about McGinn and told him to make sure he never stood still and he didn’t.“That pleases me when you see him taking on information.“His decision making for the majority of the time was right, although he didn’t get his end product with his goals.“Scott was different class.”Wright was not the only product of the Aberdeen youth Academy to impress in the 4-0 rout of St Mirren, which could easily have been double that score-line.Frank Ross, 20, , was pitched into the Reds’ starting line-up at short notice following an injury in the warm-up to Niall McGinn.McGinn sustained a calf injury but is expected to be fit for Saturday’s Premiership trip to Hibs.Ross was given the nod 20 minutes before kick off but produced an impressive performance in only his second start for Aberdeen.Striker Bruce Anderson came off the bench, as did Connor McLennan.McInnes insists the only aspect missing from Wright’s performance was a goal, although he unselfishly squared a pass for Stevie May to score when in on goal.McInnes said: “If we are being hyper critical Scott should have been running away with the match ball as he got into great areas to score.“That is the one wee thing that I am sure will be nagging away at him – that he didn’t get his goals.“But he did everything else- Scott was outstanding.“However, we should be waxing lyrical about a hat-trick for Scott.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"1500 cyclists to be given chance to cycle

defects” were found.North-east Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald has written to the Scottish Government calling for answers on whether the bypass completion date will be pushed back.But transport bosses claim the project “remains on schedule” for late autumn 2018, adding that contractor Balfour Beatty would pay for the additional costs.Mr Macdonald said: “This latest development will only reinforce concerns that the AWPR could be subject to further delay and it’s vital that the Scottish Government provide clarity on this matter.“The Scottish Government also need to be clear on the extent to which this will impact on the overall cost of the project and any implications for safety.“The bridges over the River Dee and River Don are clearly critical parts of the infrastructure of the AWPR and it is vital that the Scottish Government publishes its own assessment of the issues affecting the Don Crossing and their impact on the project as a whole.”It is understood the added costs could amount to millions – which would be met by the contractor – but Transport Scotland declined to give a figure for the works.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “The AWPR contract sets out a clear standard for the works on AWPR and the contractor is required to complete any necessary work to deliver this at no additional costs to the public purse.“Some concrete panels are being replaced after minor defects were identified as part of the rigorous quality control processes which are utilised across the project.“It is not unusual for minor defects to appear during the construction of major infrastructure projects.“The contractor will undertake the necessary remedial works, at no extra cost to the taxpayer.“There will be no safety implications for users of the AWPR, and the AWPR/B-T project remains on schedule to open to traffic by late autumn 2018.“The previous Cabinet Secretary reported the latest position with the AWPR/B-T project to parliament in March 2018 and Balfour Beatty’s interim results remain consistent with this.”Two main sections of the £745 million project – from Balmedie to Tipperty and Blackdog to Dyce – have already opened to traffic.Transport bosses said the new 7.5-mile section would benefit tens of thousands of drivers through enhanced safety, reduced congestion, improved journey time reliability and safer access to local areas and the wider

Aberdeenshire Council pledged to rebuild the station using old plans and photographs as guides.The station was finally opened by Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson who cut the ribbon on the project yesterday.He said: “I think it sends out a real signal because people have had a really rough time with the storm and the fire.“This is an iconic part of the community, reaching right back into history, but we’re bringing it up to the modern day.“A vast amount of work has been done to take it forward, to reflect the old station and what it meant to the community.“I think this will be very much welcomed by the local community.“This is a valuable community asset, and the council wanted to commit to making sure that an iconic building, and part of our history, was brought back to life for wide public enjoyment.”The station was converted to include the royal waiting room in 1886, under the express instructions of Queen Victoria.The royal family would make regular trips through Ballater on their way to nearby Balmoral Castle. The final journey for the royals through the village took place in 1965.Continuing the royal connection, a restaurant inside the station, The Carriage, was opened by the Prince’s Foundation.The charity was set up by Prince Charles, the Duke of Rothesay, to create “harmonious communities”.Robert Lovie, the deputy executive director of the Prince’s Foundation, said the station has been given the “royal seal of approval”.“The challenge was to create a feel inside like people were actually on the platform of a working station,” he said.“The duke has been kept involved throughout the process.“He can actually remember arriving at Ballater as a child on his holidays, so he has great memories of that.“He felt that it had to be done absolutely right and give the people of Royal Deeside back what they’d lost.“I think that he is very happy with how it has turned out.”Businesses are hopeful that the station, which will also include a VisitScotland tourist information hub and the newly relocated Ballater Library, will help to increase tourism.Erek Skene, the part owner of Dee Valley Confectioners, also located in Station Square, said: “Hopefully it will bring more people up to this area of the village.“It’s good for us here and for the whole village. Hopefully we’ll get a boost.”Alan Yule, the owner of A.B. Yule newsagents in the village, said: “It’s lovely, I hope it brings people to us.“It’s been a construction site for three years, so it’s been a bit of a mess, but it’s looking very lovely.”Jo Robinson, the north-east regional director for VisitScotland, said: “This centre represents one of 26 across Scotland and it allows people to come and get some information and inspiration about what to do in the area.“The centre is a real hub, they work with tourism-based businesses in the local area, so they’ll tell the centre what they’ve got going on.”Councillor Geva Blackett, who represents Ballater, said: “It’s the heart of Ballater which really makes it the heart of Deeside.“This is where visitors will come to gather information about what they can do. We’ve got an amazing library which will now be open more.“Hopefully the visitor centre will encourage people to visit the other shops and other parts of the village more.”To ensure the accuracy of the station, a conservation architect was hired, who combed through historical documents, plans and photographs to help recreate the station as it once was.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"surf group wades in to help at beach clean","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn annual celebration at a north-east harbour is to highlight the dangers of plastics in the sea.The Stonehaven Harbour Festival will take place this month, but organisers have decided to shine the spotlight on rubbish on the beach, with a special clean-up.The annual festival is organised in a joint effort by three of the seaside town’s community groups.A beach clean at the harbour will take place this Saturday from 11am with members of the public invited to help.Surfers Against Sewage, which has organised a number of beach cleans in the north-east over the last couple of years, will take part in the event.All the rubbish collected from the clean-up will be put on show at the festival on August 26.The display is intended to highlight the dangers to marine wildlife when rubbish ends up in the sea.The Stonehaven and District Rotary Club, Round Table and Lions Club will once again join forces, with this year’s theme being “Save the Sea”.Peter Newell, a founding member of the festival and member of the Rotary Club, said organisers wanted to highlight the dangers to marine life.He said: “I’m delighted that Surfers Against Sewage want to be associated with our Stonehaven Harbour Festival.“Over the years we have had a nautical theme, from pirates to Vikings, and last year Splasher the dolphin, the mascot for the open air awimming pool, opened the festival and was a great success.“During 2018 there has been much publicity in the UK and worldwide about the dangers of plastics being dumped in the sea and other debris which is harmful to marine life.“This year we have invited Splasher once again to open the festival so we all felt it appropriate to highlight the issue of plastics and the threat it poses to real-life Splashers.”The harbour festival will also have a number of stalls from community groups as well as the annual sandcastle competition.A demonstration by the RNLI will also take place at the harbour during the event.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dees forbes relishes locos test","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBanks o’ Dee co-manager Tommy Forbes is looking forward to the challenge of taking on Highland League Inverurie Locos.Dee meet the Railwaymen at Harlaw Park tonight in the first round of the Evening Express Aberdeenshire Cup.The tie was originally scheduled for August 1, but clashed with Locos’ involvement in the Irn-Bru Cup play-off round.Forbes said: “It’s still early in the season.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities. In front of the parade was musician Pat Kenny playing haunting tones on a carnyx, an Iron Age Celtic war horn.On the green there were stands selling everything from soap to artwork and woolly bunnets to garden shrubs.As well as battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations there were living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children tried their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, metalworking, woodwork, dressing up and blowing the carnyx.Children took part in the Lughnasa Games, featuring various tests of Celtic warrior skills.Brian MacLennan of Lochgilphead Community Council said: \u0026#8216The day was a massive success and I\u0026#8217ve had lots of positive feedback. Having a full programme of events in the arena as well as lots workshops for adults and youngsters to take part in throughout the day, has really made a big difference this year.\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216I would like to give a special mention to the 19th Argyll Scouts, the MS Centre and Lochgilphead Parish Church, without whom I\u0026#8217d have had no marquees, tables or chairs, and to Bluestone Gift Shop, the Grubs Up Recovery Cafe and the new Scottish Canals Steamer Terminal in Ardrishaig who all stepped in on the day before the festival with the additional funding and sponsorship that I needed to ensure the full scale festival could go ahead as planned.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217d also like to thank all the performers, providers and other contributors for making such a great day and would especially like to thank the volunteers who helped set up the site on Friday night and took everything down and away on Saturday evening.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m already thinking of ways to make the festival even bigger and better next year.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"imagination and colour at lochgilphead lego show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/08/18, 6:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA vast array of imaginative models were on display at the two-day Lochgilphead Lego Show.Lochgilphead Community Centre was the venue for the weekend of plastic brick magic on Saturday August 4 and Sunday August 5.Interactive workshops with Glasgow-based Bricks4Kids gave an insight into basic engineering using Lego, while the imagination room did exactly what the name suggests.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

They resided in the old Tower on the hill, which is now in ruins. The Govans continued in possession of Cardrona until the latter end of the seventeenth century, when it was purchased by Mr Williamson, writer in Peebles, and Town Clerk of that burgh. (Smail\u0026rsquos Guide, pp. 104-105)\nHorsburgh Castle: \u0026ldquoAccordingly, as it was then uninhabited [1775], and, from its condition, not likely to become again a family residence, he [an unnamed neighbour who wished to buy the castle] requested permission to improve it according to his taste. This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey. (Smails\u0026rsquo Guide, pp. 15 \u0026ndash 16)\nNether Horsburgh Castle: \u0026ldquo...we find that the lands of Easter Horseburgh, then called Schelynelaw, together with lands of Traquair and Innerleithen were, in 1634, in the hands of John Stewart of Traquair, who in that year was served heir to his brother Robert. The tradition in the family [Horseburgh] is that this part of the property was sold to defray the expenses of a lawsuit which had arisen between two brothers.\nAt Nether Horsburgh there are the remains of an old tower or keep, which used to be called Shillinglaw Tower. Tradition is silent respecting it, but it was probably built about the time the lands came into the possession of the Stewarts [sometime after 1550].

service.\n\u0026ldquoThere are now fewer welfare officers and they are all working across different services.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom hoping this petition will give some understanding to councillors

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":null,"title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.

Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.

One of the successful applicants last year was Lothian Autistic Society, which received \u0026pound5,000 for its East Lothian Basecamp service. This service supports children, aged 5-13, with autism and helps them develop social communication and social interaction skills through structured themed group and play sessions.  The foundation supports charities with projects which take a creative approach to fundamental issues such as education and neighbourhood improvements, economic development, youth development, local problem-solving, assistance to the disadvantaged or disabled, environmental conservation and cultural enrichment.  And it values projects that bring lasting benefits to local communities.  A spokesman said: \"While preference may be given to ideas which create a durable legacy for the community, judges will consider single events or projects of limited duration that otherwise meet the criteria.\"  Typically grants are made for substantial projects which require and merit awards of between \u0026pound5,000 and \u0026pound10,000, although applications can be for any size of grant and level of ambition.  The foundation will join with other contributors to support elements of larger projects, but prefers to be in a position of making a donation which will fund a project in its entirely or which constitutes the final instalment to complete a project.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform (although hair still looking slightly wild as she likes it), she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to (literally) beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.

Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington.

Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.

Shortly after Facebook\u0026rsquos announcement, Twitter revealed that it had also suspended 284 accounts for \u0026ldquocoordinated manipulation, many of them apparently originating from Iran.  Facebook has significantly stepped up policing of its platform since last year, when it acknowledged that Russian agents successfully ran political influence operations on Facebook aimed at swaying the 2016 presidential election.  The social network said it had not concluded its review of the material and declined to say how or why the state-backed actors were behaving the way they did. But it said it had informed the US and UK governments as well as the US Treasury and State departments because of ongoing sanctions against Iran.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a lot we don\u0026rsquot know yet, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said on a hastily called conference call with reporters on Tuesday afternoon.  Facebook said the actions to remove the pages, groups and accounts on Tuesday morning were the result of four investigations \u0026mdash three involving Iran, and one involving Russia.  The first involved a group called Liberty Front Press that set up multiple accounts on Facebook and Instagram that were followed by 155,000 other accounts.  The group was linked to Iranian state media based on website registrations, IP addresses and administrator accounts, Facebook said. The first accounts were created in 2013 and posted political content about the Middle East, the UK, and the US, although the focus on the West increased starting last year, Facebook said.  FireEye, a cyber security firm that alerted Facebook to the Liberty Front Press group, called it an influence operation apparently aimed at promoting Iranian political interests \u0026ldquoincluding anti-Saudi, anti-Israeli, and pro-Palestinian themes and support for the US-Iran nuclear deal.  US president Donald Trump withdrew the US from that agreement earlier this year.  While that group did not appear to be attempting to influence the US mid-terms, FireEye said its analysis \u0026ldquodoes not preclude such attempts being made. Several social media personas it found related to the group masqueraded as liberal US activists who supported Bernie Sanders.

A third group also operated out of Iran had as many as 813,000 followers, and also shared political content about the Middle East, the UK and US.  In all, the Iranian-linked groups spent some $12,000 in advertising and hosted 28 different events.  A fourth group that attempted to influence politics in Syria and the Ukraine was connected to sources that Facebook said the US had linked to Russian military intelligence.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore working closely with US law enforcement on this investigation, Facebook said in a blog post."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8445218.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"ban-on-third-party-kitten-and-puppy-sales-backed-by-government","story":"  Anyone buying or adopting a pet less than six months old will have to deal directly with the breeder or a rescue centre under the proposed ban.  The move aims to reduce serious health problems and socialisation issues which afflict pets kept in poor conditions by unscrupulous, profit-driven breeders.  It comes on the back of the prominent Lucy\u0026rsquos Law campaign which calls for an immediate halt to the sale of young pets by third-party commercial dealers.  Environment Secretary Michael Gove paid tribute to the campaign, saying: \u0026ldquoA ban on third-party sales will ensure the nation\u0026rsquos much-loved pets get the right start in life.  \u0026ldquoPeople who have a complete disregard for pet welfare will no longer be able to profit from this miserable trade.  A petition supporting Lucy\u0026rsquos Law has been signed by nearly 150,000 people and was debated in Parliament in May.  The consultation follows a call for evidence on the ban which ran from February to May.  Marc Abraham, of the Pup Aid campaign, said irresponsible breeders have for years used third parties to keep themselves hidden from the buying public and the proposed ban will make all breeders accountable.          .\u0026#8294@marcthevet\u0026#8297 \u0026#8294@Lucy_Cavalier \u0026#8294@michaelgove\u0026#8297 a sensational garden party today at Number 10 thrilled to hear the commitment to #Lucyslaw \u0026amp #wheresmum #end3rdpartysales we are entering a new day where the disgusting puppy farm/trade will be shut down : thrilled. \u0026#128077 pic.twitter/uxOUeiu7zd          \u0026mdash Peter Egan (@PeterEgan6) August 21, 2018  Paula Boyden, veterinary director at the Dogs Trust, welcomed the move but said additional steps were needed to safeguard the health of pets.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that to be effective, a ban needs to be supported by some key additional measures, such as regulating rehoming organisations.  \u0026ldquoThese measures will close off potential loopholes and ensure a ban is the success we all want to see.  The Kennel Club, which organises the Crufts dog show, also welcomed the potential move.  Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted that Michael Gove has announced that Defra will be issuing a consultation on an outright ban on third party sale of puppies, which is a vital step forward to tackling the cruel puppy farming industry.  \u0026ldquoWhen this policy is implemented it will stop the suffering of many dogs and send a very strong message to puppy buyers that it is never OK to see a puppy in any environment other than the one it was born and raised in, and with its mum.

It suggests that laziness can be a good strategy for ensuring the survival of individuals, species and even whole groups of species.  And although the research was based on lowly molluscs\u0026nbspliving on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, the authors believe they may have stumbled on a general principal that could apply to higher animals \u0026ndash including land-dwelling vertebrates.  The scientists carried out an extensive study of the energy needs of 299 species of extinct and living bivalves and gastropods spanning a period of five million years.  Those that had managed to escape extinction and survived to the present day tended to be \u0026ldquolow maintenance species with minimal energy requirements.  Molluscs that had gone the way of the dinosaurs and disappeared had higher metabolic rates than their still flourishing cousins.  US ecologist Professor Bruce Lieberman, who co-led the\u0026nbsp University of Kansas team, said: \u0026ldquoMaybe in the long term the best evolutionary strategy for animals is to be lassitudinous and sluggish.  \u0026ldquoThe lower the metabolic rate, the more likely the species you belong to will survive. Instead of \u0026lsquosurvival of the fittest\u0026rsquo, maybe a better metaphor for the history of life is \u0026lsquosurvival of the laziest\u0026rsquo or at least \u0026lsquosurvival of the sluggish\u0026rsquo.  The findings, reported in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, could have important implications for forecasting the fate of species affected by climate change, said the scientists.  Dr Luke Strotz, also from the University of Kansas, said: \u0026ldquoIn a sense, we\u0026rsquore looking at a potential predictor of extinction probability.  \u0026ldquoAt the species level, metabolic rate isn\u0026rsquot the be-all, end-all of extinction \u0026ndash there are a lot of factors at play. But these results say that the metabolic rate of an organism is a component of extinction likelihood.  \u0026ldquoWith a higher metabolic rate, a species is more likely to go extinct. So, it\u0026rsquos another tool in the toolbox. This will increase our understanding of the mechanisms that drive extinction and help us to better determine the likelihood of a species going extinct.  Energy consumption had a bigger impact on species that were narrowly distributed, the researchers found.  Species with a narrowly confined range were far more likely to go extinct if they had a high metabolic rate.  Molluscs were used for the study because of the huge amount of available data on living and extinct bivalve and gastropod species.  The team now plans follow-up work to see if \u0026ldquosurvival of the laziest natural selection applies to other kinds of animals.  Dr Strotz added: \u0026ldquoThere is a question as to whether this is just a mollusc phenomenon.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos some justification, given the size of this data set, and the long amount of time it covers, that it\u0026rsquos generalisable. But you need to look \u0026ndash can it apply to vertebrates? Can it apply on land?"},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8445647.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-bake-off-series-to-open-with-reference-to-judge-prue-leiths-tweet-blunder","story":"  Leith, 77, was in Bhutan when she tweeted her congratulations to Sophie Faldo, hours before the final.

However, critics argue testing five-year-olds is meaningless because levels of maturity are so different.  There have also been concerns that pupils have found the assessments stressful - partly in cases where whole classes have sat the tests against government guidance.  Joanna Murphy, chair of the National Parent Forum of Scotland (NPFS), praised the information from the assessments.  In a letter to The Herald she said: \u0026ldquoI have seen sample results ... and the information available to teachers is exceptional.  \u0026ldquoIt provides details of a child\u0026rsquos specific skills, knowledge and understanding, which enhances the teacher\u0026rsquos judgement.  However, Ms Murphy said a full understanding of the roll-out and purpose of the assessments had never been passed on to parents.  The NPFS previously suggested that letters should be sent to all P1 parents to ensure they fully understood the Scottish National Standardised Assessments.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey [Scottish Government] believed it would result in unnecessary profile raising, but as we made clear, and we are now seeing, when there is a vacuum of information it allows for fear and anxiety to spread.  \u0026ldquoWhat is of most concern is that parents are not getting the clear, balanced information they need to be able to decide whether assessment is right for their child.  \u0026ldquoThis issue is wider than the standardised assessments, it is about a repeated lack of good direct communication from schools, local authorities and Scottish Government to parents.  Tavish Scott, education spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, accused the government of \u0026ldquodeliberately confusing parents over their right to withdraw children from national testing.  Advice on whether pupils can opt out has been conflicting with some internal documents suggesting the test are not compulsory.  The most recent government statement says there is no formal legal right to withdraw - because the tests themselves are not statutory - but suggests parent should talk to their school if they want to opt out.  John Swinney, the Deputy First Minister, welcomed the view that standardised assessments could provide \u0026ldquoexceptional information.  He added: \u0026ldquoParent organisations worked with the Scottish Government to co-produce information leaflets for parents, carers and teachers about the standardised assessments which were sent to all schools last summer.  \u0026ldquoWe expect schools to communicate effectively with parents, and parents can talk to their child\u0026rsquos school at any time.  \u0026ldquoFollowing a review of the first year of assessments, we will shortly set out changes and enhancements to the system for this year, including enhanced communication with parents.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the assessments as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country. However, critics claim they are too stressful for the youngest pupils."},{"url":null,"title":"first-womens-football-game-in-europe-was-played-in-carstairs","story":"  A minister\u0027s objection to women joining in a kickabout on a Sunday in Carstairs, Lanarkshire, in 1628, saw players branded \u0027insolent\u0027.  The Rev John Lindsay condemned women and men playing football on the Sabbath as it was expected to be a religious day devoted to solemn reflection and worship.  A church document dated August 21, 1628, revealed: \"Mr John Lindsay, minister at Carstairs, having regretted the break of the Sabbath by the insolent behaviour of men and women in footballing, dancing and Barley Breaks, ordains every Brother (Minister) to labour to restrain the foresaid insolence and break of Sabbath, and to that effect to make intimation thereof into their several kirks next Sabbath day.\"  Experts believe the venue for the match was Carstairs\u0027 village green where the village\u0027s church originally stood.

Vivienne MacLaren, of Scottish Women\u0026rsquos Football, said: \"Scotland has a proud history within the women\u0026rsquos game and we are delighted to acknowledge that women\u0026rsquos football has been present in Scotland for 390 years, far longer than most people would imagine.  \"As custodians of women\u0026rsquos football in Scotland we also welcome the launch of the first seminar to be held to share ideas and develop the game in Scotland.\"  Britain\u0027s first recorded international women\u0027s football match was played in Edinburgh in May 1881.

It followed an apparently innocuous reference to Scotland\u0026rsquos role in the hunt for the elusive Higgs Boson, or \u0026ldquoGod particle, named after the Edinburgh-based physicist Sir Peter Higgs.  The phrase was dropped after a blistering report from a Brighton-based firm of media consultants, which was published yesterday on the Scottish Government website.  There was also brutal criticism of a boast in the draft campaign that Scotland had produced arguably the best James Bond in Sir Sean Connery.  That was dismissed as \u0026ldquoobtuse and \u0026ldquofacile when compared to another boast about Scotland helping to develop the world\u0026rsquos first cancer vaccine.  \u0026ldquoHow is that an achievement? was the summary of the \u0026ldquobest 007 claim.  Ministers were also told images of children could deter potential visitors.  A list of \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquots included \u0026ldquochildren put people off (avoid on holiday), and while a shot of a castle was considered essential, the advice declared \u0026ldquochildren can be a negative.  Golf was also \u0026ldquopolarising, with \u0026ldquominority appeal, and an over-familiar image of Scotland.  The 110-page \u0026ldquoinsight findings were released under Freedom of Information law.  Produced by Lucid People (UK) Ltd, they gave feedback and advice on an early version of the promotional campaign now being aimed at in North America, London and China.  A joint project by ministers, VisitScotland, Universities Scotland and Scottish Development International, the aim was to show Scotland as a great place to visit, study, work and invest.  The original plan was also to \u0026ldquokick-start an advocacy-driven movement that would lead people round the world to view Scotland \u0026ldquoas a great brand.  However the media consultants said large parts of the draft campaign, which initially considered using the slogan \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos Calling or \u0026ldquoGo Scotland, were a duds.  Messages aimed at visitors were the most successful, followed by those for businesses.  But the research found many people were left \u0026ldquoconfused, disengaged and/or irritated by efforts to build a Scottish \u0026ldquobrand, including a film featuring Austin Powers star Mike Myers.  Out of character, Mr Myers was \u0026ldquonot recognised by many of those on whom the material was tested, and the film left people struggling to understand it, \u0026ldquoeven after explanation.  The \u0026lsquobrand\u0026rsquo material was \u0026ldquounclear, \u0026ldquoself-congratulatory and too focused on the past.  When appealing to investors, ministers were advised to \u0026ldquoavoid too many \u0026lsquohigh brow\u0026rsquo science refs and not \u0026ldquoassume US target will be able to distinguish British (even European) accents.  The June 2017 findings were used to hone the campaign ahead of its launch this year, when Nicola Sturgeon declared it would \u0026ldquoinspire people to be part of Scotland\u0026rsquos future.  The report also revealed some of the image problems facing Scotland.  Among the starting perceptions in the US were \u0026ldquocastles and fog and \u0026ldquonothing to do.

The area this year has often been and packed with people, both audiences and people trying to walk, and yesterday at the Annual General Meeting of the Fringe Society, concern was raised about the conditions of the space during the festival.  The chief executive of the Fringe, Shona McCarthy, said the Mound, a man-made hill that connects the Old and the New Towns, surmounted by the Scottish National Gallery and the RSA building, would be the next public space to be revamped after significant changes were made to the Royal Mile artist performance this year.  However, how the changes will be implemented will depend on the major revamp to the National Gallery, which the National Galleries of Scotland are currently planning.  She said: \"This year we have completely reviewed the High Street, and how it looks...and I think the new stages, the accessibility platforms have been really well received.  \"I agree there is still work to be done on The Mound, and next year that will be a priority for us.  \"We need to reconsider how we manage the street performers on the Mound, there are bottlenecks, there are places that could work better for us.\"  A street performer at the AGM, Silver, said that the space was now cramped and \"a disaster\".  He blamed the National Galleries of Scotland for, several years ago, erecting railings outside the gallery buildings, reducing the amount of room, including steps, for the public to gather on.  \"Picture families sitting on those steps,\" he said.  The area at the bottom of the Playfair Steps, lined on one side by stalls, is often extremely difficult to navigate, he added.  He added: \"Think about this fence, it has destroyed the area, if you want to make it better, get rid of that.\"  A spokeswoman for the Fringe said that the changes did not mean the removal of street performers, but a performance and facility revamp similar to the one experienced on the Royal Mile.  There has been much debate this summer about the use of public space in Edinburgh during the festival.  The erection of black boards on Princes Street to shield the view of the Summer Sessions gigs in Princes Street Gardens led to controversy and their partial removal.  Oliver Davies, head of marketing at the Fringe, added: \"We\u0027ve done a lot of work on the High Street this year, one of the reasons we did not extend that to the Mound is that the National Galleries of Scotland have a long standing application to redevelop their footprint on the Mound.  \"We felt it was right to hold off, and we are still not sure what that impact might be, it will affect that space to some extent.\"  A spokesman for the National Galleries of Scotland said that the railings outside the National Gallery, while not always present, were part of its listed status.  The detail of the new revamp of the gallery will be revealed in the near future, he noted."},{"url":null,"title":"great-british-bake-off-2018-everything-you-need-to-know","story":"  When does it start?

Seaton Delaval Hall was a grand 18th century baroque \u0026ldquoparty house belonging to\u0026nbsp the flamboyant Delaval family, hosting their costume balls, elaborate practical jokes and spectacular theatrical productions.  The hall, which was partially destroyed by fire in 1822, was bought in 2009 by the National Trust, which\u0026nbspundertook much-needed conservation work.  It\u0026nbsphas recently been awarded \u0026pound3.7 million National Lottery funding for repairs and restoration, as well as moves to improve visitor facilities and bring its past to life.  An ecology survey carried out to assess whether it was possible to install new art and visitor information in the central hall of the building revealed the presence of more than 60 bats \u0026ndash with more thought to be hidden in crevices.  The National Trust\u0026rsquos head of nature conservation David Bullock also expressed surprise the pipistrelles were choosing to roost in light and dry crevices, as he said most bats like cool, moist and dark hibernation sites.  Bats have made their home at Seaton Delaval for many years, believed to have first come to roost in the hall after it was ravaged by fire in 1822 and left exposed to the elements for more than 40 years.  The installation of a new roof in the later 19th century made the space warmer and drier but still allowed bats access through crevices in the stonework.  Tina Wiffen, bat ecologist, said: \u0026ldquoWe discovered the bats when we were undertaking an ecological survey to assess the possibility of introducing new art and visitor information installations into the central hall of the building \u0026ndash a project being supported by the National Lottery.  \u0026ldquoOn finding the bats, we conducted a formal survey and at least 60 bats were counted in February and 61 in early March \u0026ndash with more visits then needed for verification.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos likely that even more bats are here, hidden in deeper crevices.  \u0026ldquoAs a result the site will now be even more closely managed and monitored to ensure that the bats can continue to use the hall as their winter roost.  Mr Bullock recently visited the hall to verify the findings, and said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never encountered hibernating pipistrelles in such numbers before.  \u0026ldquoThe cavities in the stones in Seaton Delaval Hall\u0026rsquos central hall provide one of the few known hibernation sites of what could be hundreds of bats.  \u0026ldquoMost bats like cool, moist and dark hibernation locations.\u0026nbsp In contrast, the pipistrelles residing in the central hall were in light and dry crevices.  The National Trust said it will use some National Lottery funding for further surveying work to learn more about how the bats use the hall so it can protect the pipistrelles before any of the planned repair work starts later this year."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-to-create-thousands-of-apprenticeships","story":"  The fast food chain said the move is part of its Youth Opportunity Programme, a new initiative to reduce barriers to employment for two million young people by 2025.

Facebook has significantly stepped up policing of its platform since last year, when it acknowledged that Russian agents successfully ran political influence operations on Facebook aimed at swaying the 2016 presidential election.  The social network said it had not concluded its review of the material and declined to say how or why the state-backed actors were behaving the way they did. But it said it had informed the US and UK governments as well as the US Treasury and State departments because of ongoing sanctions against Iran.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a lot we don\u0026rsquot know yet, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said on a hastily called conference call with reporters on Tuesday afternoon.  Facebook said the actions to remove the pages, groups and accounts on Tuesday morning were the result of four investigations \u0026mdash three involving Iran, and one involving Russia.  The first involved a group called Liberty Front Press that set up multiple accounts on Facebook and Instagram that were followed by 155,000 other accounts.  The group was linked to Iranian state media based on website registrations, IP addresses and administrator accounts, Facebook said. The first accounts were created in 2013 and posted political content about the Middle East, the UK, and the US, although the focus on the West increased starting last year, Facebook said.  FireEye, a cyber security firm that alerted Facebook to the Liberty Front Press group, called it an influence operation apparently aimed at promoting Iranian political interests \u0026ldquoincluding anti-Saudi, anti-Israeli, and pro-Palestinian themes and support for the US-Iran nuclear deal.  US president Donald Trump withdrew the US from that agreement earlier this year.  While that group did not appear to be attempting to influence the US mid-terms, FireEye said its analysis \u0026ldquodoes not preclude such attempts being made. Several social media personas it found related to the group masqueraded as liberal US activists who supported Bernie Sanders.

A third group also operated out of Iran had as many as 813,000 followers, and also shared political content about the Middle East, the UK and US.

Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Wednesday 22 Aug 2018 7:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Wednesday 22 Aug 2018 7:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, estimates the challenge should take him around three hours. He had been due to attempt the swim earlier this summer, with another swimmer, but they had to cancel due to poor weather conditions.Speaking this morning he said: \u0026#8220As a surfer, I never thought I would be so glad to see flat-calm sea conditions.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”   \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Made with footage culled from up to 240 cameras that captured both the initial launch and the nine-day mission that followed, the film is a vital scientific document, a portrait of late \u0026#821760s America and a visually cogent exploration of man\u0026#8217s place in the universe.With an original score by Charles Morrow and a commanding narration by Laurence Luckinbill, the documentary won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival. However, for the next few decades, it was practically forgotten even the original printing elements were lost.Christopher Riley is a film producer, director and writer specialising in science, engineering and history. His work has been celebrated by BAFTA, the US Television Academy, the Royal Television Society, the Sundance Institute and the Grierson Trust.He is a regular contributor to  newspaper and presents science documentaries for BBC Radio 4. In 2007 he tracked down Theo Kamecke — who was working as a sculptor in upstate New York — and found that he held the only remaining 35mm print. Working closely with Theo, Moonwalk One was re-mastered, combining a unique 35mm director’s cut with newly transferred 16mm NASA flight film media, to create a new HD digital master of the film.This will be the first chance to see the new high-definition Blu-ray version of the film which is due to be released next year.Moonwalk One: The Director\u0026#8217s Cut is on at West Side Cinema, Stromness Town Hall, Saturday, September 8 at 7.45pm.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She has it all.\"I would definitely say she is the best that I have ever had.\"She has strong flat bones in her legs, the hock is nice and high in her hind legs, her second thigh is nice and short, and she has a good deep body and good long silky hair covering her legs and the back of her hooves.\"And she\u0026rsquos good natured too, they generally are.\"The plant fitter, who works for Macdonald Groundworks, has been breeding his own Clydesdale horses for more than 30 years, following in the footsteps of his father and his grandfather, Donald Clarke, who worked on farms with the horses and took a stallion around the area.Mr Johnstone said: \"We also have Ord Tinkerbell\u0026rsquos full sister Ord Destiny and her mother Ord Envy.\"We keep them on a bit of rented ground. We just have them for showing and breeding.\"It\u0026rsquos a hobby, a very expensive one, but we try not to count it up.\"There\u0026rsquos quite a lot of work in it too, but it\u0026rsquos worth it,\" he added.Wednesday 22 Aug 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The 3.6km section between Glendoe and Loch Tarff has been particularly challenging and would not have been possible without funding support from SSE, Highland Council and the Scottish Government and European Union totalling \u0026pound250,000, as well as the full support from Glendoe Estate over whose land the trail has been constructed. The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added. We know from feedback that there is already substantial interest from key European markets, particularly Germany, and VILN hope by spring 2019 to confidently go out to markets and promote it.

Her cooking was what initially drew clients to come to the centre and her baking, he said, was \"legendary\".This theme was echoed by speeches from Ina Mackenzie, Mina Stewart and Kerry Watson. Laela Maclean composed a poem which reminisced and poked good-natured fun at Cis\u0026rsquos life in Lochcarron and the Centre.Cis\u0026rsquos husband Sandy kept the feet tapping with musical interludes on his accordion \u0026mdash including one tune called Christine Ross of Lochcarron, initially written for Cis by the late Iain Crichton, from Stornoway.Christine Houser, Donar MacIver and his son, Stephen MacIver sang Gaelic songs \u0026mdash the eyes of some of the older guests lighting up as they joined in the choruses.Cis was aided by Morag MacCuish to cut her retirement cake which had been made by Harry Gow, her favourite baker. She made a speech thanking everyone for their presence and for the gifts she had received from the clients, staff and board members.The event provided a lovely send-off for Cis. The afternoon ended with everyone joining hands to sing Auld Lang Syne accompanied musically, as in life, by her husband Sandy.Wednesday 22 Aug 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Hopes for a visitor trail around an area that was heavily militarised during WWII are now full steam ahead after the project team behind the Aultbea museum secured almost \u0026pound73,000 from the Scottish Land Fund towards the purchase of a former butcher\u0026rsquos shop it has been renting to house the display.People from 19 countries outside the UK were amongst the 5500-plus visitors dropping in between May and October last year and that number is set to mushroom as the facility is improved and plans for a wider trail developed.The project\u0026rsquos chairman Francis Russell told the Journal: \"To some extent we have become masters of our own destiny. This opens up new avenues of funding. The location on the NC500 is very important.\"We ask people when they come in how they heard about us and some say it was while they were driving by. It puts us on the map. We\u0026rsquoll look at the feasibility and cost of a major refurbishment and possibly an extension. We could do with much more space.\"Fellow project volunteer Elizabeth Miles said the boost \"will allow us to get on to develop it the way we would like\".She said: \"Owning the site will open new possibilities. We will look to create a WWII trail where everywhere gets visited. We\u0026rsquore hoping to really do something with it.\"Research found the NC500, which passes the makeshift museum, brought 29,000 extra visitors in its first year, adding an extra \u0026pound9m to the Highland economy.The \u0026pound72,820 award will contribute towards the purchase of the former butcher\u0026rsquos shop and surrounding land.Honorary president of the RACP George Milne said the aim is to create a multi-site museum for current and future generations to learn about the convoys.He said: \"The overall aim is to establish a unique multi-site museum in Wester Ross. Around Loch Ewe we hope to create a permanent exhibition centre, a WWII Trail with interpretation panels, a memorial garden, and the preservation of selected wartime buildings to honour all who served in the Arctic convoys to and from Russia from 1941-1945.\"\u0026nbspThe 75th anniversary of the last convoy to sail from the area will be marked in 2020, with relatives of servicemen and visitors from around the world expected to come in their droves.Gairloch Heritage Museum, which itself secured backing from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for a \u0026pound2m project to convert the old anti-aircraft operations room in the centre of the village into a state of the art new facility, welcomed the news.It said: \"Congratulations to our friends at Russian Arctic Convoy Museum on procuring the funds to purchase their exhibition centre.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Wednesday 22 Aug 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down.

One burst in May at 5am cut off half of Tain.\"Councillor Alasdair Rhind voiced frustration over the pace of the clean-up and wants Scottish Water to replace a substantive length of pipe to combat a repeat. He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Wednesday 22 Aug 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

According to The Office for National Statistics, the number of Scots aged 16 to 64 who are in employment rose by 17,000 to a working-age rate of 75.2 per cent.                However, for employers looking to expand and recruit, this trend brings additional challenges as the pool of job seekers shrinks. So, how do employers make themselves more attractive to potential employees? I believe the answer lies in building their brand as an employer.            A few weeks ago, Mactaggart and Mickel Homes achieved something that no other Scottish housebuilder has done, and which only one other UK housebuilder has accomplished. We were awarded Investors in People (IIP) Platinum accreditation, the highest level which can be achieved. Only 2 per cent of IIP-accredited organisations in the UK – 78 companies – have attained this standard.            As a director of Mactaggart and Mickel Homes with responsibility for human resources, I welcome this recognition. But, the truth is, we didn’t set out to gain IIP Platinum. Our objective was, and remains, to be an employer of choice. Gaining IIP Platinum tells me that we are heading in the right direction – but the journey is not over. In fact, it should be a lifelong journey for all responsible employers who wish to recruit the best talent. How do you become an employer of choice? There is no set formula, but here are four areas that have proved to be instrumental for Mactaggart and Mickel Homes.Firstly, give your staff a voice. Make a sustained effort not only to listen to what your people are saying, but be prepared to act on that advice. Mactaggart and Mickel have Employer of Choice champions across the business – our eyes and ears, if you like – and we also hold regular “spotlight” lunches where employees discuss ideas with our CEO. One suggestion was to introduce a charity volunteering programme so staff can make a real difference using their varied skill sets. We plan to launch this programme in the autumn.Secondly, identify your future leaders. We have an emerging leaders’ programme which brings together talented people to hone their skills by addressing a specific business challenge, most recently looking at customer service before, during and after a home purchase. In fact, the changes we implemented as a result of their work were a key factor in us achieving a five star rating from the Home Builders Federation for the sixth year in a row. This is voted for by the people who buy our properties, so it means a great deal to us.Thirdly, think continuous improvement. It’s tempting to pay less attention to the areas of your business that are performing well. Management focus tends to be drawn towards the challenges and how to overcome them. But, to become an employer of choice, you need to be able to show improvement across the high performing areas, too. It’s about being fit for purpose next week, next year and in ten years’ time.                Finally, plan for sustainable growth. Quick wins are welcome, but IIP assessors and potential recruits are looking for something more evidence that business strategies are robust and taking the business forward. Our expansion into the English housebuilding marketplace was a landmark strategy for us and, together with our continued diversification into new markets such as the private rental sector, has been key to us being able to showcase our progress to our teams.There’s no silver bullet that will ensure that the brightest talent chooses to join your business rather than your competitors. But committing to programmes such as Investors in People is a good place to start on your own journey to be the employer that everyone wants to work for.Marion Forbes, director at Mactaggart and Mickel Homes."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4787626.1534875499!/image/image.jpg","title":"menzies campbell democracy demands a second brexit referendum","story":"        There are just a few months left to sort out the mess that the Westminster Government has made of Brexit but calls are getting louder across the UK \u0026#8211 and especially in Scotland \u0026#8211 for the people to be given a democratic final say before we leave the EU.                A recent big poll of Scottish opinion showed our nation supports the demand for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal by a margin of 48 to 31 per cent.             And if we get that referendum, Scotland would vote to stay in the EU by an even bigger majority than we did before – 66 to 34 per cent.            This shows why we, the people of Scotland, should be allowed to take back control of the process we started in the referendum of June 2016.As a Liberal Democrat MP who represented a Scottish seat at Westminster for 28 years, I unequivocally support a People’s Vote, since Brexit is the biggest issue facing our country in a generation.The SNP’s current voters want to stay in the EU by a margin of 83 to 17 per cent, while they back a People’s Vote on Brexit by a margin of more than four-to-one - 66 to 18 per cent, once ‘don’t knows’ have been removed. Labour’s current supporters in Scotland would vote to stay in the EU by a margin of 74 to 26 per cent and support a People’s Vote by 64 to 21 per cent.READ MORE: Poll: Only a quarter of Brits back Theresa May over Brexit            The public view on Brexit is shifting and it is incumbent on all of us from across the political spectrum who believe in democracy to come out on one side or the other of this crucial debate in our history.This includes all political parties, including those with large mandates both at Holyrood and at Westminster. In history, our leaders will be judged on their actions today, not their warm words, when it comes to the fight for a People’s Vote on the final deal.Two years on from the 2016 referendum, we find ourselves in a position where the promises made by those cheerleading the Brexit campaign are neither being met nor are likely to be, as the Government and its Brexiteer stalwarts desperately try to convince themselves that Brexit, as promised by the Leave campaign, can actually be implemented.We will end up paying a £50 billion-plus divorce settlement for a worse relationship with our EU partners than the one which we enjoy today.             We will enter a 21-month transition period from 30 March next year onwards, where not only will we have to implement all EU rules and laws but we will have no say over them. We risk losing control over the Northern Irish border where Brexit raises real concerns that the troubles of the past could rear their ugly head again.READ MORE: SNP warns no-deal Brexit leaves Scottish economy facing devastationAs for the Brexit Cheerleaders, they have either dodged cabinet responsibility – as in the cases of Boris Johnson and David Davis – or they have looked to remove themselves from the mess they have created.

Dr Catherine Calderwood, Scotland’s chief medical officer, said the NHS was working to “ensure that there are enough medicines for us in Scotland” in a no-deal scenario, including plans to secure supplies of “problematic” medical products from the EU.            Her comments came as a leaked email from health providers to the head of the NHS in England warned of a lack of adequate contingency planning in the health service south of the Border.            UK Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab met the EU’s chief negotiator in Brussels yesterday and agreed to move into “continuous negotiation” in a bid to resolve the continuing deadlock on issues, including the Irish border and trade.With the stakes rising as time runs out to reach an agreement, Michel Barnier insisted the EU was not responsible for the growing risk of no deal, suggesting Brussels was “not impressed” by what he called a brewing “blame game” in the UK.A breakthrough in time for an EU summit in October now seems unlikely, after Mr Barnier said a deal was needed “well before the end of the year … [around the] beginning of November, but not much later than that”.Mr Raab said publication of the first batch of technical papers on preparations and advice for a no-deal Brexit would contradict some of the “hair-raising scare stories” circulating about the impact of talks in Brussels failing.And last night he said EU residents living in the UK would not be “turfed out” even if an agreement with Brussels on citizens rights was not signed.            UK government contingency plans are reported to set out how parts of the UK furthest from the main ports in the south-east of England, including Scotland, could run low on food and medicine within days without a Brexit deal.Speaking to the BBC, Dr Calderwood said: “We have some very detailed plans, a report of what might be problematic to access, and we will be working again very closely with the Department of Health to ensure that there are enough medicines for us in Scotland.”She revealed NHS Scotland would need its own stockpiles of some medical supplies in the event of a no-deal Brexit, adding: “The plans that we have discussed involve ensuring that there is a supply of medicines. That will mean having those available within the UK, and particularly us in Scotland having our own supplies. So if there is a problem with ferry and air freight and the border we already have the medication, we already have the intravenous fluids and the equipment already in the country for the use of our patients in the NHS in Scotland.”In an email to the chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens, the head of the organisation representing hospital, community health and ambulance trusts in England warned “public health and disease control co-ordination could suffer” in a no-deal Brexit. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said leaving the EU without an agreement would affect “the entire supply chain of pharmaceuticals” as well as the NHS workforce, which relies heavily on European nationals.            The leaked email warned the risk of a Brexit “with minimal regulatory alignment [with the EU] appears to be growing” and that preparation work “is being hampered by the lack of visible and appropriate communication” from NHS England leadership.In Brussels, Mr Barnier said it was still possible for the EU and the UK to find “common ground” based on Theresa May’s Chequers plan, but insisted Brussels would not compromise on the core principles of the single market.“Why would we? The UK is leaving the European Union, it is not the other way around,” he told reporters.“The European Union is based on principles and values, on rules. It is a whole eco-system, which is integrated of rules and laws and standards, of supervision and of certification ... which the UK knows very, very well because we built it together, didn’t we?”“We have been building it over some 40 or so years together. So those principles will remain our principles because that is the way it is.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4787670.1534881638!/image/image.jpg","title":"parents face going back to class in bid to help children","story":"        Parents could be encouraged to take refresher classes in key subjects such as maths to help their children learn at home, according to a new Scottish Government blueprint.                There will also be a drive to get more parents volunteering in schools as part of a new national plan for families to get more involved in the education system.            Deputy First Minister John Swinney says the push can help drive up standards in classrooms and reduce the attainment gap between affluent and less well off parts of the country. But opponents warned that parents must not be used to “pick up the slack” for teacher shortages and cuts to resources.            Scotland’s first national plan to get parents involved with their youngsters’ education was published yesterday.The plan aims to target fathers to ensure they play a pivotal role in helping their children learn amid concerns the existing approach is passing them by.But a key stumbling block for getting parents involved in helping youngsters with their schooling is that \u2028many find maths and numeracy “intimidating”, the plan states.Schools are already providing help for parents to tackle this.“Drop-in classroom sessions, tailored classes on numeracy learning for parents, numeracy cafes, bedtime maths sessions, video and social media updates and evening sessions at school with pizza and hot chocolate are all common methods employed,” the publication states.            Education Scotland is now to work with parents’ groups to promote such good practice and back the role of parents in assisting their child’s learning.A similar approach will be taken to get more parents volunteering at schools, with a working group being established by ministers to see how this can be made easier.It points to the success of a programme in North Ayrshire where the “Wee Family” scheme got parents involved in helping their youngsters learn French, including going into the classroom one afternoon a week.The Action plan has 50 recommendations and sees parents playing a more hands-on role in the life of schools, including a say in the recruitment of staff.            The report was welcomed by opposition parties, who back formal recognition of the role of parents in children’s education.“Some of these proposals will not only help children’s learning, but also be of benefit to the parents,” Scottish Conservative shadow education secretary Liz Smith said.“But it’s clear this cannot be allowed to develop into a situation where parents are picking up the slack for teacher \u2028shortages and financial challenges.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4787661.1534881200!/image/image.jpg","title":"sturgeon playing to the gallery over catalan visit","story":"        Nicola Sturgeon is facing accusations of \u0026#8220playing to the Nationalist gallery\u0026#8221 after it emerged she has agreed to visit Catalonia in a boost to its push for independence from Spain.                The SNP leader accepted an invitation to go to the autonomous region in the north-east of Spain as she met the Catalan president Quim Torra during talks at Bute House earlier this year.            SNP MPs have backed Catalonia’s right to hold an independence referendum and Ms Sturgeon has led the widespread criticism of the Madrid government’s hardline approach to blocking the regional government from staging a vote on leaving the Spanish state last year.            The proposed visit to Barcelona, the Catalan capital, emerged in the minutes of a meeting between the First Minister and Mr Torra at the First Minister’s Bute House residence last month, with a date expected to be set in the coming weeks.But the proposed trip came under fire from Tory MSP Jackson Carlaw.“As First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon has become utterly side-tracked playing to the Nationalist gallery,” he said.“It now appears she intends to do that abroad as well as at home. If this is simply a political visit between two separatist parties, there can be no justification for Scottish taxpayers meeting the tab. It should come out of the SNP’s own coffers.”​Ties between the Nationalist movements in Scotland and Catalonia have strengthened over the past year after the case of Clara Ponsati, the St Andrews University professor who was part of the Catalan administration that called the independence referendum last year.             This was thwarted by a hardline crackdown by Madrid last year and Prof Ponsati faced extradition to Spain on charges of rebellion and abusing public funds. Spanish judges later threw out the case against her and the extradition case was dropped. Ms Sturgeon’s meeting with Mr Torra was to discuss the case before the resolution.The minutes of the Bute House event, released under Freedom of Information laws, said the two leaders discussed the “challenging and complex situation” in Catalonia.            “They agreed that the way forward for Catalonia must be through peaceful and democratic solutions involving dialogue between the Spanish and Catalan authorities, respecting the right to self-determination of the Catalan people.“The president extended an invite to the First Minister to visit Barcelona. The First Minister indicated she would be delighted to do so.”The Barcelona visit was confirmed by a spokeswoman for the Catalan government, who said there were hopes to fix a date after the summer recess in Catalonia. She said: “It’s true that the last meeting between President Torra and the First Minister was a warm meeting and they agreed on a lot of issues and there was a good relationship between them. The aim [of the visit] is to strengthen that.”A Scottish Government spokesperson said: “The First Minister had a productive meeting with President Torra and we will look towards opportunities to work together in the future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?

It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"various apprenticeships ","story":" Radar Technician – SERCO – Unst\nApprenticeship vacancies are open to male and female applicants, candidates over age 25 will be considered for some vacancies.\nWages vary dependent on employer.

Tourism makes a critical contribution to the local economy, and indeed the wider Scottish economy, and indirectly enables people to live, work and raise a family on the island.\n“As such, we write to categorically assert that Skye and Raasay is well and truly open for business.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"highland exodus to stirling as runrig get set for final","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nAfter 45 years, Runrig will bring the curtain down on a remarkable musical career this weekend when they play their last ever shows.\nAn exodus of west Highland and islanders will be among the throng at Stirling’s City Park in the shadow of the town’s famous castle this Friday and Saturday.\nThey will be there to enjoy and celebrate one final time with a band which owes its roots to Skye and North Uist, and became an international flag bearer for Gaeldom’s language and tradition.\nSpeaking to the Free Press ahead of the ‘Last Dance’ shows, guitarist Malcolm Jones said he held conflicting feelings but there was excitement none the less at a final performance which will chart over four decades of music.\nHe added: “I would say we’re all approaching these final concerts with mixed emotions. There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27431  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nIrish Unity makes sense.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary (better known as ‘Nana’) Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

The party’s spokesperson for Business, Enterprise andInnovation Maurice Quinlivan TD has announced proposals to increase the numberof people in apprenticeships to 60,000 by 2023, whilst also branding thecurrent government’s reform plans as “unambitious, uninspiring and unacceptablyslow”.\nThe document outlines Sinn Féin’s proposals to reform the system in ways suchas trebling the number of apprenticeship programmes currently availablealongside focusing on plans to increase the female \u0026amp people withdisabilities participation rates within the programmes. \nDeputy Maurice Quinlivan said\n “Thegovernment is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming theapprenticeship system.

The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning. Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives.

She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward. Young people, especially can access our services quite quickly so we would really encourage them to come forward.”\nIf you think you might benefit from talking to New Life, call 90 391630.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tribute call for elisha scott","story":"\n\nTHE\n public vote to name the new road leading to the Olympia Leisure Centre in Belfast is in its final week and SDLP Councillor Donal Lyons is encouraging people to ensure they have their say and to vote for \u0026#8216Elisha Scott Boulevard\u0026#8217.\n\nElisha Scott is a Liverpool football legend and was Belfast Celtic’s most successful manager who also took the club on their tour of the US in 1949 where they defeated the then British champions, Scotland.\n\nCllr Donal Lyons said: “The vote to name this new road closes on this Sunday and the 125th anniversary of Elisha Scott’s birth will be on the 24th of this month, just days after. \n\n“I’m glad that my proposal to name this road after Elisha Scott has been included because despite Elisha being one of the most successful footballers to have come from our city, awareness of his achievements has faded. \n\n“It’s my hope, that by naming this road after Elisha Scott that we can correct this and begin to give him the full and long overdue recognition he deserves.”\n\nGoalkeeper Scott was born just yards from this new road. Cllr Lyons said it It would be fitting if the road was named after one of Belfast’s greatest ever footballers.\n\n“After famously signing for Liverpool FC in 1912 for ‘£1 and the price of the boat trip’, Scott would be a key player in Anfield for an incredible 22 years, making 468 first-team appearances. He holds the record as Liverpool’s longest serving player to this day. The earliest recorded football chant was Liverpool fans cheering his name. Scott is widely considered the first King of the Kop. \n\n“But it’s not just his time in Liverpool that’s worthy of celebrating. Elisha returned to the Donegall Road in 1934 to become player-manager for Belfast Celtic. Over the following 14 years, he would secure 31 trophies with the Grand Old Team, including 10 Irish League titles, six Irish Cups and eight Gold Cups. Belfast Celtic were the powerhouse in local football and the club still retains a loyal and dedicated fan base. \n\n“Scott also knew what mattered in football and when challenged amid worsening sectarian tensions in the 1930s, for fielding a cross community team he responded in his trademark forthright style, ‘I don’t play Protestant players. I don’t play Catholic players.

The gridlock has been caused by the introduction of bus lanes in the area.\n\nThe Department for Infrastructure said it was concerned that the congestion would affect the operation of the Glider service which is due to be introduced next month.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"Improved bus priority measures are critical to the delivery of the new Glider service in the Harbour Estate.\n\n\"As the increased traffic delays currently being experienced would also affect the operation of the Glider service, it has been decided to amend the bus priority measures in the area. \n\n\"These changes involve suspending the city-bound bus lane on Sydenham Road opposite the SSE Arena from Tuesday and introducing, in the coming days, an additional section of city-bound bus lane on Queen\u0027s Road, north of the junction at the Titanic building.\"\n\nThe department said it will be it will be working with Belfast Harbour and other partners in Titanic Quarter over the coming months to introduce new measures to enable the Sydenham Road bus lane to be reintroduced.\n\nThe spokesman added: \"Translink will also be engaging with local businesses to encourage greater use of public transport and of walking and cycling where appropriate.\n\n\"At peak times, the road network in Titanic Quarter is at full capacity or over capacity. With the potential for new development, the number of cars on our roads is likely to continue to grow and public transport and active travel are a key part of the solution to the problems that gives rise to.\"\n\nLast week Belfast Harbour said a new interim relief road would also be introduced linking Queen\u0027s Road and Sydenham Road at peak evening times. It is understood this measure will be introduced on Wednesday or Thursday. \n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37235497.ece/01414/AUTOCROP/w620h342/pe_Francis_wave%208.jpg","title":"gail walker why declining invite to meet pope is missed opportunity for unionist leaders","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

This is a major world leader, one of the handful of personalities whose opinion matters across the globe, whose undoubted authority transcends economic, military, racial, cultural and even religious categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nOther leaders take his opinion into account. Institutions such as the United Nations and NATO attend to his views. Vladimir Putin listens with respect. Leaders of other Christian traditions, be it via Luther or Calvin or Knox, offer the esteem due to his spiritual role as well as the clear piety and humility his character has shown.\n\n\n \nPope in Ireland: DUP has shot itself in foot by snubbing invite, insists Catholic UUP councillor\n \n\n \nPope in Ireland: Why meeting Francis would have been an easy gig for Arlene Foster\n \n\n\nObviously, a sustained engagement here on this island is of huge consequence.\n\nAnd, of course, as the leader of world Catholicism, his presence in Ireland will have vast added importance for his co-religionists here, who have seen their values apparently recede from the position of self-assurance they once occupied.\n\nNone of this is to mitigate the scale of the crisis in which the Catholic Church finds itself, in the face of scandalous abuses of trust, most recently in Australia and the US, but of persistent relevance on this island. Catholic institutions here (from hospitals to schools and care homes, even to the daily social standing of clergy and nuns) have been run down, ridiculed, often closed and discredited.\n\nFrequently, its clergy have been arrested and convicted of child abuse and other crimes.\n\nBut none of that, in turn, can diminish the significance of this cultural moment.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing surprising about the various moral stances which the Catholic Church has adopted on issues, from contraception to abortion to same-sex marriage. Those views are of very long-standing.\n\nThey may be unsupported now by legislation around the globe, they may be in the minority in most countries, certainly in Ireland itself as tested by referenda.\n\nBut they cannot be considered unprecedented or new. They are still intrinsic to the Catholic faith.\n\nThe Catholic Church has shown no more inclination to alter its teaching on these issues in the face of legislative change than it has in relation to the position of women in the Church or any of the many other doctrines and beliefs it promulgates as part of its unique ‘faith package’.\n\nThe severe criticisms of the Church come as vocally from inside as from outside.\n\nBut criticism from outside has become much more strident and bullish in recent decades. The old fear of being thought ‘anti-Catholic’ — which may not have held such sway in parts of Northern Ireland or indeed Britain, as it may have done in other parts of Europe — has also receded and there is renewed confidence in parodying ‘Catholic values’ and lampooning the Pope, as well as the characterisation even of the expression of traditional Catholic doctrines as being equivalent to ‘hate speech’.\n\nThese are amazing days, replete with irony. Sentiments which, until recently, would only have been found on gable ends in Belfast, now are scrawled on placards at public events in Dublin.\n\nFrankly offensive slogans that would have marked out individuals in Belfast as blatant sectarians and bigots and had them shot, punched or frogmarched to the barracks, now routinely pepper the discourse on social media of Irish people who have been no closer to Belfast than watching Carl Frampton on BT Sport or listening to Snow Patrol.\n\nMany of the people who would still instinctively bridle at the idea that the partition of Ireland in 1921 was a ‘good thing’ because it limited the bailiwick of a rapacious and corrupt Church with designs on schools and care and children’s homes — Home Rule is Rome rule’ — now find themselves seeking zealously to uncouple health and education from the control of that very Church, but almost a hundred years too late.\n\nIt was heartening to hear that Presbyterian Moderator Dr Charles McMullen is to attend the state reception for the Pope in Dublin, saying his Church “recognised that this papal visit would bring great joy to our Roman Catholic neighbours and friends, and it was something we wanted to welcome”.\n\nMaybe it’s just bad timing all-round but it’s regrettable that the leaders of the two unionist political parties in Northern Ireland declined their invitations to attend the Pope’s speech. The leader of the Alliance Party has other commitments also. The UUP and Alliance are each sending someone but the DUP can find no one at all to make this trip.\n\nIt’s clear that the dismay which has greeted this news has already meant that yet another opportunity has been missed to build bridges, reach out, heal divisions, change mindsets, alter perspectives, modify attitudes, correct misunderstandings or fix mistakes. Call it what you like — whatever it is you want to call that gesture of goodwill — it has been let slip yet again.\n\nOne wonders, after the hundreds already side-stepped, how many opportunities for making that crucial difference are actually left to us now?\n\nLeaving aside the obvious current social issues with political impacts on which Ulster Protestantism of whatever stripe finds common ground with Irish Catholicism, there is a clear benefit to be gained by unionism in putting into practice what it so often states is its core secular message: the attraction of the Union is for all people regardless of creed.\n\nAs has been stated in this newspaper, the strength of the Union can only be enhanced by the visible benefits of it to a population now only by a fraction in the minority. An important part of that benefit would be the clear, simple respect of unionism for the faith of that population.\n\nIt doesn’t matter that church attendances are declining or that many Catholics are at odds with the Church on this or that issue, or even that some of those at the papal Mass in Dublin will have voted Yes in the recent referendum on same-sex marriage or even abortion.\n\nWhat matters is that unionism is regarded as principled, yes, but also modern, nuanced, accommodating, mature, hospitable, and no longer perceived as simply knee-jerk hostile to Catholic ritual.\n\nNo more Old Red Socks, no more No Pope Here.\n\nCertainly, not among our MPs in Westminster, thanks. Not among our MLAs in Stormont.\n\nIt is a matter of fact in our day that unionism is no enemy of Catholics.\n\nIt still believes it is the best guarantor of prosperity and equality for all.\n\nIt should still be possible for that message to be conveyed in person to the pontiff in Dublin at the weekend.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"manager helps deliver baby boy at belfast shopping centre","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There was one last big push, her waters broke and out came the little baby. It was beautiful, talk about the miracle of life. It was absolutely amazing. I was a bit emotional.\"\n\nThe paramedic wrapped the baby in towels before handing the little boy to his mother.\n\nMs Coulter said: \"It was a little boy. By this time some of her relatives had gathered outside so we could hear everybody yo hoing and having a big celebration, shouting \u0027Connswater baby\u0027 outside, so that brought a bit of lightness to it.\n\n\"It was such a lovely experience.\"\n\nThe assistant manger said she hoped to see Nicole and her baby boy come back to the centre to visit staff.\n\nShe added: \"I got to cuddle the baby before the ambulance took the baby and mother away.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"woman remanded in custody accused of having sword in public","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In 2017, that number dropped by 18.7% to 6,367. \n\nWexford, Meath and Dublin saw the smallest decline in publican’s licences. Wexford pubs dropped from 158 to 157 while Meath was down three pubs from 210 to 207.\n\nIn 2017, there were 773 pubs registered in Dublin city and county – down only 1.7% from 786 in 2005. \n\n\nThe drinks industry employs 90,000 people. When tourism is included, much of which is associated w/ drinks \u0026 hospitality, employment is 254,400, or 11.5% of all Irish jobs \n#SYL18\n\nSign the petition to support Ireland\u0027s drinks, hospitality \u0026 tourism sectors: \nhttps://t.co/tJLlMgHKBv\n \npic.twitter/VTi99dwVXg\n\n— Drinks Industry Group of Ireland (@DIGI_Ireland) \nAugust 13, 2018\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the number of Dublin pubs in 2017 is 4.7% higher than in 2012 – the lowest year for the number of pubs in Dublin.\n\nPadraig Cribben, chief executive officer of Vintners’ Federation of Ireland said the reduction in the number of pubs is “worrying”. \n\n“These pubs are small businesses, mainly in rural Ireland, that provide significant employment and continue to create jobs in local communities,” he said. \n\n“In Mayo alone, hospitality and drinks businesses enable 4,095 jobs while in Donegal, there are 368 pubs and 7,445 jobs supported by the industry. \n\n“This demonstrates the scale of employment that this sector creates rurally.\n\n“However, the sharp decline in the number of pubs is worrying and is further evidence of the need to monitor the industry and ensure the necessary supports are in place to reverse this trend. \n\n“While the Government committed to assist small rural businesses recover during the recession, business owners in the drinks industry were challenged by two increases in alcohol excise tax in Budget 2012 and Budget 2013. \n\n“Our punitive alcohol excise tax – the second highest in the EU – slows the growth of these businesses and impacts their day-to-day operations and bottom line.”\n\nAround 90,000 jobs across the country are dependent on the drinks industry alone. The industry purchases over €1.1bn of Irish produce annually, exports goods worth over €1.25bn, and provides over €2.3bn worth of excise and VAT income to the state. \n\nDigi said it is calling on the Government to reduce the country’s high rate of excise tax.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"ryanair apologises after compensation cheques bounced","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

SHAME ON YOU RYANAIR. won’t respond to EMAILS and OPERATOR just put the phone down on me”.\n\nAnother passenger tweeted on August 9: “@Ryanair I would love to know why the cheque you sent me for compensation has bounced… Bank assure me this is your fault, wait 1 hour 20 on hold and your “customer services” cant help and there is no number to call to those who can? Please assure me of a call to fix this asap.”\n\nThe passenger said they were still waiting for the money 11 days later, writing to the airline: “Have contacted your call centre numerous times and just get a generic email saying my case is being delayed because I am obviously not the only person waiting for over a month for compensation…”\n\nA strike by Irish Ryanair pilots in July saw up to 30 flights cancelled, affecting some 5,000 passengers.\n\n\nRyanair explains Irish pilot strikes: \nhttps://t.co/uP64yw7a8B\n\n— Ryanair (@Ryanair) \nAugust 1, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe airline told the BBC: “Ryanair complies fully with EU261 legislation, under which no compensation is payable to customers when the (strike) delay/cancellation is beyond the airline’s control.\n\n“If these strikes, by a tiny minority of Ryanair pilots, were within Ryanair’s control, there would have been no strikes and no cancellations.”\n\nAnother strike in August by pilots in five European countries saw hundreds of flights cancelled.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass.

– as well as feature cameos from some of the sport’s biggest stars. \n\nNow at Gamescom, EA Sports has teased the final instalment of the story, which looks set to once again feature Alex’s half-sister Kim and close friend Danny Williams heavily. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe focus on the Champions League is no coincidence, the Fifa series has secured the rights to the competition for the first time this year – the tournament, along with the Europa League having both previously been a part of rival game Pro Evolution Soccer. \n\nEA Sports confirmed players will be able to switch between controlling the three main characters as they wish in order to change up their experience – while Alex and Danny are fighting for the Champions League, Kim is looking to help the US women’s team win the 2019 Women’s World Cup in France. \n\nThe likes of Neymar, Kevin De Bruyne and Paolo Dybala have been confirmed as making cameo appearances this time around too. \n\nThe full game, and the final chapter of The Journey will be available on September 25. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"a man has been snapped on a mobility scooter clutching a snake","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n
