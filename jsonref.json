A collaboration between Leeds City Art Gallery and the Henry Moore Institute next door, the Hepworth Wakefield and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, it is an up-and-down affair. There is no real sense of collaboration or unified curatorial overview, over and above the idea that “sculpture is the most anthropological of the art forms”, an axiom provided by sculptor Phyllida Barlow. Discuss.Korean Kimsooja has installed a mirrored floor (not again, you splutter) in Yorkshire Sculpture Park’s chapel, and put film on the windows to refract the light, casting rainbows round the chapel. It doesn’t do it for me. Maria Loboda has dead, exotic insects poking out from behind the specially installed alabaster light fittings in one space at the Henry Moore Institute. Huma Bhabha has installed a specially commissioned, cyborg-like figure between a statue of Queen Victoria and the war memorial in Wakefield. Carved from styrofoam then cast in bronze and painted, it grins at nothing and no one, like a recent arrival from another planet. At least it is an escape from the Damien Hirst sculptures in Leeds town centre, and towering over the sheep in Yorkshire Sculpture Park. I guess they are here to add a bit of oomph. I have nothing to say about them.A Hirst ram with golden horns occupies a room of Victorian paintings at Leeds Art Gallery, where Rachel Harrison shows an abstracted grey head that appears constructed from cardboard packaging and burlap. Trapped under one corner is the wrapper of some equally cobbled-together industrial snack bar. The visible bit of the wrapper tells us this undoubtedly flavoursome treat contains cured bacon, berries and sunflower seeds, with no added antibiotics or hormones. I guess the sculpted head grew up on a similar diet.Joanna Piotrowska has carpeted a nearby gallery and dotted it about with works from the museum’s collection. Around the walls she shows black and white photos shot in people’s homes in different countries. She asked the inhabitants to create shelters using rugs and piles of books, tables, boxes, houseplants and whatever else they had around, and then photographed the tenants in situ, cowering under the kitchen table, crawling out from their make-do tents and half-hidden behind their indoor barracades. These are fun, but the overall installation doesn’t mean very much.Upstairs in the recently restored Great Court, with its wonderful (and only lately uncovered) Victorian skylight, Ayşe Erkmen has built a skeletal full-size model of the barrel-vaulted roof in the gallery below, whose floor was a later addition to what was a full-height atrium space. Standing on the floor, you look up though Ergman’s welded, polished aluminium structure to the real roof above. The experience is strangely dislocating. I wonder for a moment if I am one of those figurines architects use to populate their model buildings.Give me instead the slightly Ghostbusters blob-thing that has sidled up to a pillar in Nobuko Tsuchiya’s group of works here. Her disarming, somehow friendly sculptures and arrangements have also mostly been made with what’s to hand. Playfulness is not to be underestimated as an art-making tactic, especially when it engages the viewer’s own imagination. You want to go home and do it yourself. Or hide under the table and never come out.At the Henry Moore Institute, Rashid Johnson has covered three big trestle tables with mounds of shea butter. Piled up like whole cheeses, sculpted into rough head-and-shoulders lumps, or left in broken and smeared pieces you are invited to play with, rub into your skin, smell or lick, Johnson’s Shea Butter Three Ways treats the waxy substance, derived from a nut grown across the African savannah, as something more than a sculptable material. You can use anything to make sculpture, but everything comes with associations. Shea butter is used as an emollient, as cooking oil, in cosmetics and traditional medicine. It is laden with cultural associations. This work is the closest we get to an anthropological nexus in the entire series of exhibitions.Upstairs in the library, Sean Lynch has resuscitated Flint Jack, a notorious 19th-century forger of flint arrow- and axe heads and other supposedly stone-age finds he discovered on his wanderings across England and Scotland, many of which he sold to collectors, antiquarians and museums. He made them all himself. An expert, self-taught artisan, he lived and worked by his wits and guile, and even conjured an old tea tray into a Roman shield. Flint Jack was the genuine article: a real fake, preying on the collector’s avarice. People half-knew they were being had, willing themselves into belief. A metaphor for the artist, then.Wolfgang Laib’s installation uses handfuls of rice to cover a large gallery floor at the Hepworth Wakefield , setting a few small stone sculptures, covered in ash, amongst little piles. I find this inordinately precious and dull, and refuse to believe, though there are many sincere suckers for this sort of thing.There is quite a bit of self-conscious noodling-about and ho-hum sculptures wherever you go. The best work at Wakefield, by miles, is by Iranian-born Nairy Baghramian. Using rough cast sheets of aluminium, and smooth resinous forms made from a hard pigmented wax used to polish metal, she choreographs the space. The stepped and rounded rhomboids, wedges and blocks have a great solidity and weight, yet seem capable of gliding about. An edge lifts from the floor. A tilted plane slumps, another form accommodates itself to an aluminium slab. Sometimes two forms are pressed together by oversize clamps. These cleavings and conjunctions feel like a slow, controlled ballet, with its holdings and releasings, leanings and supportings, convergences and separations. These movements all have a choreography of care about them, as well as drama, even as the brittle shine and sharp, friable edges of the unfinished metal sheet buffs against the softer thickness of the waxy forms. I love all this. Bahramian really knows how to use space and light as well as form. There is a sense of flow arrested, time suspended. Even her photographs of smoking chimney stacks, the vapours steaming and trailing across empty skies, adds something to the overall installation. The more you look and walk around, the more you notice details, yet somehow it is all very quiet and understated.The Yorkshire Sculpture Park has mounted a survey of American sculptor David Smith, taking us through his career from the 1930s to his untimely accidental death in 1965. Principally a welder, Smith’s development is followed through a series of galleries and out into the open air. This is an instructive, self-contained exhibition, which follows Smith from his prewar development, influenced principally by Picasso, Julio González and Giacometti’s surrealist period, and his work in car plants and wartime tank factories in the US, to his increasingly abstract postwar work. Later, Smith became a bit too frontal for me. He veered between a kind of totemic figuration and abstraction. In his later work there is all too often a front view to be looked at, rather than a sculpture to be walked around. The work’s installation reinforces this view. His best work was a kind of steel and iron bricolage, here you feel him working things in the round. The rest is just all heft.A trip to the four galleries and two cities over the next 100 days is unlikely to prove or disprove anything much at all, other than that there doesn’t seem to be any shared idea here about what sculpture now might be, never mind about the anthropology. The Yorkshire Sculpture International is going to have to up its game to make further editions worthwhile."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64eb68065c81717b8c575ab00cf1476cada6d2b3/0_0_2000_1321/master/2000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=88155a20c7f353fe00de009be565e481","title":"darwin earthquake city centre evacuated after 72 magnitude tremor","story":"Bureau of Meteorology says no tsunami threat from quake, which occurred at a depth of 200km in the Banda Sea, north of AustraliaDarwin residents have reported buildings swaying and parts of the city centre have been evacuated after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit the city.The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Banda Sea, north of Timor-Leste, on Monday and prompted reports of large tremors in the Top End city.The Bureau of Meteorology issued an alert just after 1pm saying there was no tsunami threat to Australia following the earthquake.Residents in Darwin reported large tremors and feeling tables shake but there were no immediate reports of major damage or injury.Jonathan Bathgate, a seismologist at Geoscience Australia, said the 7.2 magnitude earthquake had occurred just before midday approximately 700km (435 miles) north of Darwin.

He told the ABC he had been preparing lunch at a kitchen bench “when I heard this roar”.“I thought it was a jet aircraft down very low, and my wife started running for the front door,” he said. “All the drawers started opening in the kitchen, and I said to her, ‘What’s going on?’“And she said, ‘It’s an earthquake, come on, let’s get out of here.’“So I left everything there and we ran down the fire escape, but while we were in that stairwell, the stairwell was rocking that hard, just side to side.“I lost my balance, a couple of times. It’s the worst one I’ve ever experienced in the four years we’ve been here, that’s for sure.”Bathgate said earthquakes of that magnitude were not uncommon in the Banda Sea.“We get magnitude sevens not often but on a regular sort of basis,” he said. “The last magnitude seven in this area was in 2012 at 7.1, and prior to that there was a 7.1 in 2005. They happen sort of once every 10 years or even more frequently than that.”The quake came just hours after a 6.1-magnitude earthquake hit Papua, also in the eastern part of the south-east Asian archipelago.That quake hit about 240km west of the town of Abepura in Papua province, at a relatively shallow depth of 21km, according to the United States Geological Survey.There were also no immediate reports of casualties.A shallower 6.3-magnitude hit the area last week, but the damage was not extensive.Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity owing to its position on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, where tectonic plates collide.A University of Melbourne earthquake scientist, Assoc Prof Mark Quigley, told  Australia that seismic activity in the region tended to “ebb and flow”.“The seismic activity waxes and wanes all the time – it’s one of the more seismic active parts of the planet,” he said.“So we get ebbs and flows and sometimes they talk to each other, they communicate stresses along the plate boundary and set others off. There’s nothing particularly sinister about major earthquakes there because they’re literally happening all the time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ba6dfe1cafb12ee30c277a44437df957942ad54/0_209_2431_1458/master/2431.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=967b9cf57775f7a014d49d50ccf7b7ec","title":"cost cheap fast fashion workers planet","story":"Online retailers such as Boohoo and Missguided are booming, but critics say there is a hidden priceIt comes in red, mustard and black, in sizes 6 up to 16 the bandeau bodycon minidress, is, according to the online retailer Boohoo, “perfect for transitioning from day to play”.It is not so much the styling and colour, but the price of the £5 dress – reduced this week to just £4 – which attracts thousands of the thriving retailer’s 5 million UK customers to add it to their online shopping bag, click and pay.Products and prices like these have driven Boohoo’s profits to a record £59.9m, bucking the trend of struggling high street fashion stores across the country.Made in the UK, at factories in Leicester and Manchester, the £5 dress epitomises a fast fashion industry that pumps hundreds of new collections on to the market in short time at pocket money prices, with social media celebrity endorsement to boost high consumer demand. On average, such dresses and other products are discarded by consumers after five weeks.Missguided, an online rival to Boohoo, which also sources products from Leicester, took the low pricing even further this week by promoting a £1 bikini, which proved so popular with customers that the website crashed.But behind the price tag there is an environmental and social cost not contained on the label of such products. “The hidden price tag is the cost people in the supply chain and the environment itself pays,” said Sass Brown, a lecturer at the Manchester Fashion Institute. “The price is just too good to be true.”\u0027Fast fashion\u0027 is a phrase coined to describe inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends. Critics say that the industry has a large carbon footprint,\u0026nbspand creates water and air pollution. Clothes are often manufactured in poor working conditions.Garments are manufactured cheaply, and are expected to have a short life. One in three young women, the biggest segment of consumers,\u0026nbspconsider garments worn once or twice to be\u0026nbspold. UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfill in 2018.Without rapid reform, the fashion industry - of which fast fashion is the dominant player – could be responsible for\u0026nbspa quarter of the Earth’s carbon budget by 2050.Socially, the booming fast fashion industry is often built on low wages paid to women working in factories abroad but also increasingly in the UK, in cities such as Manchester, Birmingham, London and Leicester. There is no evidence that factories in the Boohoo and Missguided supply chains pay illegal wages. However, some garment workers in Leicester are paid an average of £3 an hour – way under the national minimum wage – MPs heard in evidence.MPs found that the Modern Slavery Act was not robust enough to stop wage exploitation at UK clothing factories. There was a lack of inspection or enforcement, allowing factories – none of which are unionised – to get away with paying illegal wages.In the UK, we buy more clothes per person than any other country in Europe – five times what we bought in the 1980s, which creates 1.3m tonnes of waste each year, some 350,000 tonnes of which is dumped in landfill or incinerated.Yet despite the overwhelming evidence gathered by the environmental audit committee (EAC), ministers this week rejected every recommendation for tackling abuses across the fashion industry, including a ban on incinerating or landfilling stock that can be recycled and a 1p charge on each garment to raise £35m a year for better clothing collection and sorting, a move supported by many in the industry.Theresa May said in parliament the government already had measures in place, including a multimillion-pound grant scheme to help boost the recycling of textiles and plastic packaging.But the response of the government was met with anger by many within the industry, where ethical fashion firms come up against others who produce at lower costs on the back of exploitative wage structures and environmentally damaging production models.Phoebe English, the English fashion designer, said: “It is extremely alarming to see that our government has failed to grasp the true extent of the consequences of the fashion industry carrying on the way it is.“It is a vastly damaging industry that has been spiralling unchecked for far too long. The Earth and the people on it are exploited and damaged at every single step of the chain, and this culminates with unimaginable mountains of unused excess stock or badly made broken waste clothing with nowhere to go other than landfill or incineration.”English said it was up to the industry to pull together to regulate itself and urgently put an end to bad practice.But others are less sure that voluntary measures will tackle what they say is a systemic power imbalance between brands and manufacturers, which leads to worker exploitation, or address the enormous environmental footprint of their trade.“The knowledge is out there. We know the scale of those impacts and we know what some of the solutions are,” said Dr Mark Sumner, a lecturer in retail and fashion at the University of Leeds. “What we need is the government to come up with some clear policy, whether it’s around legislation, or voluntary initiatives to incentivise a change of behaviour by brands.”With growing scrutiny of their business model, brands are beginning to promote an ethical face. This week Boohoo promoted its recycled brand For the Future, using fabrics made from synthetic waste saved from landfill.“They are moving in the right direction, but this is a micro-percentage of their output,” said Brown. While Boohoo is promoting its “green” credentials, repeated attempts by the trade union Usdaw to talk to workers at its delivery centre in the UK about union rights are being rebuffed by the company. Mary Creagh, the chair of the EAC, said: “If brands want to be ethical, they should start by allowing a trade union into their premises rather than barring the door.”Prof Nikolaus Hammer, associate professor in work and employment at Leicester University, carried out research into the fashion industry in Leicester, where he found employees working in appalling conditions, with no employment contracts, earning on average £3 an hour. It was the brands, he said, who held all the power over manufacturers to keep cutting their prices. “They will go to the manufacturer and say that person down the road can do it for 1p less, and they get the job,” he said.He doubted that any greening measures by brands could make them ethical and sustainable while still fulfilling the model of fast fashion.“The fundamental problem with much of fast fashion is that its social and environmental costs are not taken into account. The environmental costs of materials and fabric are mostly offshored. The production that takes place in the UK often only pays half the legal minimum wage.“So who is accountable for water and chemical pollution abroad, precarious work and employment, the undercutting of compliant manufacturers, the pollution from delivery and lack of recycling at home? Brands might find it difficult to make £5 fast fashion dresses and be socially and environmentally sustainable.”Carol Kane, the co-founder of Boohoo, told MPs the £5 dress was a “loss leader” drawing people to the website. She said the company employed three people in Manchester, three in Leicester, and 10 in China to carry out audits at their producer factories each month to ensure proper working practices.

There have been new lambs to check on, goats, cats and dogs to feed, beehives to inspect, orders to fill, and she has also made a visit to her under-construction workshop.Her current life making and selling cheese, honey and tahini in Turkey’s beautiful Çanakkale region could not be more different to her old one in Istanbul. The work can be exhausting but, Ava says, she would not give it up for anything.“The business throws up unexpected challenges all the time,” she says. “But there is a level of peace here I could never find in Istanbul. I feel so much more free.”Ava was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey’s teeming intellectual metropolis, where she used to run a fabrics business and briefly worked at Istanbul University’s economics department. She became politically active during the city’s Gezi park protests, which sparked a wave of civil unrest across the country in 2013. Like thousands of others, eventually she was arrested and lost her job.Many of Istanbul’s 15 million inhabitants would never dream of moving out of the city to more conservative parts of Turkey. But Ava, who was sick of the increasingly suffocating political climate, made the decision to leave for the Anatolian countryside in 2014.It turns out she was at the forefront of a demographic shift in the country: for the first time, more people are moving out of Turkey’s largest cities than are moving into them, according to Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) data. A total of 595,000 people left Istanbul in 2017-2018.The TurkStat report cites in particular a drop-off in the tourism and construction industries for the reverse migration from Turkey’s biggest city back to smaller cities and towns across the country’s east.As well as workers from elsewhere in Turkey who have returned home, some of those leaving Istanbul appear to be its homegrown liberal and cultural elites. Some have gone abroad but scores of Istanbullus are also making the move to the Turkish countryside to start their own farms, vineyards and boutique hotels. Many more work remote or freelance jobs from their laptops from Çanakkale province, on the Aegean Sea, or the adjacent Kas mountains, which have become the new hub for people in the Turkish cinema industry. While younger Çanakkale generations have left for better paid work in Çanakkale city and the town of Edremit in nearby Balikesir, the livelihoods of at least half the population of the province’s villages still depend on rearing animals and agriculture.Shellie Corman, originally from the US, moved to Istanbul in 2005. She ran a cafe in Cihangir, the city’s premier hipster neighbourhood, before she and her husband, Mehmet, a former dancer with the Turkish state ballet, moved to the Canakkale village of Ilyasfaki in 2016.“Istanbul is a very exciting city and I loved living there, but after Gezi people became scared and unhappy,” she says. “There were terrorist attacks. The traffic and how crowded it was began to bother me. The city changed, and we changed too.”“Ilyasfaki exists in rhythm with the seasons, and I love growing our own vegetables and making our own yoghurt. We have just about enough money, but overall we are much happier.”Life in Çanakkale is not perfect. Residents complain that replanted Istanbullus make no effort to fit into the local community, preferring each other’s company. The new arrivals, for their part, say they are often greeted with hostility. Some give up on their pastoral dreams after a few years, finding the work too gruelling. There are also worries that gentrification will push up prices and lead to overdevelopment.“Over the last few years a lot of Istanbul people have moved here and they keep on coming,” says Metin Gürel from Edremit. “They come here for the simple lifestyle and then complain about donkeys and sheep in the village streets. If you think the animals stink, stay in the city.”As Turkey lurches through various economic and political crises, however, the urban-to-rural migration trend looks likely to continue.“At the end of the day, it’s a balance, and too many new people too quickly is going to cause some problems,” says Mehmet Laleli, a local who started a successful organic olive and olive oil company in Balikesir’s Burhaniye 13 years ago.“The shift is creating jobs and making the area even more of a tourist destination. And ultimately that means more money coming into these communities.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5c4ffda073aa7fab1501eb5d7d503a8be0bc20b/0_266_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ade8333b39aec8cbd886a37d5aa71b6a","title":"humans v the city the staggering scale of chongqing in pictures","story":"Chongqing’s population is estimated at just below 10 million but that rises to more than 31 million if the built-up surroundings are included.

By the morning of 24 June, 11 others scheduled to speak had also withdrawn (Lola Olufemi, Waithera Sebatindira, Malia Bouattia, Sahar Al-Faifi, Dilly Hussain, Hussein Kesvani, Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff, Paula Akpan, Lauren Booth and Madiha Raza). We did not do so because we oppose the festival itself. I have previously performed poetry there and believe the BLF has done invaluable work for the local community through years of grassroots engagement centred on BME people. However, I chose not to participate this year when I found out the festival was a beneficiary of a fund called Building a Stronger Britain Together (BSBT). This fund comes from the government’s Counter-Extremism Strategy (CES) and it is this strategy, this fund, and this connection that I and others oppose.The government’s website describes BSBT as “funding and support for groups involved in counter-extremism projects in their communities”, and it was used to fund some of BLF’s pre-festival programmes engaging local Muslim women on their aspirations and literacy. While I am sure the programmes were beneficial to participants, it is highly problematic to suggest that the people the projects engage are at risk of becoming extremists due solely to their identity. It is rooted in the counter-radicalisation thesis that suggests that since any Muslim could become violent, all Muslims require monitoring. It reduces Muslims to subjects requiring de-radicalisation.Bradford’s predominantly Pakistani, Muslim population has long been looked at through a lens of criminality. Not only does BSBT look at the community through that same lens but it also entails a level of information collection, because it requires reporting on outcomes. There is no guarantee how that information is used or stored.BSBT requires recipients to show “demonstrable outcomes which provide a positive alternative to extremist voices”, thus framing the festival as less of a community-centred space of art and discussion and more as a deliberate, targeted strategy – one that insinuates that Muslim women’s educational and literacy levels correlate to extremism. Counter-extremism should work largely to displace the material conditions that disenfranchise people, which may lead them to express grievances violently – including austerity, poverty, structural racism, Islamophobia and more. A government could seek to change these rather than funnelling money into an apparatus that approaches Muslims as a suspect community living in a vacuum.This is particularly pernicious in the austerity context, where government has pulled money from arts and culture and cut local council budgets so that spaces such as libraries and community centres are on the decline. It means counter-extremism becomes one of very few pots of funding that groups such as BLF feel they can draw on to create those missing spaces. This makes organisations dependent on counter-extremism funding. We refuse to give credibility to the idea there is demand for such funds. Some have argued that we should express this opinion at the festival, but this counter-extremism strategy would only gain more credibility if it could be said dissenting voices were given space to speak under its banner. I refuse to normalise it as an acceptable way to work with marginalised Muslim communities.With others who have withdrawn, I want to expose the pernicious way counter-extremism works. We don’t want BLF to stop running, we want it to continue, but in such a way that the local community’s trust is not breached, art is not securitised, our concerns are properly met and acknowledged, and the government’s agenda is resisted so that funds relating to arts and culture, not policing and counter-extremism, are what prop up an important festival like this.• Suhaiymah Manzoor-Khan is an author, spoken-word poet and educatorWhen I was young, I believed the good fight was fought bare-knuckled. With time I’ve learned to pick my battles, and to see beyond the black and white.I will be at the Bradford literature festival next weekend because I believe in it and what it hopes to accomplish. I grew up in Bradford and I know the founder, Syima Aslam, well. As a cub reporter at the local paper, I spent many an evening at her restaurant in the heart of the city. We knew the city’s faults, we also knew its great strengths, and what it could be given the chance. I left. But Aslam stayed, and has built something amazing. Brick by brick, she has laid a foundation under the castles she once built in the air. It is important work.Bradford’s children need role models. They need authority figures who look like them, and they need to see artists, writers, creatives, from similar faiths and skin tones, discussing issues that they and their parents face.This is a city with segregated schools and high unemployment, with countless kids who aspire to a life of crime. This is a city that has to fight to be seen, for outside interest and investment. Festivals get funded every day. But organising this kind of event in Bradford is an extraordinary feat.I have been the only Muslim journalist in a newsroom. I have faced Islamaphobia and racism. I understand the concerns raised. But I also understand poverty, lack of opportunity, racism, being misunderstood by one’s own, and by the outside world, all of which the good people of Bradford face daily. I understand this because I worked in the heart of these people. I understand this because these are my people. I also know the need to stand by one’s principles. But having principles is a privilege not everyone can afford. Boycotting the Bradford literature festival is akin to withholding bread as we wait for cake. It takes great clout for a boycott to bring change. Clout that we do not yet possess. Clout that the rich mix of this particular festival, a festival that welcomes debate and is led by British Muslim women of south Asian heritage, wants to help us build.If you really want to bring change, and empower people, then do the event. Take to the stage. Speak your truth to an audience who wants to hear you. And give your fee to charity. Making a public declaration of withdrawal helps no one but one’s ego.• Saima Mir is a freelance journalist and writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b7ebf35202261a74e13eb6551a452cfcac99c69/0_356_4185_2511/master/4185.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=695cb56688aa72b69cd30702d46e61a4","title":"comedy write women itv ban male writers","story":"Last Monday, I spoke for five minutes on a panel in Bradford, alongside the head of ITV comedy, about ersity in television. As a working comedy writer, I was well positioned to make the point that comedy is better when it’s written by a wide range of voices – people of different genders, races, sexualities, everything. Mad controversial, right? Burn the witch! I assumed my comments would, like most comments ever made on panel discussions, be lost in the annals of time. Even if I wasn’t, like most people on panels, speaking out of my annals.Quite the shock, then, when I woke up the next morning to find that my name, photo, quotes and tweets had been used – without my knowledge – on multiple news platforms. Most under versions of the inaccurate headline “ITV bans all-male comedy teams”. I opened story after story to see an (old) photo of myself, looking like a demented elf who just tried ketamine for the first time, staring up at the world as the new poster child for “keeping men out of comedy” … GO AWAY MEN! TAKE YOUR PENISES, TUCK THEM BETWEEN YOUR LEGS AND NEVER BE FUNNY AGAIN! The stories mentioned I had recently been hired to write on ITV’s CelebAbility, a show that had no female writers on its previous two series.I can’t speak for ITV but as far as I understand it, nothing has been “banned”. ITV’s comedy commissioner, the excellent Saskia Schuster, has launched an initiative, Comedy 50:50, to move away from all-male writers’ rooms – and has changed ITV contracts so shows must aim towards equal gender representation. If you don’t know what a writers’ room is, (congratulations, you’ve made better life choices than me), it’s a group of writers, usually put together by producers in order to write jokes for a sketch or entertainment show or create stories for a sitcom. Historically they have been male-dominated, and I admire Saskia’s attempts to draw in more much-needed female voices. (And I’m not just saying that so she’ll commission the sitcom I pitch her next month – working title: GalQaeda.)The reaction online revealed an uncomfortable truth: some people are terrified of inclusion. On the one hand, I get it. If TV comedy was an antelope you were eating and some female writers came along and started eating the antelope too … there’d be less antelope for you. I’d understand that you might be chagrined. But – and I know this sounds crazy – TV writing is NOT an antelope. More varied voices create better comedy. And better comedy creates an appetite for MORE comedy. It serves everyone in television when shows go well. Great shows beget great shows, we’ve all seen it happen. After you loved Fleabag, didn’t you crave more shows like it? Success feeds the industry. Even if Fleabag’s sexy priest left us all on our knees, horny and confused.When certain people hear that there’s to be an end of “all-male writers’ rooms”, they don’t hear “this will be better for everyone”. They hear “something is being taken away from you”. As the saying goes: when you’re accustomed to privilege, sometimes equality feels like oppression.The big (misguided) belief is that the men already in the writers’ room “deserve to be there” and the new women don’t. That’s a myth. Everyone who has ever worked in TV got there because someone opened a door for them. If they can’t do the job they won’t last long. This is just about giving more people a chance in a system that has not, until now, been designed to do so. Is that really such a big ask? (Don’t worry, I’m sure they’ll still get paid less.) I understand that headlines are designed to grab our attention and make us click, but it’s annoying when a good news story is framed as a bad one. If I, a lowly comedy writer, could make a gentle suggestion: not everything has to be a culture war. Not every conversation has to have two polar views with no room for nuance. Life is nuance. (OK, that “life is nuance” sentence is a bit on the nose, but don’t worry: I’ll get a room of men to rewrite it later).For the sake of the future of comedy, hire more varied writers. And I don’t just mean female writers: hire more writers of colour, more queer, disabled, trans, working-class writers, maybe even some vegan writers … And look, I can only take on the world one article at a time, but how about we open this attitude of inclusion to all industries? To all people? Remember, if they’re not good enough, they’ll quickly fall away. But if they are good enough, it will make the work better and stronger. For all of us.Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to get back to writing my GalQaeda pitch – which Andrew Lloyd Webber has already agreed to score.• Brona C Titley is a TV comedy writer and actor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64bc639186e0678181994afd9c2854709725d5a5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=861fc84ed2e988c10894fc479017d146","title":"facebook google currency libra financial transactions","story":"Dystopian fiction – from Anthony Burgess’s A Clockwork Orange to Russell T Davies’s spectacular recent BBC1 series Years and Years – is usually intended to take elements of the present and then imagine a future in which they have become inescapable, so as to warn us of what might already be in our midst.But the 21st century is challenging this technique in one bracing sense: the way the world now seems to race beyond the wildest aspects of our collective imagination before we have even started to think about what might come next. Consider last week’s news about Facebook, and the fact that three years of corporate disgrace – and rising noise from legislators about bringing the tech giant to heel – have yet to slow its terrifying quest to insinuate its workings into every area of our lives. Now, in a move that could have been taken from a futuristic novel, it wants to create nothing less than a new global currency.Naturally enough, the idea is presented not in terms of profit maximisation, but the philanthropic feelgoodery that seems to make northern Californians billionaires as a matter of accident. One element of the initiative is making person-to-person transactions possible at either low or no cost – so that the migrant worker, say, can wire money home to their family and be assured that no one will be taking a cut. Moreover, thanks to the ease of wage and bill payments, people so far left out of financial services can cease to be “unbanked”, and thereby gain more personal freedom. This is hardly a new idea, but, as with most Facebook initiatives, it’s superficially a very good one.But, capitalism being capitalism, there are likely to be more venal motivations at work. There are vast markets in the developing world where Facebook and its subsidiaries have millions of users but are held back from creaming off advertising revenue by the simple matter of poverty. Libra offers new revenue opportunities, partly by inviting people to exchange national currencies for the new medium, thereby gifting Facebook and its partners a vast pool of funds. In these territories, and more affluent places, the new currency also offers Facebook the chance to accelerate what sits at the heart of everything it does: the harvesting of endless data, which can then be monetised.Facebook is at pains to address such anxieties, but its initial outline of how the new currency will be used in Messenger and WhatsApp via Calibra is not exactly reassuring. At the very least, Facebook will know the people and companies with whom its users have financially interacted, but that is likely to only be the start. “Calibra will not share account information or financial data with Facebook, Inc or any third party without customer consent,” it says (my italics). Obviously, the company has past form here: the kind of forced consent that means you either allow Facebook to gobble up your data or don’t get access to many of its services. Whatever the guarantees, the most basic point is obvious enough: why should a company with such an appalling record on personal data be trusted to so massively extend its reach?Other questions abound. What will happen if Libra sucks national currencies out of already vulnerable economies? What will be its relationship to inflation? What of the dangers of international money laundering? Why are Facebook high-ups already talking about Libra extending into credit?Facebook says Libra is a \u0027global currency and financial infrastructure\u0027 - a digital asset built by Facebook and powered by a new Facebook-created version of blockchain, the encrypted technology used by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The name Libra comes from the basic Roman measurement of weight. The abbreviation lb for pound is derived from Libra, and the £ symbol originally comes from an ornate L in Libra.Facebook claims it wants to reach the 1.7 billion people around the world who do not have access to a bank account.Facebook is likely to run into regulatory hurdles and antitrust concerns. The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the \u0027Libra Association\u0027. It functions as what is known as a \u0027stablecoin\u0027, pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience.The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland. Within the Libra Association will be a governing body called the Libra Association Council, comprised of a representative of each member of the association, which will vote on policy and operating decisions.Facebook claims that although it created the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, once the currency is launched in 2020 the company will withdraw from a leadership role and all members of the association will have equal votes in governance of Libra. The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(£8m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhen the cryptocurrency launches, users can download Calibra, a digital wallet, that will allow them to send it to anyone with a smartphone. It will be available in Messenger, WhatsApp, and as a standalone app.It is not clear which countries the coin will launch in first, though Facebook said \u0027almost anybody\u0027 in the world with a smartphone will be able to download the app.Such concerns were highlighted last week by indications that India’s institutional hostility to cryptocurrencies means Libra will not be launched there, for the time being at least. But every bit as alarming is how the entry of Facebook into the creation of money will lead it to another sphere currently overseen by the state: beyond everyday consumerism, into the nitty-gritty of how we use public services and interact with government – in education, health, social care, crime and punishment, and everything else.Google has already got there, as proved by everything from its vast presence in the US education system to the use of NHS data by its artificial intelligence wing, DeepMind. But think about everyday payments: come 2050, across the planet, what currencies do we think will be used for taxes, benefits, fines, bail, student loan repayments and all the rest – and what will happen to the huge data trails such things create? In China, those on the all-encompassing social network WeChat – which Zuckerberg clearly wants to emulate – can use it to pay taxes and fines. Even in fusty old Britain, the Cabinet Office has already considered using Facebook logins as a means for people to access social security benefits, make council tax payments and get a driver’s licence. Why would it not then think about what we may yet know as Librafication?At that point, surveillance capitalism would colonise the shrinking parts of our lives it has so far left relatively untouched. It would amass mountains of lucrative information about everything from our friends to when we last paid a speeding fine – and in the process, bring unlimited corporate power into areas we still consider subject to the checks and balances of democracy. The state could also have a field day: can you imagine the glee at the Department for Work and Pensions if it was able to monitor not just people’s universal credit payments but how they spent them?But the biggest question of all is screamingly obvious, and worth asking for the thousandth time: how, in any meaningful way, can we hold Facebook – and Google – to account, and drastically limit their power? The answer surely starts with a massive international no to big tech’s most hubristic scheme yet. Otherwise the creators of fictional dystopias may as well give up: however surreal and messed up their imaginings, the world will have gone beyond them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36968431c9b152e540a42484467f00b34a025738/0_117_3520_2113/master/3520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0add80572de588a39cbf288abafa19c2","title":"found wallet prove us researchers lost honesty","story":"Which is all well and good, but how honest are you?

So let’s be creativeYou know those conversations that keep coming round, such as what you would do if the apocalypse happened (dig down), or where you would go if you had a time machine (either Cleopatra’s Egypt or a Cloud Atlas future to meet face-tat Hugh Grant)? One that occurs more and more within my friendship groups is about communal living in retirement: everyone chipping in to buy a house together, where we can play endless games of Mario Kart, sing D’Angelo round the Bösendorfer and indulge in vast quantities of mind-bending prescription drugs. I feel fairly confident that I’m a few decades away from having to think about it seriously, but I reckon waltzing through the twilight years in a shared house with all your mates could be a great way to loll about before the music stops and the needle lifts.I have just had a little taste of what it might be like. My friends Elen and James very sensibly got married in Cepha-bloomin’-lonia, and a whole big gang of us (maybe 16 in total, including bride and groom) were all bundled into one big villa for the week. It was nothing short of utopian: to while away the days in gooey sunlight, never wholly sober, comparing mosquito bites and discussing everything other than Tr**p and Br***t, among a clique so unquenchably fun, so unquestioningly generous and so totally incapable of monitoring their alcohol consumption. The whole flock was glitter-glam and gorgeous. And those unspoken communal understandings around isions of labour, they were happily respected by all. We had got each other’s backs, left no man behind and took it in turns to go to the bakery in the morning. As the week went on, it all began to feel quite possible: a new postmodern mode for family, anarcho-lushness, a gestalt alliance in sequins and cheap wine. It’s the dream, isn’t it – for retirement to be one long holiday?The current thinking on millennials’ retirement prospects casts a very dark cloud over any optimism my generation can have for old age. A 2018 report from the pensions investment company Royal London said that the average person will have to set aside £260,000 in their working life to have a comfortable retirement. While I’m fortunate enough to be fairly secure in my finances (by the fateful spin of a metaphysical fruit machine in my childhood), the majority of my friends simply can’t afford to save. At least half of them are creative professionals who, a generation back, would have been financially secure homeowners, but now, with student debt and the likelihood of a life paying rent, blowing a few hundred quid on a Greek holiday makes far more sense than dwelling on eventual existential hazards.I’m going to make a case for hope. Despite the intergenerational slander that Generations Y and Z regularly receive from our elders (in particular, it seems, from late-middle-age “liberal” white guys such as Bret Easton Ellis, Louis CK and Bill Maher), my impression of young adults today is that we have a far greater instinct for collectivism than any of the postwar generations. Growing up in a world with Wikipedia, Napster and streaming subscriptions has meant that concepts of ownership (physical and intellectual) are less important to us than they were to others before us. A preference for meaningful or hedonistic group experiences over the acquisition of stuff (driven in part by the fact that all the tech you need fits into your pocket and costs £30 a month) suggests to me that younger adults are already halfway there when it comes to a culture of cooperation, and we’re aware that the future will demand it of us.Far from being the epitome of narcissism, inidualism and entitlement (as, by the way, every generation in modern history has at some point been described), millennials will, I think, prove to be unique in the contemporary era. By dint of our sorry inheritance of economic, ecological and cultural shit-shows, most of us won’t be indulged with profligate earnings and courted by the “virtues” of consumerism. The entropy of societies has to start reversing because ultimately we need each other more than we need status symbols.The millennial generation may be destined to be one of the poorest, in monetary terms, but if we’re careful, generous and tactile with one another we could be one of the wealthiest in terms of wellbeing. If we have each other’s backs, if we leave no man behind, and take it in turns to go to the bakery in the morning, I see no reason why we can’t look forward to a glorious collective retirement. I’m thinking somewhere coastal, somewhere I can strip off my make-do-and-mend clothing and pelt as fast as my old-lady legs will allow me, tits akimbo, into the ocean. And, bobbing there on my back I will gaze up at the sky, “the deep blue air, that shows nothing, and is nowhere, and is endless”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44f34539aab1c06dc6129e3191ccb525bfb6e94c/0_3_3664_2199/master/3664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18d1ef9d5e8b6ed8b121e51a15a90fa0","title":"northern powerhouse investment george osborne","story":"George Osborne’s grandiose talk counts for nothing if regional investment is stifled by the political ideology behind austerity• Chi Onwurah is Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne CentralA hundred yards from Newcastle station, restored but not particularly well signposted, stands the shed where George Stephenson built the world’s first commercial train engine, Locomotion No 1, in 1825. From the trains that revolutionised transport to the steel that mechanised production to the coal that fed the fires, the north literally powered the first industrial revolution and the wealth it generated. Two centuries on, and the “northern powerhouse” has just turned five. Not the north as a powerhouse but George Osborne’s 2014 “ambition” for the north.In its birthday assessment, IPPR North concludes that the northern powerhouse has been held back by austerity. As a northern MP and shadow minister for industrial strategy, my assessment would be more critical – austerity was the pre-eminent political ideology of the Cameron-Osborne-Clegg government, regional renaissance was not, and the northern powerhouse proves that.I am a member of the all-party parliamentary group for the northern powerhouse, I have attended its events and will continue to contribute constructively in any way I can. I value its ambition, its voice, its research. But without real investment, powers and accountability, it can never be more than a marketing ploy with a little money attached.That change is needed is not in doubt. The forced deindustrialisation of the north and the financialisation of the economy under Margaret Thatcher shifted capitalism’s focus from things to derivatives of things, and sucked resources, talent, skills and prosperity into the south. The 2010-15 ConservativeLiberal Democrat coalition prioritised cutting public spending in the short term over all other objectives, including regional equality and long-term social cohesion. One of their first acts was to abolish the regional development agencies – economic regional liberalism meant every region fending for itself.After a few years they realised that even as a fiction, one nation ToryismLiberalism required some policies, and so we got the northern powerhouse. For a while no one could say what it was – a speech, an initiative, an agenda, a brand? Eventually it became a partnership and a ministerial title. The question now is what it has it done for the north.The IPPR report cites as major northern powerhouse achievements that half the people living in the north are now governed by mayors and that Transport for the North has a £70bn investment blueprint. But to my constituent looking to retrain while juggling two low-paying jobs and no childcare, it is not the structure of local government that matters but its effectiveness in changing her life. The transport blueprint is great, but IPPR’s figures show that transport spending has risen by more than twice as much per person in London as in the north and late trains on northern franchises have more than doubled over the lifetime of the northern powerhouse. Moreover, 200,000 more northern children are living in a poor households, and the number of jobs paying less than the living wage rose by 150,000. This against an austerity backdrop that saw £3.6bn removed from the north in public spending cuts, though the south east and the south west between them saw a £4.7bn rise.When it comes to research and development, so essential for driving a high-skill, high-wage, high-productivity economy, it is the Golden Triangle of London, Cambridge and Oxford that attracts over half of all research funding – more than £17bn. A mere £0.6bn goes to the north east. Cambridge, with a population of 285,000, has as many private R\u0026ampD jobs as the whole of the north, with a population of 15 million.It is a characteristic of neoliberal politics to respond to large problems with small solutions. The northern powerhouse is an example of this. The north has the potential to drive a true, green, reindustrialisation that will help create good jobs, save the planet and rebalance our economy to deliver a more united country. But this is not a trivial challenge to be solved with a nice name and a few conferences. This is a structural change to the economy that requires real investment to deliver real return.George Stephenson focused his energy on bringing together the funding to build Locomotion No 1, the engine, not the brand. George Osborne should have done the same for the northern powerhouse. As he turns his attention to supporting fellow former Bullingdon Club member Boris Johnson for leader of the Conservative party he should remember that real success is measured not in grandiose pronouncements but real lives changed.• Chi Onwurah is the Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f857caab081a06e58ebf6bb3cf8028626b4d0934/0_36_2150_1291/master/2150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c259d76acbdcd679aba87e5e82252a29","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of needle","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘needle’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘needle’.Share your photos of what needle means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 26 June at 10am.

But, 15 years later, he’s part of a movement intent on taking it to EuropePlaying tape-ball in Lahore, joining a game in a Leyton car park, coaching at Lord’s – it’s not a bad trajectory.Adnan Choudhry, one of the UK’s strongest proponents of a relatively unknown version of cricket called tape-ball, refers to his sporting journey as a “remarkable thing”.Although relatively few fans in England are aware of tape-ball, the sport – a version of street cricket developed in Pakistan – is growing considerably, both in its country of origin and farther afield.The name comes from the use of electrical tape to cover a tennis ball this ensures players have the opportunity to experience all aspects of hard-ball cricket – just with less outlay and less risk.Costly pads, helmets and gloves are not required, as the ball poses less of a threat than the traditional, leather-bound wooden ball. “Cricket is an expensive sport to play, but tape-ball makes it much easier,” says Choudhry. “You just need a bat, ball and tape.“You can play in a car park, a normal park, any place where you can run around a little. You don’t need gear or even 11 players – just a few friends. But you use the same type of skills that are used in hard ball cricket.”As a young child growing up in Pakistan, Choudhry was first introduced to tape-ball by his uncle, who played for his work team. Fascinated by what he was watching, the 10-year-old began playing with his uncle on the dusty neighbourhood streets.At the time, it was a sport played mainly for fun, but over the past decade it has grown in popularity, and sponsorship has made tape-ball cricket a fully professional sport in Pakistan.“I played mostly with my friends when I was younger,” Choudhry says. “It was popular then, but now it’s grown all over south Asia and is expanding beyond the continent.“Players who are good enough are now able to play it professionally and choose it as a career. There are lots of tournaments and events, the players get paid, and there are coaches specifically for tape-ball.”When Choudhry arrived in England in 2004, at the age of 19, to study business at college, it was the first time he had ventured away from his family and his country.He knew there would be plenty of competitive hard-ball cricket played in his adopted home, but imagined tape-ball hadn’t been exported to the UK.But a friend from Lahore knew where there was a tape-ball game being played in a car park in Leyton, London – and it was this that helped Choudhry find his feet. “Playing cricket – tape-ball in particular – is how I made friends and connections. It opened up new doors for me,” he says.That first game in the car park quickly became a regular event, with spectators becoming players. “We created a team, and through tape-ball we were able to connect with some local clubs,” he says.Ace Avengers Lions – the club Choudhry helped form in 2016 that also plays T20 and T10 cricket – has grown in the past four years from just two friends to more than 100 members.Its creation was partly driven by the knowledge that children in his local Walthamstow area were unaware of pathways to playing cricket, or being able to easily find a club to join.Choudhry also works as a cricket coach and engagement officer for Capital Kids Cricket, an organisation that delivers cricket-related projects in London, as well as coaching on the Chance to Shine Street programme. Both organisations focus on providing disadvantaged people with the opportunity to participate in healthy, physical, activity.Once Waltham Forest council became aware of the work Choudhry was doing, it was keen to get behind the initiative and provide added resources and support.“This area is quite deprived, and a few years ago the kids here did not have easy access to sports. We are trying to bring tape-ball to a school level and introduce it to kids at a young age,” says Choudhry.It’s an aim shared by NatWest, who have spent almost 40 years championing cricket as a sport for all by partnering with organisations such as Chance to Shine. The national children’s charity engages young people in communities across the country, and uses cricket to create positive opportunities and show the sport is available to everyone.This year, Choudhry helped host a tape-ball event for the local community that was sponsored by Essex Cricket and Leyton Orient FC – with the football club hosting at their ground.Local primary and secondary school pupils participated, and 50 visually impaired students from nearby Joseph Clarke school also played an adapted version of the game.Later in the day came the main event, The Tornado Tape Ball World Cup – an eight-team tournament in which Choudhry’s Ace Avengers were victorious.It was a day filled with pride for Choudhry, who now has ambitions beyond the UK for tape-ball. “In the future, there are tape-ball teams from Germany, France and Belgium that we are hoping to bring over here to play, or we can travel to play them.”Playing and coaching cricket has enabled Choudhry to play at some of the sport’s most iconic grounds – the sort of thing most lovers of the game dream of – and he understands how fortunate he has been.“Now I do coaching sessions at Lord’s, and I’ve played at the Oval too. It’s a big leap from that car park. I can’t quite put it into words how amazing that journey has been.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy. A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

Formerly known as the badlands of the city, the area has now transformed into a lively neighbourhood.Following the , who moved into the music and art hub Kings Place in 2008, the legendary fashion and design school Central Saint Martins, which counts Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney among its alumni, took up residence in neighbouring Granary Square in 2011. More recently, big cultural players including Google, the House of Illustration, Universal Music, the Knowledge Quarter and Time Out have also arrived – bringing with them more people, ideas and creativity.But King’s Cross is far from “all work”. Making use of the Victorian brick viaducts that once held London’s coal store, the bright and airy 20,000 sq ft Coal Drops Yard has taken on a new life as a shopping and dining nirvana. The impossibly stylish redesign – undertaken by the award-winning King’s Cross-based architect, Thomas Heatherwick – is topped off with an already iconic “kissing roof”, which will soon be home to Samsung’s new flagship store.And hang out they do. King’s Cross, which is home to one of the capital’s main railway arteries and the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras, has always been busy with people passing through but, now, it’s a destination in its own right.Already home to an enviable collection of foodie hotspots and cultural highlights – from the KERB food market that sets up for lunch service in Granary Square three days a week, to the nearby British Library and Wellcome Collection, both just a short walk away – when Coal Drops Yard arrived in October 2018, it was seen by many as the icing on the cake. Home to more than 50 stores and restaurants, many of which are young, independent businesses, every archway is filled with thought-provoking products and tantalising flavours.When it comes to fashion, Coal Drops Yard is definitely adding to the conversation, with a unique and eclectic range of brands and boutiques from a three-storey Cos store (which doubles a space to celebrate the art and design that inspires their clothes) and stylish Fred Perry outlet, to independent boutiques such as S120 and Form\u0026ampThread, and menswear heavy-hitters, Universal Works, to name but a few.“We’ve always envisioned King’s Cross as a microcosm of the city – it’s a erse community where people live, work, study and socialise,” explains Anna Strongman, partner at Argent. “In Coal Drops Yard, we’ve aimed to create a unique destination that connects all types of visitors through our combination of shops, restaurants and a vibrant year-round cultural events programme.”With so much change taking place in such a short space of time, it’s fair to say the area’s blossoming into a creative neighbourhood has taken some people by surprise. “When I first moved to London almost seven years ago, I wouldn’t have imagined King’s Cross would be considered a ‘fashion hub,’” says Central Saint Martins alumni and 10 Magazine’s fashion and features assistant, Helena Fletcher.Not everyone is as shocked by the area’s metamorphosis, though. “Generally, when creative industries move into a space in any city, that space then becomes desirable over time,” explains Adam Murray, fashion lecturer at Central Saint Martins.For Henry Graham, creative director and co-founder of Wolf \u0026amp Badger, which has a three-storey concept store in the main yard, Coal Drops Yard is a destination that really stands out from the competition. “In what is an increasingly homogeneous retail landscape, the King’s Cross Central Limited Partnership should be applauded for their courage in proactively seeking out innovative and unique fashion and lifestyle retailers, all of whom, through their stores in Coal Drops Yard, bring a new experience not only to the immediate area but London as a whole,” he says.To discover more about Coal Drop Yard’s unique stores, restaurants and packed diary of cultural events, head to coaldropsyard"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de31a403ff76cc9b3153ba202dd5de3f94666a03/0_0_5500_3300/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db8d310a4e0a81978d0e05aa5faac158","title":"paris fashion week bruno sialelli channels the seaside in lanvin debut","story":"The 31-year-old designer’s first collection looked to the travels of house founder Jeanne Lanvin for inspirationBruno Sialelli may be hard at work as the new boy at Lanvin but he has holidays on the mind. For his first menswear show since his appointment as creative director of the house in January, the French designer mentally took the audience out of sweltering Paris and brought them to the cool breeze of the seaside. In real life, he invited them to a swimming pool in the 19th arrondissement and provided peach ice teas to set the scene.His newly adopted home has been on a journey of its own of late. In the past four years, a series of short-lived creative-director appointments under old management threw the brand into financial and creative chaos. It was a far cry from the headlining company it was under the former creative director, Alber Elbaz, who steered it to 14 years of sustained success before his acrimonious departure in 2015. In 2018, long-term menswear creative director Lucas Ossendrijver left after 14 years, too. As a result, Sialelli – who has worked in the design teams at Balenciaga, Acne, and most recently, Loewe – is the guy everyone is pinning their hopes on to reinvigorate its trajectory.In January, CEO Jean-Philippe Hecquet revealed that Sialelli had been tasked with “bringing back to life this beautiful and unique fashion house, and once again inspire a passion among our customers,” and the 31-year-old designer heard him loud and clear.As with his womenswear collection in January, the new menswear range looked to the life and travels of house founder Jeanne Lanvin for inspiration. This manifested in a mash-up of fabrications, including intarsia knitwear – like tapestries depicting seascapes she would have picked up and brought home – and beaded embellishment, such as trinkets she might have found in a bazaar.The theme of holiday paved way for nautical stripes – in knitwear and seersucker suiting – and sailor collars. Straw holiday hats (the dodgy kind) had hand embroidered Lanvin motifs and bags were the colour of an orange buoy. Mermaid (taken from Lanvin’s antique taps), shell and starfish prints made repeat appearances, while a series of reinterpreted beer-mat prints ticked the ironic box that’s proven an undeterrable trend of late.There’s a new mood to the house that reflects both Sialelli’s youth and experience. His former employer, Loewe, is a venerable lifestyle brand as much as it is a fashion house, with its artistic collaborations and references central to its appeal. For this show, Sialelli channelled the same stimuli, not least with the invitation which was a limited-edition print by the artist and rising star Luke Edward Hall featuring four men in Lanvin-blue swim trunks.Sialelli, however, is targeting a younger audience than his last house as a concept, this was more first freedom than established culture vulture. He said backstage that he wanted to “express something easy and cool and French” with his team who “are excited about working with new languages” and, with this, he is heading in the right direction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e67c69a49101b88b9c4b24751c8f0e019fffd873/0_224_1854_1112/master/1854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9362b72b638b248d24222a42401d34e5","title":"submarine films kursk the last mission","story":"With Kursk the latest deepwater disaster to be dramatised on screen, we plunge into a history of claustrophobia, creaking hulls and deadly phallic warheadsHot on the heels of HBO’s five-parter about the Chernobyl catastrophe comes another story of a tragic accident sparked by cost-cutting and exacerbated by political prevarication. In August 2000, during a Russian naval exercise in the Barents Sea, north of Murmansk, a faulty torpedo exploded in the Kursk – a nuclear-powered submarine named after the Russian city that also lent its name to the largest tank battle in history.Stop reading now if you want to avoid real-life spoilers. The blast instantly killed all crew members in the front two compartments of the submarine, which was sent to the bottom of the sea. Two minutes later, although the nuclear reactor shut down safely, elevated temperatures from the fire detonated as many as seven more torpedos in an explosion that registered 4.2 on the Richter scale as far afield as Alaska, blowing a hole in the bow of the vessel. Of the 118-man crew, 23 survived the explosions and took refuge in the ninth compartment, in the stern of the vessel.The fate of these men is the subject of Kursk: The Last Mission, an English-language Franco-Belgian co-production directed by a Dane (Thomas Vinterberg), adapted by an American (Robert Rodat, who wrote Saving Private Ryan) from Robert Moore’s book A Time to Die, and starring a Belgian (Matthias Schoenaerts) as the senior surviving officer. Other nationalities in the pan-European cast include French (Léa Seydoux as Schoenaerts’ wife), Austrian (Toni Erdmann’s Peter Simonischek) and British (Colin Firth as a Royal Navy CO who looks on in dismay as his offers of help are rejected), as well as assorted Russians, Germans and Scandinavians. Among this last subset is the much-missed Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist, two of whose last three films, before he died in 2017, were submarine movies: Kursk and Hunter Killer, a preposterous yarn starring Gerard Butler as a US captain tasked with saving the Russian president from a coup d’état.Kursk couldn’t be any more different from Hunter Killer, and yet when you make any kind of submarine movie, even a gritty-realist one, it’s hard to avoid dipping into the genre’s repertoire of thrilling tropes: claustrophobia, fire and flood, creaking hulls, dwindling oxygen, an unstable crew member. Other tropes – not present in Kursk – include periscope POV, playing possum, depth charges, silent running, the yell of “Dive! Dive! Dive!”, giant squids and the actor John Mills, whose several submarine outings include Morning Departure (1950), which depicts fictional events eerily similar to those in Kursk.Kursk begins in a 1:66 ratio on land before opening out into 2:35 when the action moves out to sea. For the subaquatic scenes, British cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, who has collaborated with Vinterberg several times, conjures a strange green underwater world. Submarines are nicely suited to widescreen by virtue of their shape, though René Clément made outstanding use of the square-ish Academy ratio in Les Maudits (aka The Damned, 1947), a huis clos set at the end of the second world war about a gaggle of Nazis and collaborators fleeing to South America in a U-boat. The film features an extraordinary extended reverse tracking shot in which a kidnapped French doctor is hustled the length of the cramped submarine – 34 years before Wolfgang Petersen’s breathtaking Steadicam-style sprints through the belly of Das Boot (1981).The phallic symbolism of submarines is fitting for scenarios that tend towards the manly. The pitfalls of introducing women to the equation are well illustrated by Samuel Fuller’s Hell and High Water (1954), one of the first submarine movies filmed in widescreen, even though it did make the interiors look unfeasibly spacious. The lady scientist (Bella Darvi) makes her entrance in tight skirt and heels, causes fights between crew members, and the story grinds to a halt while she and Captain Richard Widmark indulge in horizontal snogging manoeuvres. In real life, women began serving on US submarines in 2011, and there’s at least one token female crew member in Hunter Killer, but I’ll wager we wait a few years before someone gives us a female-centric version of Crimson Tide.After the Kursk sank, the Russian navy waited 11 hours before declaring an emergency, refused help from Norwegian and British rescue teams, and tried to blame the accident on a collision with a foreign vessel. But over the following week, news of the struggle to reach survivors leaked out and caught the imagination of the world. Unlike the rescues of the Chilean miners or the Thai footballer team, however, there was to be no happy ending. There is debate about how long the 23 submariners survived (estimates range from a few hours to several days) but no one made it out of the Kursk alive.Fatally faulty equipment and attempted cover-ups are not exclusive to Russia, of course, though we have yet to see blockbuster movies about, say, the USS Thresher or Challenger space shuttle calamities. But the Soviet era, in particular, seems to lend extra dramatic tension to scenarios such as Chris Gerolmo’s Citizen X, HBO’s superb 1995 film about the hunt for the serial killer Andrei Chikatilo, or Kathryn Bigelow’s underrated K-19: The Widowmaker (2002), a submarine disaster that has more in common with HBO’s Chernobyl (albeit on a much smaller scale) than with Kursk – tragedies amplified by politics and nationalistic pride but also marked by astonishing acts of heroism and integrity.Kursk does well to present the grim facts from the viewpoints of the doomed crew and their families, but it pulls its punches. The disaster was a PR nightmare for Vladimir Putin, then just three months into his presidency, who was on holiday at his Black Sea villa and failed to return to Moscow until four days after the accident. Six days later, his meeting with the bereaved families lurched out of control when he was yelled at by grief-stricken relatives. One dead mariner’s mother who refused to be quiet was forcibly sedated and dragged away, an event caught on film, though edited out of broadcasts in Russia.The incident is recreated in Kursk – but instead of Putin being put on the spot, it is Max von Sydow’s “Admiral Vladimir Petrenko”. Putin, though he featured in Rodat’s original screenplay, is conspicuous by his absence. One theory is that the production company, Luc Besson’s EuropaCorp, was worried about being hacked, mindful of what happened to Sony in 2014 after the unflattering portrayal of Kim Jong-un in the Seth Rogen comedy The Interview. Following the Kursk tragedy, Putin furiously denounced TV and newspaper coverage, and tightened his grip on Russian media.Meanwhile, for anyone curious about the everyday reality of submarine life, I recommend the fascinating “Redditors who have served in submarines” thread, which tells you everything you always wanted to know about “hot racking” and pressurised toilet blowback. The most surprising revelation is that the most realistic submarine movie is not, as you might have expected, the gritty masterpiece Das Boot, but the 1996 slapstick comedy Down Periscope, starring Kelsey Grammer as a captain with “Welcome aboard” tattooed on his penis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aaec8d749e846e8f141924ce71068024d41f187/0_18_2364_1418/master/2364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=249a86c8a06ad189c24fe5ce35ca67a2","title":"teenagers in films coming of age good boys stand by me boyhood","story":"Like Eighth Grade, Boyhood and the new comedy Good Boys, the most authentic coming-of-age movies feature casts still in the throes of adolescence Film has a sometimes troubling relationship with authenticity. However, in coming-of-age films, the authenticity of having child actors in the roles gives the films a certain flair that makes them shine. One notable example is the forthcoming Good Boys, a raucous coming-of-age film for tweenage boys. It features three lead actors who are only a few years older than the 12-year-olds they are playing. There is a touching innocence that marks their performance and produces memorable scenes, such as mistaking their parents’ sex toys for nunchucks and indoor swings. In films about the experience of growing up, there is a certain flavour that can be mimicked but not recreated by older actors.Eighth Grade is another film to be applauded for its awkwardly sweet look at what it means to be a schoolkid in the digital age. Elsie Fisher slots naturally into protagonist Kayla’s hunched posture and curtain of hair that protects her from the outside world. Having started filming almost immediately after finishing eighth grade herself, her performance as Kayla is all the more riveting for the way she taps into her own recent experience. This is what creates the film’s cringey charm.This is hardly a recent phenomenon. Garance Marillier was only 18 when she played Justine in Raw, the French feminist cannibal phenomenon that shocked Cannes with a ferocious portrayal of burgeoning teenage sexuality. Stand By Me has stood the test of time because of the boyhoods of River Phoenix and co, endearing them to new generations of audiences. Richard Linklater’s Boyhood went a step further, taking 12 years to film, while boy actor Ellar Coltrane grew into a young man. Comparing these films to Good Boys and Eighth Grade, it is encouraging to see that the essence of growing up hasn’t changed, even if most of it is now done online.This isn’t always the case. There are a slew of coming-of-age films that feature young adults playing teenage characters – Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever in Booksmart, Saoirse Ronan in Lady Bird, even Rachel McAdams in Mean Girls. They give no less convincing performances because of their age, but there is a subtle difference: because they are recalled rather than recent, their performances are overly enhanced versions of how an adolescent might act. Stockard Channing was 33 when Grease was filmed this reveals itself in Rizzo’s knowing attitude to sex, which stems from Channing’s age and experience. While this makes Rizzo a fan favourite as someone to aspire to, it creates a fiction of adolescence that isn’t realistic for any teenagers watching the film.It doesn’t always work flawlessly. Early Harry Potter films are more vital for their nostalgic value rather than the young trio’s acting chops – but a film series about a young boy navigating his way through wizarding school would have felt false with an adult actor in the main role. We were all teenagers once and have our own experiences of what that was like there is something special that can be learnt from allowing the young to take centre stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/610b8521e8e5c916a50b901e385679344fb0c947/0_8_5313_3187/master/5313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70642c698c52b14879b86aefa5693561","title":"pork chops garlic roast turnips recipe thomasina miers","story":"Rediscover the humble turnip, roasted with garlic and oil, and served with pork chopsIt was the chef Rowley Leigh who alerted me to how good turnips are, with their sweet and delicate flavour.

Mistaking the bald and shining head of the poet for a rock on which to break open his prey, an eagle flying overhead dropped a tortoise. According to legend, the tortoise hit the mark, instantly killing the Greek tragedian who, having returned to the south coast of Sicily in 453BC, was seeking refuge in the wheat-bearing land of Gela.The poet Archestratus was also from Gela. Unlike the bald and unfortunate Aeschylus, Archestratus’ demise was not tragic. In fact, quite the opposite. A proud glutton, Archestratus was a 4th-century BC Jay Rayner, roaming the Mediterranean eating and writing humorous didactic poems advising people where to find the best food, notably fish. Fragments of his poems still exist today, incorporated into The Deipnosophists (The Sophists at Dinner), according to writer Mary Taylor Simeti (whose novel, On Persephone’s Island, and books on Sicilian food I highly recommend). The fragments are a blueprint for modern cookbooks, advising us, for example, how to cook tuna: “Slice it and roast it all rightly, sprinkling just a little salt, and buttering it with oil.”These days, references to Gela are more likely about the looming presence of an oil refinery, or the dark side of the exceptional tomatoes that grow on this section of hot, salted coast. Guide books not only advise you to drive past Gela, but to speed up and avert your eyes. For us, Gela is our summer home the now-defunct oil refinery, with its red-and-white chimney, a stripy landmark as we approach my partner’s home town for a month of family, sausages and red mullet cooked on the roof, bread covered with sesame seeds, days by the sea and watermelons for miles. There’s also salmoriglio, a sauce that flavours our summer and meals, and also one that translates anywhere you can find olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and oregano.Like so many sauce recipes, you don’t really need one for salmoriglio. However, an idea of proportions might help. Pound, crush or very finely chop a clove or two of garlic with a pinch of salt. Add the juice of a lemon (about 100ml), 200ml extra-virgin olive oil and a generous pinch of dried oregano. You can also add a pinch of red chilli or some chopped parsley, if you like. You can make it in the blender – in fact, it creates a cloudy sauce with real texture – but I tend to crush the garlic and salt in a mortar, scrape it into a jar with the oil, lemon and oregano, and shake madly. This also means that leftovers are ready to be stored in the fridge.You can use fresh oregano, if you wish the scent of the small leaves remind you that oregano and mint are relatives. Dried, however, is when oregano comes into its own, with the musty perfume deepening. I used to find oregano perfume unpleasantly strong – dusty, even. I now realise this was because it was forgotten in a drawer for years and years, pulled out and used unknowingly. The flavour of oregano is best brought out by braising, stewing or in residual heat, which is why it is sprinkled in or on top of stews, rather than fried. The best oregano is the kind in dry bunches: rub a stem between your palms over a sheet of kitchen towel, then keep any left over in a jar, and the bunch in a dry place, but not for too long. Alternatively, you can use fresh marjoram.At the Anna Tasca Lanza Cooking School in the Sicilian countryside, they serve salmoriglio in a gravy boat to be poured on warm vegetables: steamed broccoli, slices of courgette or heaps of steamed greens. “Pass me that boat of deliciousness,” asked my friend the last time we were at the school.In Gela, I marinate thick slices of aubergine in salmoriglio (or, as my father-in-law says, “salamarigghiu”), leaving them for about 20 minutes so they sop up the flavours, before searing them on a ridged grill. I also marinate fish (swordfish or cernia) or grill whole fillets on our bandy-legged charcoal grill, then pour over the sauce while still hot off the grill. Heat is important for salmoriglio: it wakes up the flavours like an alarm – especially the garlic and oregano, with its musty, peppery perfume, inseparable from the harshly beautiful and shrubby Sicilian landscape where it grows, and tortoises fall."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc413b9bde22cc4ab6e5862bf3da38688e036c20/0_34_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc845bf10679ce0abfe5413127d5583b","title":"england fans cameroon world cup escorted stadium tensions","story":"England fans have told how they were escorted from the ground following the 3-0 defeat of Cameroon after tensions flared in the crowd.One group of supporters, who wish to remain anonymous, told the  that a set of Cameroon fans had been allowed to move from their allocated seats and gather near them. Initially the atmosphere was good.“Cameroon fans next to us were in full voice creating a great atmosphere,” they said. “There were a few issues with the stewards early on because they were in the wrong seats but they continued to sing and cheer.”Usually the lack of segregation of fans is not a problem in women’s football but, as tensions rose on the pitch, Cameroonian frustration at VAR decisions was reflected in the stands.“Once the VAR decisions happened, the atmosphere soured off the pitch as much as on the pitch,” reported the England fans. “Some fans became quite aggressive with stewards, one or two pushed stewards and were led out. There was also verbal abuse aimed at anybody in Fifa gear on the pitch at half-time.“Just as people calmed down, the second-half disallowed goal kicked it all off again. It didn’t help that Fifa kept showing the replays on screen. A couple of people threw cups on to the pitch at one point. We felt safe, just very uncomfortable.“The aggression and hostility was very much aimed at Fifa but I think not knowing what was going to happen on the pitch and how that could impact the fans was a little nervy. It’s not something we’ve ever experienced before at a game. Security lined the steps between our stand and theirs and officials escorted us out of the stadium through the VIP area.”Fifa said in a statement: “The post-match debrief highlighted that a number of Cameroon fans had moved to the seats behind the team benches during the match in order to create a ‘fan block’.“This required management by stadium stewards who, in the interests of all spectators, moved other ticket holders into hospitality seating. Although there was some verbal exchange between Cameroon supporters and stewards, there has been no report of any physical confrontation.”Fifa is expected to comment further on events around the match, which included Cameroon players twice engulfing the referee and refusing to restart the game following the intervention of VAR.The president of the women’s football committee at the Confederation of African Football, Isha Johansen, who is president of the Sierra Leone FA, said: “Whilst remaining proud of our African teams that participated in the Fifa Women’s World Cup, yesterday’s match between England and Cameroon reflected badly, not only on African women’s football, but African football on the whole.“It is an issue which will be addressed and dealt with, at the appropriate levels of governance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a2bb6bda089c2ac088b8315c87af0498770fb6/153_280_1831_1098/master/1831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb8c67f4ea133b48c3f002f28252adc4","title":"manchester united crystal palace aaron wan bissaka deal improved offer zaha","story":"Manchester United and Crystal Palace officials will meet on Monday afternoon with a view to thrashing out the finer details of a deal to take Aaron Wan-Bissaka to Old Trafford after an improved bid was tabled over the weekend.Talks between the clubs appeared to have broken down late last week with United’s offers having fallen well short of Palace’s valuation of the England Under-21 defender. The Palace chairman, Steve Parish, who is under no real pressure to sell, has consistently sought to raise a guaranteed £50m for an academy graduate who excelled while making 39 appearances over his first full season in the senior set-up last term, and that stance has not shifted.The south London club had also been keen to cancel, or at least reduce, a sell-on clause inserted in the deal which took Wilfried Zaha back to Selhurst Park from United in January 2015. That could be worth as much as £15m to the selling club if the Ivory Coast forward leaves.The latest bid submitted by United fell slightly short of the money Palace are seeking but offered scope for negotiation in the hope compromise can be reached. Palace will still push for the removal of Zaha’s clause when talks resume with Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman, and Matt Judge, their head of corporate development, in London. Wan-Bissaka is keen for the move to happen.Two bids had already been rejected out of hand. The second is understood to have guaranteed only £35m for the 21-year-old right-back, with a further £15m dependent upon personal and collective honours. Palace considered those performance-related clauses – some are believed to relate to United, who finished sixth last term, winning the Champions League – to be wildly unrealistic.With suggestions abounding that Wan-Bissaka, who is under contract until 2022, has agreed terms on an £80,000-a-week deal with United, Palace made clear their frustrations going into the weekend and effectively challenged Woodward to match their asking price or walk away.Wan-Bissaka, who first broke into the Palace first-team in the spring of 2018, is with the England Under-21s at the European Championship. He endured a torrid evening in their opening group game, scoring a stoppage-time own goal as Aidy Boothroyd’s side slipped to defeat by France. He was omitted for Friday’s 4-2 defeat by Romania, with England to conclude an anticlimactic tournament against Croatia in San Marino on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7dfa250892bc3f80b84b0329c00796c9d8404ad/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87c256d8274311e5bc67c6c069c9247c","title":"rafael benitez leaving newcastle contract expires 30 june","story":"Rafael Benítez will leave Newcastle when his contract expires on Sunday, the club have announced.Newcastle said in a statement: “It is with disappointment that we announce manager Rafael Benítez will leave Newcastle United upon the expiry of his contract on June 30, 2019.“We have worked hard to extend Rafa’s contract over a significant period of time, however it has not been – and will not be – possible to reach an agreement with Rafa and his representatives.“Rafa’s coaching staff, Paco de Miguel Moreno, Antonio Gómez Pérez and Mikel Antia, will also leave the club on June 30.“We would like to thank Rafa and his coaching team for their efforts over the last three years and their significant contribution to what has been collectively achieved.“We would also like to thank our supporters, players and staff for their patience during a period of uncertainty.

Ever since he had watched Joel Stransky execute his drop goal at Ellis Park six months earlier the head coach felt Bafana Bafana had taken on some emotional freight.The South Africa rugby team had made the most of their hosting a showpiece could the football team do the same? The pressure was not spoken so much as strongly hinted at, as Barker sensed when one weekend in Durban well ahead of the Afcon his eight-year-old niece, Suzie, called to him that he had a phone call. “It’s Nelson,” said the schoolgirl, “and he says he wants to talk to you, Uncle Clive.”Over the following months the president engaged with Barker and the team regularly, privately inspiring, publicly nation-building. “He brought an extra pressure because he made sure you got the sort of message: ‘You know what happened with the rugby,’” recalls Barker. “But he was great with the players, always asking after their families, very hands-on when he mingled with them. Sometimes he would bring his grandchildren to the hotel. It was a real influence on us.’In his let-the-games-begin speech Nelson Mandela had talked of ‘Africa rising’. And it was: Cameroon broke through a glass ceiling at the first World Cup of the 1990s, Nigeria performed thrillingly at the second, and, three weeks before the 1996 Afcon, an African international had for the first time been awarded the Ballon d’Or, the sport’s highest inidual accolade. That was George Weah, of Milan, and captain of Liberia. Weah arrived at Durban airport before Liberia’s first fixture with a regal bearing and a faint aura of entitlement. He was probably due it. The best footballer in the world was in the habit of funding flights, hotels and equipment for the cash-strapped Liberia team, as well as scoring and setting up a very high proportion of their goals.Meanwhile, in Port Elizabeth, a star-studded Ghana would be led by Abedi Pele, the playmaker and former Champions League winner with Marseille. Up front was Tony Yeboah, whose muscular performances and astonishing goals from long range for Leeds United had made Philomen Masinga something of an understudy at that club.Yeboah, Lucas Radebe and Masinga – the Leeds brigade – shared plenty of chatter about the tournament in the lead-up, though as Christmas approached it looked unlikely that all three would be participating. Radebe’s knee problem was grave. He had had cruciate-ligament surgery in late March 1995 and it was only by December that he felt tentatively recovered. Barker had a series of terse, vexed calls with Howard Wilkinson, the successful and stubborn manager of Leeds, about Radebe’s readiness. Eventually Radebe himself intervened in the tug-of-war, explaining to Wilkinson that Bafana Bafana was a matter of the heart, and a home Afcon a once-in-a-career event.Radebe sat in the stands at Soccer City for the opening game against Cameroon. A week later he crossed a significant threshold, trotting on to a wet pitch as a substitute for the final 13 minutes of the next group match, against Angola. Mark Williams, once again the penalty-box predator, quickest to a loose ball, had given Bafana Bafana a 1–0 lead. Radebe came on to help insure it, and to test his knee.This was welcome news for a Bafana Bafana who could begin to plan for the knockouts. A fortnight after cutting through Cameroon they met Algeria for a place in the last four at Soccer City. Doctor Khumalo had a first-half penalty saved just when the contest seemed to plead for some calm. Happily, into this pell-mell ed Mark Fish, stabbing at Masinga’s neat lay-off to put Bafana Bafana ahead with 18 minutes left. The South Africa defender was, alas, then beaten to a header for Algeria’s equaliser, nodded in from a corner. John ‘Shoes’ Moshoeu settled any debate almost instantly, with an arrowed shot from outside the Algeria penalty area: 2–1 to the hosts. The open bowl of a soaked Soccer City turned into a jelly of bouncing umbrellas.The big setback, though, was Masinga’s booking. He would be out of the semi-final, to where Ghana were en route, having defeated Zaire in Port Elizabeth, thanks to a goal from Yeboah. Twice the leading goalscorer in Germany’s Bundesliga, and with 22 Premier League goals in less than a year since he had joined Leeds, he had carried his club form to the Nations Cup. Such was Yeboah’s broad skill-set that there was a logic in assigning a dedicated marker to him. Barker had a volunteer. “I won’t let you down,” Radebe told his coach. As the teams lined up, Yeboah greeted his Leeds colleague, and made mention of the long injury. “Take it easy,” said Yeboah to Radebe, “you don’t want to hurt that knee again.”Thus began the duel, the riveting centrepiece to the semi-final. First strike to Yeboah. Radebe, playing a straightforward pass across the defence, underhit it terribly. Yeboah pounced, teed up a confrontation with the goalkeeper, Andre Arendse, and the rapt crowd, hearts in mouths, watched the Ghanaian waste the opportunity. There were no further gifts but rather an exemplary study in adhesive man-marking. Radebe became Yeboah’s shadow.At the other end of the pitch South Africa turned on the style with another Moshoeu showreel. He took Bafana Bafana’s first bold step to the final in spectacular fashion, planting a volley into the Ghanaian goal. Very soon after half-time Shaun Bartlett, in for the suspended Masinga, finished off a move begun by Radebe to thump Bafana Bafana two goals in front. Another Moshoeu virtuoso made it 3–0, with three minutes to go.South Africa would now be meeting Tunisia, whose progress to the final had turned ominously stealthy. They had lost to Ghana in the group stage, squeaked past Gabon via a penalty shootout in the last eight and then apparently come into blossom as 4–2 winners against Zambia.Barker then had a harder piece of information to give out: Williams was to be left out of the starting XI. Barker had seen Bartlett lead the line impressively against Ghana, and Masinga – the most naturally gifted of his strikers – was back from suspension. Setting out on the journey from Parktown to Soccer City, where spectators – thousands without tickets – had gathered many hours before kick-off, Williams was crestfallen. “It was a bit quiet in the bus,” recalls Barker, “and Mark sensed it. So then he got up and started dancing and singing and I thought: ‘What a great team man.’ I wouldn’t have taken it so lightly.”Come the final, Williams waited restlessly through a goalless, tense first hour. He heard Barker bellow, “What the fuck are you doing?” at Fish for an unauthorised ramble upfield, and then, as he trotted up the touchline, Williams hatched a plan. “They tell me that when he was warming up as a substitute, Mark Williams was telling the crowd, ‘Get the coach to play me!’” smiles Barker. “Well, he got his chance.”Williams came on for Masinga in the 65th minute, the score still 0–0. In the 73rd a Doctor Khumalo free-kick picked out Fish, whose header fell to Eric Tinkler and, via a blocked effort, to the full-back Sizwe Motaung. From his cross, Williams headed the breakthrough goal. Two minutes later South Africa’s snubbed supersub did it again, Williams guiding a Khumalo through-ball across the goalkeeper with a purposeful left-footed finish, his fourth goal of the tournament and the end of Tunisia’s ambitions.

More than six in 10 Algerians, and four in 10 Sudanese, believe the last elections were not free and fair, the survey found.Michael Robbins, the director of Arab Barometer, said the survey – which was conducted at random in private and face-to-face, and consisted largely of multiple-choice questions answered on a tablet – presented a number of significant findings.“Most importantly, in the vast majority of countries surveyed, governments are not meeting the expectations of their citizens,” said Robbins.“Often, trust in government tracks more closely with performance on providing security than on economic issues.”Respondents expressed a change in attitudes over a number of other issues, from migration and mental health to women’s and LGBT rights.Across the region, most respondents supported a woman’s right to orce her husband but felt that husbands rather than wives should have the final say on family decisions.The notion of a female political president or prime minister was most acceptable in Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia, and least acceptable in Algeria and Sudan.Dima Dabbous, Equality Now’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said the apparent contradiction in responses was “indicative of the dominant mood in the region”.“There is a realisation that gender equality is a marker of progress and the ‘right thing’ to say is to support women empowerment. But when the framing of the question focuses on the role of men, then the real patriarchal, male-centric bias comes to the surface,” said Dabbous.“Women in the Middle East and North Africa are getting more educated and participating increasingly in the labour force, but their empowerment will remain incomplete as long as they are still excluded from decision-making positions and political participation.”For taboo or difficult questions, respondents were asked to select “acceptable practices” from a series of options. People believed “honour” killings were more acceptable than being gay in all but one of the countries where this question was asked (Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, Sudan and Tunisia).Dabbous said the responses demonstrated a machismo still heavily prevalent across the region."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f345508d0a6826ed2fd0a61d2351bd873912fed/0_0_6347_3808/master/6347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c88efa4a21e3e33dc066ee3383ff0c49","title":"home office stranded mother baby home from pakistan","story":"Visa decision overturned for British resident Nina Saleh, 48 hours after  and others published her storyA woman who was refused a visa to return to London after travelling to Pakistan to adopt a baby has been told she can come home.Nina Saleh has a Norwegian passport but full UK residency rights after living in London for 20 years. She was refused a visa to return home with baby Sofia three times, despite going through a stringent and lengthy adoption process in the UK with British authorities’ involvement.Within 48 hours of the  and others publishing her story, Saleh received news that the Home Office was overturning its decision and allowing her back home.Speaking from Karachi, where she has spent four months waiting for her case to be resolved, Saleh told the  she had almost lost hope of ever getting home.“Just this morning I was crying my eyes out. My friend who was also adopting here got her visa yesterday and was dreading telling me. We met through the adoption process, we were all in the same WhatsApp group. Obviously I was happy for her but I felt so upset for me and for Sofia. I was crying so much. I thought this would never end.“Then my lawyer called and said it got overturned, and now I am so happy.“The media pressure was instrumental in getting this overturned. I think it’s alarming how unprofessional the Home Office is. Since February they have stopped me from getting on with my life and I am left feeling still traumatised and highly vulnerable.”Saleh’s solicitor in the UK, Saimah Razzaq, at the Immigration Advice Service, told the  earlier this week that the Home Office had been “negligent” by not applying the correct regulations to let her come home.Saleh was originally refused on the basis that adoption is not allowed from Pakistan to the UK as there is no intra-country adoption agreement. However, couples or iniduals coming from the UK use an established route of getting legal ship of the baby and then travelling back to Britain, where the authorities formalise the adoption process.Saleh says she is still angry with her treatment by the Home Office, who, she says, did not look properly at her three applications.“I had a very stringent, lengthy process in the UK, led by UK social services. A social worker visited me at home for two hours a week, for a year. They knew I was coming here to Pakistan. The Department of Education, who have approved me for adoption, knew I was coming to Pakistan.“It’s actually disgusting reading the letter they sent today. They have blamed me for using the word ‘adoptive’ mother when the adoption hasn’t been finalised yet. But I had provided reams of evidence, detailing the legal process of ship in Pakistan.”She told the  that she believes she was refused a visa because of her status as an EEA national, despite having lived for so long in the UK.“I believe I am being treated like a second-class citizen because I have Norwegian citizenship. The two other couples I travelled with, one British, one a mixed British-European national, both returned easily to the UK with their babies.“You know, I fought this for months but somebody else might not feel that brave. I expected delays or problems in Pakistan, but actually they were so professional this side. The Home Office was a complete shambles and totally unaccountable.”Saleh expects to be home within two weeks, but her family, many of whom are in Norway, are already on their way to London.“They want to get everything ready for me. My mum is just overwhelmed.”She still feels sad about what her family have missed over the first months of Sofia’s life. “My mum turned 70 in April. I expected to be home way before then so … Sofia and I missed her birthday, and that is really sad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f65f36f98f5c08449ef6b7852b0c3bf1b6e835/0_300_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6073d16bfca977095068f6ec2cddbd7f","title":"andy mcnab at the age of 16 i learned to read and that knowledge was everything","story":"When he joined the army, the author had the reading age of an 11-year-old. But he can still remember the pride he felt at reading his first bookI joined the army straight out of juvenile detention at the age of 16. I was no criminal mastermind – I burgled the same block of flats repeatedly and was always going to end up getting caught.The education system had failed me I had attended nine schools in seven years and I didn’t see the point of it. I wanted to be a panel beater or a tube driver I had heard they made loads of money and you didn’t need much education for those kind of jobs. So that was it – why bother going to school? All I needed was to get a council flat, and I had that cracked because my parents were already on the list. All that was left was a Mark II Ford Escort and that would be me made.As it was, I was heading down a path that eventually led me to prison. Despite what Only Fools and Horses would have you believe, Peckham was never full of Del Boy cheeky chappies, having a laugh on the market then going off to drink cocktails in the pub. It was full of unemployment, drugs, guns and mindless vandalism. As a teenager I felt angry with people who had shiny new cars or spotless motorbikes, simply because they had stuff and I didn’t. So I used to kick their cars and bikes in, just because I could. I would vandalise people’s shops and mess up their goods, because they had it and I didn’t.It was while I was in juvenile detention that the army recruitment guys turned up and offered us an early release if we joined up. It sounded better than prison, so off I went. But the army turned my life around by opening my eyes and showing me that there were opportunities if I took the initiative and made something of myself. If I was willing to put in the effort.When my world truly changed for the better, I was in a classroom, alongside about 20 other boy soldiers, with an old sweat of a captain standing up front. He pointed out of the window, towards the barbed wire fence and the real world beyond, saying: “Out there, they think you are all thick. But you’re not. The only reason you can’t read or write is because you don’t read or write. But from today that all changes.”And it did. I soon learned that the reason I hadn’t been able to join the army as a helicopter pilot, as I had hoped, and had ended up in the infantry instead, was because I had the literacy and numeracy levels of an 11-year-old. I had no idea that I had a reading age that low I had just made words up when I didn’t know them, and usually ended up getting them wrong.It was just before I turned 17 that I read my very first book: Janet and John Book 10. I can vividly remember the sense of pride and achievement I felt. It was meant for primary school children but I didn’t care. I had read a whole book, and I was hooked. From then on I read anything and everything I could get my hands on. Of course it took me a while to catch up with where I should have been, but whether it was a tabloid newspaper, a car magazine or a book, I just wanted to try to get as much knowledge as I could.I learned in those early days at the army education centre, and then again when I joined the SAS, that the most important thing you have is knowledge. There are always people falling over themselves to help you and teach you stuff, and you are never going to progress unless you keep learning. Literacy and numeracy levels for the average infantry recruit joining up now are still relatively low, and the incredible educational opportunities that the army offers makes it one of the few places with decent social mobility in the UK.For me, improving my literacy levels had another more surprising outcome. When I left the SAS, I was asked to write an account of the Brave Two Zero mission and that led to the unexpected career change of becoming an author.I have spent quite a bit of time over the past few years visiting schools, prisons and workplaces, as well as army bases and businesses, to talk about my past and encouraging others to start reading and writing. The guys joining up now still have the opportunity to change their lives, just as I did. The message I give to all the lads that I chat to is that if I can do it, anyone can. If that is a message that even one of them takes on board and uses, then it has been worthwhile.

While watching the HBO show High Maintenance, I noticed that Lee, the protagonist’s hip and beautiful love interest, was sporting hairy armpits.“Look!” I cried to my husband, as though I’d unexpectedly spotted a T-shirt emblazoned with the name of my favorite obscure band. For the past couple of decades, I have seldom shaved my armpits. Now, all of a sudden, I was on-trend.Among both celebrities and the masses, female body hair is sprouting all over. Ilana of Broad City has exposed her underarm growth so have Jemima Kirke and Zazie Beetz. In January of this year, Laura Jackson, a British college student, ran a campaign called “Januhairy,” urging women to grow out their body hair and post selfies on Instagram.In some ways, this phenomenon harks back to the second wave movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when feminists began to challenge restrictive beauty standards. At a famous march outside the 1968 Miss America pageant in Atlantic City, protesters ceremoniously discarded their bras and stiletto heels many feminists of that era also ditched their razors and tweezers. But today’s renewed enthusiasm for female hirsuteness comes with a distinctly 21st-century twist.Unshaven women in 2019 often meet other criteria for traditional feminine beauty –they have sculpted eyebrows, wear lipstick or sexy lingerie – while proudly displaying their armpit hair. If the ethos of the 70s was a refusal to spend time and effort on cosmetics, the more common approach today is for women to curate different elements of their appearance, remaining conventionally attractive while deploying body hair as a feminist fuck-you: half-statement, half-ornament.Enter Billie, a New York-based subscription service that sells “razors built for womankind”. In January, the company announced a $25m investment from Goldman Sachs and other backers.Billie’s most radical feminist move is to show, in its various promotional materials, women removing actual hair from their bodies: models dragging razors up shaggy, moistened legs. As the company’s web copy notes, “Commercials show women ‘shaving’ perfectly smooth, airbrushed legs. Strange, huh?” In a move that is either generously self-undermining or shrewdly opportunistic (or both), Billie also runs Project Body Hair, an image library of hair in all sorts of places it’s not supposed to be.One of Billie’s models is Hale, a 19-year-old musician and student at Bard College. On Billie’s website, Hale sits on the floor against a bed, wearing a frilled white tank top. She is smoothing the hair on her head back with arms raised, revealing undisturbed axillary fuzz.Hale hit puberty early, she told me, and her body hair was dark and noticeable. At one point, “I shaved literally everything,” she said. “I shaved my whole stomach when I was in elementary school, because I didn’t like my happy trail.” But in high school, she began to question the hairlessness ideal, and realized that “having autonomy over my body didn’t make me less attractive or less valuable”. Now, she sometimes, but not always, removes hair from her legs and other body parts, but never from her armpits. Until recently she waxed her unibrow, but as it grows back, she’s started to think it’s “really cute”.Billie’s branding strategy may come across as fishy – they do sell razors, after all. But it seems to fit right in with the emerging ethos around body hair: celebrating women’s choices as a hodgepodge of inidual decisions about how to adhere to or violate cultural norms.As Georgina Gooley, Billie’s 33-year-old Australian-born co-founder, told me, “If you choose to shave, we have a great product for you. If you don’t, we have other products as well.” (The company also sells lotion and body wash.) With Project Body Hair, she says, “We weren’t sending the message that shaving is an expectation. We were saying shaving is a choice.”Back in the 1970s, the conversation sounded quite different. As Rebecca Herzig writes in her 2015 book Plucked: A History of Hair Removal, two camps emerged in the second wave movement.The very first full issue of Ms. Magazine, in July of 1972, featured an article titled Body Hair: The Last Frontier. It criticized the shaving norm as an “embodiment of our culture’s preoccupation with keeping women in a kind of state of innocence, and denying their visceral selves”. The time, money and psychological energy required for depilation were oppressive. Hairlessness was also infantilizing – it made women look like prepubescent girls. The social norm suggested, not very subtly, that there was something inherently wrong, gross and dirty about women’s bodies as they naturally were.But another faction of feminists, led by Betty Friedan, had a different take. Friedan believed the preoccupation with body hair was counterproductive. She considered these concerns a trivial distraction from more important issues, such as professional opportunities and subsidized childcare. She also thought they harmed the cause of feminism by casting feminists as hairy, ugly, man-hating weirdos.I came of age in the 1990s, a midway point of sorts. My two best friends and I stopped shaving in high school. For me, this decision was not explicitly about feminism, but about an allegiance to my idea of authenticity (not to mention my allegiance to laziness). It wasn’t that I didn’t care how I looked I wanted to look like I didn’t care how I looked. I wanted to be attractive, but I did not want to invest effort or enlist artifice into making myself so. Any such measures, to my 16-year-old mind, would have been cheating.At the same time, I usually felt self-conscious about my body hair, and often wore pants or long skirts. Displaying smooth, bald legs would have felt like selling out, but I felt a different sort of discomfort displaying hairy ones. I envied one of my friends whose leg hair was fine and wispy. Mine was not. (Later I resumed shaving my legs.)Back then, in my recollection, body hair did not register much in the cultural conversation. The founders of Instagram were in middle school. Feminism was in something of a lull, with a few exceptions such as the Riot Grrrl scene. My favorite magazine, Sassy, did embrace feminism, but not in a way that involved challenging beauty norms very aggressively. As far as I recall, nary a patch of stubble could be found on the waifish bodies of their models.It’s hard to say exactly when what Hale refers to as the new “body-hair movement” emerged – she describes it as “non-boys taking up space and deciding that they’re not going to adjust to the norms”.But she remembers thinking something was afoot when dyed armpit hair became fashionable a few years ago. One of the pioneers of that micro-trend was Roxie Jane Hunt, a hairstylist in Seattle.Hunt, 35, shaved as a teenager, but, she says, “I always hated the action of doing it. It felt like a big chore but also a little bit of violence against my own body.” When her daughter was about two, she saw Hunt shaving and asked her why. “I realized I didn’t have a good enough answer,” Hunt says. She grew out her armpit hair, and found it “much more sexy and natural”.In 2014, on a lark, she and a friend dyed their underarm hair “ethereal blue”, and Hunt posted photos of the colorful pits on her blog. “The blogpost kind of went viral from there,” she says. She described the attitude with which they approached the exercise as “sort of joy. It opened up a little more imagination.” Many people have since posted pictures of their “unicorn pits”, dyed in all the colors of the rainbow.If body hair has historically been invisible – too shameful to even show in razor commercials – this aesthetic makes it ultra-visible. In that sense, it takes the pro-hair ethos to its extreme. But in another sense, this practice is the opposite of the “let it all hang out” approach: it is, after all, hard to think of a grooming choice less natural, less laissez-faire, than polychromatic armpit hair.The look is also highly social-mediagenic, destined for virality. And social media, for both dyed and virgin body hair, is obviously a key part of what makes this round of hair affirmation different from previous eras. Women are not only refusing to conceal their body hair they’re flaunting it.A long-running debate within feminism has been whether we should respect women’s choices – even if they seem to result from oppression – or whether only certain “liberated” choices merit approval. The new body-hair acceptance advocates land squarely in the former territory. When I was growing up, a common catchphrase was “I’m not a feminist, but …” followed by some statement of support for feminist principles, such as equal pay. Now, much more common is something like the reverse: claiming the mantle of feminism no matter how un-feminist the position may seem.A theme that came through loudly in my conversations with young women was that we should judge nothing – except perhaps judgment itself. “I think the 70s wave of feminism was outright rejecting femininity. We don’t need makeup, we don’t want to be housewives,” said Ashley Armitage, a 25-year-old photographer who shot one of the Billie marketing campaigns. “Now it’s like, wait a second, you can be a feminist and a housewife. You can shave.”Surveying this new world of body hair, I wondered: are women making these choices because they think body hair is feminine, or despite the fact that they don’t think it’s feminine? Is there ever tension between their aesthetic preferences and their values?Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the prevalent reluctance to judge, no one wanted to say that they didn’t like any particular aesthetic choice. According to Gooley, the Billie co-founder, she found a range of attitudes in her focus groups and market research. Some women think “it’s a patriarchal view to force women to shave. Other women are like, ‘I just think it’s really cute. I like my underarm hair.’”Just as there’s a mix of motives, there’s also a series of decisions – not a one-time resolution to always shave everything or never shave anything. “So many people, maybe sometimes they’ll shave, sometimes they’ll grow their hair out,” says Armitage. “Sometimes they’ll shave their legs, sometimes they’ll grow their armpit hair.” Considering this reality, Billie’s pitch starts to make a little more sense.So far, this is all sounding very kumbaya: the shaven and the waxed and the hairy and the semi-hairy all getting along famously, showering each other with love and likes in a judgment-free festival. There is some truth to that: this discourse is refreshingly peaceable.But of course, it’s not all rainbows and unicorns. For all the love that the photos of body hair have generated, they have also, inevitably, attracted trolls. MaryV Benoit, another Billie model, told me about the comments on the campaign: “Seventy percent of them would be, ‘Oh, that is awesome.’ Thirty percent would be these weird men that would be like, ‘You girls need to shave.’” Some of the comments were nastier. And some came from women.Posting a picture of your hairy self online takes guts. You know that not everyone will approve, and some will let you know it. Merely going out in public with female body hair takes a different sort of courage. You’re less likely to hear direct insults, but more likely to get funny looks, unmediated by a screen.Female hairiness is still far from mainstream. But the more people who brave the all-caps comments and the whispers and stares, the less shocking it becomes. This is how norms change. And one of the few real upsides of social media, in my view, is its power to accelerate that process of dismantling dubious norms – not, in this case, in order to replace the old one with a new, equally unforgiving one, but to challenge the need for any norm at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a74ee093c5dd572948dc4014a9bed8418a1d9d38/0_309_4632_2779/master/4632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca107c0d336ffea707aa0e8aee36b79a","title":"eagles review wembley stadium","story":"Wembley Stadium, LondonNo amount of polish can help their less inspired material, but there are moments when the country-rockers sound heavenlyTheir split was so severe that they titled their by-no-means-inevitable 1994 reunion album Hell Freezes Over, but now it seems not even the death of co-founder Glenn Frey in 2016 can halt the Eagles. Now 44 years after they first played Wembley, Frey’s co-anchor Don Henley (lean, intense, could be played by Bryan Cranston in the biopic) acknowledges the group’s Jurassic status, but adds that “dinosaurs leave big footprints”. And it’s true: the Eagles brought professionalism and a certain Hollywood gloss to raggedy country-rock, and were rewarded with genuinely phenomenal commercial success.And it’s to “carry on Glenn’s legacy” that Henley persists, aided by longtime bandmates Joe Walsh and Timothy B Schmit, with country legend Vince Gill and Frey’s son Deacon singing Glenn’s songs. If the show betrays the static slickness typical of such legacy groups, there are moments, like on Take It to the Limit, when the Eagles’ trademark multi-part harmonies sound ageless and heavenly. Meanwhile, the yearning, lachrymose storytelling of Frey’s Lyin’ Eyes strikes a winning balance with the glamorous ennui of Henley’s more cynical songs, such as One of These Nights.A traffic jam of soft-rockers stuck in the same gear yield a saggy mid-set malaise, the group’s trademark polish smothering less inspired material. But Walsh, the group’s resident gurning rock’n’roll maverick, kickstarts a late-set rally with his own raucous Walk Away and the acid-rock wig-out of Funk #49 (by his 60s power-trio James Gang), before Henley answers with his post-Eagles solo hit The Boys of Summer perhaps his best song, its air of disillusionment and betrayal has grown only more resonant with the years. The paranoid, cocaine-cowboy vibe of Life in the Fast Lane, meanwhile, conjures an edge the show often lacks.Hotel California arrives in the encore, of course, by now the Eagles’ own Stairway to Heaven: overplayed, overfamiliar, ultimately underwhelming and packing a similarly iconic guitar solo which, once Steuart Smith begins it, feels like it’s never going to end. And you sense that Henley – the dinosaur who refuses to even consider extinction, still selling out stadiums – would be fine with that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a415792fbc0f160bfacd62c6aa5d169bbb5e3523/0_323_4821_2892/master/4821.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=596fe7a667127e0d158cd06d0a3f1f4c","title":"brexit party peterborough byelection postal vote","story":"Nigel Farage says investigation is needed after Labour won in Peterborough by 683 votesThe Brexit party is to launch a formal legal challenge against the result of this month’s Peterborough byelection, where it was narrowly beaten by Labour, claiming that allegations of corruption connected to postal votes need to be investigated.Nigel Farage, the party’s leader, insisted the challenge was about more than the loss to Labour by 683 votes, saying the wider use of postal votes was open to abuse and needed to be investigated.“I know people will say: ‘Oh, but it’s sour grapes.’ It isn’t,” Farage told a press conference in London.“Actually, as far as I’m concerned, this is about a lot more than Peterborough. It is about a system that is wide open to corruption, to intimidation, to bribery, to abuse on a whole number of levels. I have mentioned this a number of times in the past.”The party plans to issue a petition under the 1983 Representation of the People Act, which allows election results to be challenged retrospectively for reasons including errors or corruption connected to the polling.Such challenges are rare, with the last successful one coming in 2010, when the Labour minister Phil Woolas was ejected from his Oldham East and Saddleworth constituency after a specially convened election court upheld a complaint that Woolas had knowingly lied about his Lib Dem opponent.Police investigated five complaints connected to the Peterborough byelection on 6 June, in which Labour’s Lisa Forbes defeated the Brexit party’s Mike Greene in a vote Farage’s new organisation had been tipped to win.Labour has rejected any wrongdoing, and police have ruled that no offences were committed in three of the five complaints so far looked at.The Brexit party chair, Richard Tice, conceded that the evidence so far seemed uncertain, but said that was why a full investigation was required.“You’re absolutely right – there are a lot of rumours, a lot of hearsay, some of which is just that,” Tice said. “There is evidence emerging. That will be presented to the electoral court. It’s wrong to prejudge that, or announce that now.“It’s only by having a full petition that we can truly get to the bottom of what may or may not have happened here, but also the lessons for the broader system.”He said there were many unanswered issues: “Why were there rumours that morning that the Labour party had won by 500 votes? There are so many questions. We need answers. And the only mechanism available to us to give us those answers is to lodge a petition under the Representation of the People Act 1983. So we will be doing that this week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be0d7a831f0ba9a41a39d126ad63c1439f61229e/0_117_6720_4031/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6a70fd3ae4d7641ac6a07f469e5f9fd","title":"however look logic brexit backstop refuses to yield irish","story":"None of the options proposed as a solution to keeping the Irish border looks workableThe question, set less by Brussels than the logic of Brexit, is how the UK government can in one move leave the European union’s single market and customs while also maintaining the flow of trade and people on its one land border with the bloc in IrelandThe fact that the existence of the land border in question cost more than 3,600 lives over 30 years led to the British government in December 2017 restating its commitment to avoid “a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls”.Avoiding a backdoor for smugglers into the single market is additionally regarded as essential by Dublin and the European commission, as is avoiding crippling extra bureaucracy on Irish businesses.The so-called Irish backstop in the 585-page withdrawal agreement – to remain in place “unless and until” an alternative solution for keeping the border open is found – offers one solution by doing two key things.First, Northern Ireland stays within the EU’s regulatory regime, and under direct jurisdiction of the European court of justice, so as to allow a single market for goods on the island of Ireland.Second, the whole of the UK shares a customs territory with the EU to avoid any checks on goods both between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.But rejected three times by the Commons on the grounds that the UK could be tied into the backstop indefinitely, leaving the government unable to sign its own comprehensive trade deals, the withdrawal agreement is said by Boris Johnson, still the frontrunner in the Tory leadership battle, to be “defunct”.What is the alternative? In recent days, Johnson has suggested that the EU and UK could give themselves more time to work on the problem by relying on “Gatt 24 or whatever it happens to be” to provide for a “standstill in our current arrangements”.Under article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, tariffs would remain at zero even under an no deal exit on 31 October for up to a decade, it is said. The agreement could additionally leave the Irish border open while the two sides sought a new accommodation.The problem for Johnson, in the words of the trade secretary Liam Fox, is that this “isn’t true”. Article XXIV is only relevant if there is an an agreement in principle on a free trade deal. It provides the two parties time to turn an interim deal into a final one.But the EU has said that the first and necessary step towards a trade deal is ratification of the withdrawal agreement. And the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said that without a legally-binding guarantee that a hard border will not reemerge there will be no withdrawal agreement.In the light of this, interest has been aroused in a 201-page report published on Monday by a non-government organisation calling itself the Alternative Arrangements Commission.Backed by two former ministers, Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands, it has suggested that by 2022 a solution could be in place using a mix of technology, trusted trade schemes, mobile checks on food and animals within a new joint Irish-British Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) zone, special economic zones to push customs checks away from the border and a certain amount of looking the other way.The problems with it are legion. By imposing checks within a newly delineated border zone it fails the central task of avoiding new checks, and creates targets for terrorists in the new mobile veterinary vans. The burden of Brexit is put on Irish businesses. The exemptions on checks for many crossing the border will set off alarm bells for those concerned about the integrity of the single market.But the central problem for Brussels is that the plan is theoretical.There remains no certainty at all that the complicated IT systems, democratic consultation on the creation of new economic zones or negotiations with the European commission on the finer detail would be finalised by the end of the transition period of “standstill” relations.The Irish backstop would then have to remain to guarantee the avoidance of a hard border. The Brexit logic remains unyielding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ef73a1de06a0dea1f64e47f5c37e59b8fd54b1d/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=421bed5b0fea9aff31cfdc2268f3deec","title":"irish border kept open within three years after no deal brexit says report","story":"Report on keeping border open, backed by Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands, suggests special economic zonesAlternative arrangements for keeping the Irish border open in the event of a no-deal Brexit or the collapse of future trade talks with the EU could be up and running within three years, a report concludes.The interim report by a non-government organisation calling itself the Alternative Arrangements Commission will be unveiled at a special conference on the Irish border in London on Monday.Their conclusions suggest that the UK would only need the Irish border backstop contained in the withdrawal agreement until 2022, if work on such arrangements started today.Backed by remain-voting Conservative party MPs Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands, the report makes eight interim recommendations following consultation with business, politicians and economic experts, including commercial interests in Northern Ireland.It suggests special economic zones “covering frontier traffic and national security offer potentially valuable solutions” which it said would respect the realities of the border.The report addresses key issues including the vexed question of health checks on any live animals, animal or plant produce crossing the border, including milk, pigs and sheep.The report says “sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS)” tests could be carried out by mobile units away from the border.This would require politicians in the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) to accept checks on farms and in food-production plants and related facilities, something they have opposed so far.Among the other recommendations are the creation of a multi-tier trusted trader programme for large and small companies, with exemptions for small companies.This was proposed by the government in August 2017 and dismissed by the EU.One of the major challenges for the EU and the UK in keeping the border invisible is the issue of standards on food and food processing currently governed by EU regulations.Under mandatory EU rules checks have to be done at the border at special inspection posts with facilities for lab testing and refrigeration to guard against cross-border infection on everything from salmonella to mad cow disease.In a ‘no deal’ scenario, the UK would leave the single market and the customs union immediately with no ‘orce’ arrangement in place. The European Court of Justice would cease to have jurisdiction over the UK, and the country would also leave various other institutions including Euratom and Europol. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment. There would be no transition period. Free movement of people into the UK from the EU27 would stop.Trade between the UK and the EU would be governed by basic WTO rules. The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports - making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO ‘most favoured nation’ rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods - they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some ‘No Deal’ supporters have claimed that the UK can use Article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to ten years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke Article 24 unilaterally - the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.Until some agreements are in place, a ‘no deal’ scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses - for example the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a ‘managed’ no deal envisage that a range of smaller sector-by-sector bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Morgan and Hands say in the foreword to the report that the interim recommendations reflect the commission’s commitment to find solutions “compatible with any of the potential Brexit outcomes” including the current withdrawal agreement.The report found that any alternative arrangements must recognise “the supremacy of the BelfastGood Friday Agreement” (GFA) and the preservation of the common travel area.They should also recognise the need for a trade policy in the UK that is independent of the EU, and the need to ensure east-west trade flows as easily as possible.The report also states that all future proposals “must be based on consent”, one of the central tenets of the GFA and a recognition of the two heritages in Northern Ireland. Common all-island regimes should continue and where possible “built upon”.Special arrangements such as special economic zones and common SPS regimes could “potentially  not only the island of Ireland” but also Britain with a common rule book, like the Australia-New Zealand Food Safety Area.The report suggests such an arrangement would allow Ireland to break the EU’s common rule book if the UK erged from EU standards and regulations. This would, for instance, apply if the UK decided to do a trade deal with the US enabling chlorinated chicken to enter the country.This, it notes, would need checks in harbours, ports and airports in Northern Ireland to protect the entire island of Ireland, but this should be a decision for the Northern Ireland assembly.This scenario is predicated on Ireland having a side deal with the EU for a common rule book on the two countries and suggests Ireland would have the unilateral power to deviate from this, even though the EU is based on a system of rules that apply to all member states and not just one.Last October the DUP rejected any checks at ports or airports in Northern Ireland, arguing it would cut the region off from the rest of the UK, while the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, struck a similar position saying the government would “never ever allow a border down the Irish Sea”.And last week the government finally released a mapping exercise which showed the extent to which the border issue impacted non-trade issues with 142 issues including healthcare for heart patients.The commission was set up by Prosperity UK, an organisation created in 2017 that describes itself as an independent platform bringing together business, academics and policymakers to look constructively at the UK’s future outside the EU. It said it welcomed the opportunity for feedback so it could “refine” its recommendations.Northern Ireland Retail Consortium director, Aodhán Connolly aid economic freezones would create borders within borders.He expressed scepticism about how the alternative arrangements could comply with the December 2017 joint commitment between the EU and the UK to avoid “a hard border, including any infrastructure or related checks and controls”.“The solutions proffered add complexity and costs that will make business in NI less competitive and in some cases unviable. But with all that said this is a step forward and it provides some much needed informed debate on the issue,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa6da716f32d31c3c6a4211920806859317e54d8/1783_1153_1346_807/master/1346.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1507e6cae2ab8990120959c562a0f9c","title":"labour to launch review of citys progress on emissions","story":"John McDonnell says review will focus on firms’ readiness to cut emissions and opportunities for greener investmentLabour is to examine the readiness of City firms to cut carbon emissions and invest responsibly to tackle the climate emergency, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said on Monday.A review into City practices and how investments can be directed to promote technologies that cut carbon emissions will report by October as part of the party’s support for policies tied to the green industrial revolution.Speaking to City executives in central London, McDonnell said he also wanted the Bank of England to help monitor the City’s progress towards lower carbon emissions. This new responsibility would be on top of Labour’s plan to make the central bank also adopt policies that will boost the productivity of British firms.He said: “I am setting up a review group to overview the financial system as it currently relates to the climate emergency, in terms of both where and how it is causing or exacerbating the problem of climate change and where and how it could be providing solutions to problems.”Labour has already set out wide-ranging plans for a network of regional banks and an enhanced post office network to promote investment.McDonnell said these institutions would be given the dual role of increasing the level of investment in green technologies and making a profit.He said the review of the City will cover commercial banks, investment banks, pension funds, hedge funds, private equity and asset managers to cover areas of City that often escape scrutiny.Labour has put together a panel to review how the government and Bank of England’s new responsibilities can be implemented.“The UK is and will remain a hub for finance,” he said. “That gives us all the more responsibility to make sure that the lending that takes place here aids the tackling of the climate crisis rather than fuelling it.”Labour plans to offer a mix of stiffer regulation and tax incentives to promote “large scale beneficial investment” to support the growth of the economy.“But we will also fulfil our responsibility to ensure adequate policing of investments using the mechanisms available to us to require companies to live up to their climate change responsibilities,” McDonnell said.Responding to questions about Labour’s stance on Brexit, McDonnell said he would prefer to campaign to remain inside the European Union in a referendum or general election despite representing a constituency that voted to leave the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f30c5a5d6a89bef8e2a1bec5483d99acc0abb11/0_92_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6d03de3a86f8b280f4b436665a6cb8d","title":"all female mars colony possible using frozen sperm says study","story":"Scientists find frozen sperm exposed to zero-g could go where no man has gone beforeAll-female astronaut crews could reproduce in space without the help of accompanying men, new research suggests.The study found that frozen samples of sperm exposed to microgravity retained similar characteristics to sperm samples kept on the ground, raising hopes that a sperm bank could one day be set up in space to help populate new worlds.This could prove interesting for female astronauts, amid reports that future missions to Mars may involve women-only space crews.Helen Sharman, the first British astronaut, said at a conference in 2017 that there had been an unreleased Nasa report exploring sexual desires of space crew members during potential missions to Mars. Sharman said the report had recommended space crews of the same gender – “all men or all women” – because they have better team cohesion.Findings from the small preliminary study, involving sperm from 10 healthy donors, suggest that “the possibility of creating a human sperm bank outside of Earth” exists, according to the researchers.The study was presented on Sunday at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology annual meeting in Vienna, Austria.Montserrat Boada, from Dexeus Women’s Health in Barcelona, who presented the research along with her colleagues, said: “Some studies suggest a significant decrease in the motility of a human, fresh sperm sample. But nothing has been reported on the possible effects of gravitational differences on frozen human gametes, in which state they could be transported from Earth to space.”One group of sperm samples used in the study had been exposed to microgravity with the help of a small aerobatic aircraft. The samples then underwent fertility screenings and were analysed for concentration, motility and DNA fragmentation.No significant differences were detected between samples that had been given a ride and those that had stayed on the ground.The researchers said that further work was needed to fully understand the effect of space conditions, such as different levels of gravity, and that sperm would have to be exposed to space-like conditions for longer periods of time.“Our best option will be to perform the experiment using real spaceflight but access is very limited,” Boada said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4e303285161fad0c3d4a7c3e924e751667741b/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=021fb721b2212a5b5aea6275acb0e8aa","title":"tell us has your camhs record affected future employment","story":"As part of an investigation into the issues people who have completed treatment face we would like to hear your experiences Hundreds of thousands of young people pass through the UK’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) each year.

After taking the big step of asking for help, people can face a wait of a year or more before receiving formal therapy.

Hamilton won at Paul Ricard from pole, untroubled after the first corner for his sixth victory this season. He leads the world championship by 36 points from his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas and after an uninspiring race to watch, was at pains to point out that the poor spectacle was not down to the drivers but rather the regulations.He attended a meeting in Paris last week where F1 management, the teams and the FIA considered new rules set for 2021. Previously drivers have not been involved in the process and having seen it in action Hamilton did not believe the system was fit for purpose.“From how it’s set up, just from watching when I was there, it’s not good. Really not good,” he said. “They won’t like me saying that.”His central complaint is one that has dogged the sport for some time: that teams should not be involved in shaping F1’s future.“Ultimately the FIA are the governing body and they need to make all the decisions,” he said. “The teams shouldn’t be involved in that because the teams all want to do something for themselves. That’s natural, they’re competitive. Same in football, if all the teams sat in a room and said the sport should be like this, they would push and pull for their own benefit.“But if you get a central group of people telling us, like the FIA for example, that their sole job is to make the sport great again, hiring iniduals or whatever, then they should have the power. They should make the decisions.”Hamilton attended the meeting after discussions within the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association, and with its president, Alex Wurz. He said there was a consensus that F1 needed to change and that drivers should be involved in the process.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels“I really enjoy driving, my work ethic, my team, I continue to love that,” he said. “But I empathise with fans watching and thinking ‘ugh’ about a race like Sunday. I race my heart out but it might not be so exciting to watch, I empathise with that so I committed to going to the meeting.”Hamilton has five world championships and has been in F1 since 2007. He is 34 and may race for several more years but insisted he wanted to ensure he left the sport in good health when he retired.“If I look at my legacy, I’d love to be able to look back and say I was a part of helping that positive change for the fans that are watching F1,” he said. “That would be a cool thing to be a part of, not just as a driver and the titles but someone who actually cared about the sport.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02b3b24b5f9ef71c8ea8f48b77774206369bdf5e/0_139_2928_1757/master/2928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1300be68fdd19a361c878ed9def36495","title":"bangladesh v afghanistan cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"Anyhow, thanks all for your company and comments - John Ashdown will be here presently to coax you through the chase. In the meantime, here’s something to read. Afghanistan bowled pretty well but let themselves down with their fielding, and probably lack the firepower to chase a decent total on a difficult pitch and slow outfield. If they’re going to get it, they probably need to go early, because once the fielders are back and the rate’s up, they’re in trouble. Which looks like 30 too many to me, but what do I know. A slower ball yorker, from the back of the hand, foxes Mosaddek, who’s too slow on it, but what an innings that is - it might just have decided the game, pushing a competitive total just out of reach. 50th over: Bangladesh 262-6 (Mosaddek 35, Shaifuddin 2) Gulbadin brings himself back to finish off and Mossadek trusts his partner, excavating a yorker for a single. And, well, dearie me, Saifuddin edges a slower one, two men converge on a dolly, and Dawlat spills it. Afghanistan’s fielding has been miserable today and they’re punished for this error because a single brings Mossadek back on strike and he immediately clouts four. Two singles follow. 49th over: Bangladesh 254-6 (Mosaddek 28, Shaifuddin 0) Mossadek takes a single off the final ball of the over to retain strike he’ll be planning an onslaught, though I daresay his team think they’ve enough already. Mushfiqur swings the bat at one, gets underneath part of it, and Nabi catches easily at cover. That’s a brilliant innings, and on this pitch worth at least another 30. 49th over: Bangladesh 251-5 (Mushfiqur 83, Mosaddek 26) Mossadek is enjoying himself, cleansing an ugly full toss through cover, where Nabi es over it like Bobby Mimms. 48th over: Bangladesh 246-5 (Mushfiqur 83, Mosaddek 21) Nice from Mushfiqur, who manufactures a reverse-sweep that flies just past the flying Hashmatullah at short third man. Then, after a single, Mossadek hits with the spin to earn four by way of cover - that’s a lovely shot. Rashid, though, comes back well, conceding just one more - Mossadek curses himself for missing out, but it’s not at all easy out there. Rashid finishes with 0-52, and has probably hit that point of his career where batsmen know what to expect so he needs to better at his variations, rather than find more of them. 47th over: Bangladesh 236-5 (Mushfiqur 78, Mosaddek 16) Zadran, who’s not had such a good day, returns Mosaddek smacks his first ball to the fence at long on. Zadran retorts with a yorker but follows that with a wide, after which Mosaddek clumps down the ground Nabi does really well to skip over from long on and save the boundary. Two dots follow, then a one, and Bangladesh look like they’re going to post something eminently chaseable. 46th over: Bangladesh 227-5 (Mushfiqur 77, Mosaddek 9) Bangladesh have mustered 27 from the last five overs they’ll be wanting more from these next five, and this one yields seven, without a boundary. That reflects well on the bowlers despite the outfield and track, and badly on the batsmen despite the outfield and track. “Elbow’s Neat Little Rows has a (lengthy) vocal refrain of ‘Ya da, ya da, ya da, ya da’, says David Clifford. “Every time I hear it I just hear ‘Yadav, Yadav, Yadav, Yadav.”Incidentally, “Yadav” means “his hands” in Hebrew, which is nice for a bowler, just as “emess”, as in MS Dhoni means “ultimate truth”. 45th over: Bangladesh 220-5 (Mushfiqur 75, Mosaddek 4) Gulbadin wants this done so brings back Mujeeb not bad naches for an 18-year-old. But he’s taken for three twos and a one, leaving him with figures of 3-39 from his 10. That’s an excellent job of work. 44th over: Bangladesh 212-5 (Mushfiqur 68, Mosaddek 3) On comes Rashid to target the new man, who gets off the mark with a three to fine third man. Mushfiqur takes a single either side, and he must be wondering if, as the senior batsman, he should be pushing the pace or making sure he stays in. Then, Rashid hits Mosaddek on the pad and asks the umpire if it was too high the umpire tells him there’s a way to find out, and he knows what that is. 43rd over: Bangladesh 207-5 (Mushfiqur 64, Mosaddek 0) ““Another one involving Shikhar Dhawan,” says Stephen Cottrell. “Feeling Holy by the Charlatans has a lone ‘shake it down, shake it down shake it down into which I always transpose the flamboyant Indian opener. Also, I quite like Ramesh Powar’s name in the Yeah Yeah Yeah song by the Flaming Lips.”The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song has got to be one of the worst song titles of all-time. Gulbadin sends down not so much a slower ball as a slowest ball and Mamudallah is through the shot almost before it’s arrived, slapping to mid on where Nabi takes an easy catch. This has been a pretty nifty innings, given the injury. 42nd over: Bangladesh 203-4 (Mushfiqur 64, Mahmudullah 25) Nabi sends down three dots before Mahmudullah whacks to cover, where Gulbadin removes his hands from harm’s way they run two instead of one, raising the fifty partnership. A single follows, and I’m surprised Bangladesh aren’t going because they’ve wickets in hand. 41st over: Bangladesh 200-4 (Mushfiqur 64, Mahmudullah 22) Gulbadin returns and Mahmudullah is into him right away, coming forward then somehow fashioning a square drive to the fence! That is an absolute jazzer! A single and a two follow and I daresay both sides will be ok with where we are, which tells us we could be in for a thriller. “In India,” begins Abhijato Sensarma, “‘Disco Dancer is a movie from the previous century which became an instant cult classic owing to its display of a dancer trying to live the big life. It’s one of those movies from the past which will not win the award for the best movie in any year, but it’s also one of those movies which you’re always down to see on a free evening. I provide the link below to one of the songs from this enduring film. After hearing it, I can only hope that despite being released in the 20th century, the song must have been written with another player not playing today kept in mind - Mr Anderson!”40th over: Bangladesh 193-4 (Mushfiqur 62, Mahmudullah 17) Nabi returns and after a single to each batsman, Maumudullah eases back and crunches over the infield for four to cover. That was a lovely shot, and Bangladesh need more of them if Afghanistan can limit them to, say, another 60, they’ll fanxct they’ve got a chance. “Ba Ba Ba, Babar Azam,” croons Alex Crofts. “Heard this one from a worse for wear England fan at Headingly when Pakistan were in the field a couple of years ago. Now it’s on a loop in my head whenever I watch him...”39th over: Bangladesh 186-4 (Mushfiqur 61, Mahmudullah 11) Mahmudullah is putting himself through it, taking one to cover then two to midwicket Shinwari shies wildly, not for the first time today, and yerman forces himself through for an overthrow. One more follows, then Mushfiqur slaps four to fine leg. 38th over: Bangladesh 177-4 (Mushfiqur 54, Mahmudullah 9) Mujeeb returns and, with three wickets so far, earns himself a slip. Four singles and a wide from the over and yerman is furious with the last of those which tells you how confident he’s feeling. “There are a few instances of eight off a single ball via Law 19.8,” emails Dave Loren. “John Wright was a beneficiary in the early eighties when he’d run four and Rod Marsh took an ill-advised shy at the stumps and instead sent it to the rope.”37th over: Bangladesh 172-4 (Mushfiqur 52, Mahmudullah 7) Mushfiqur’s had enough, picking down the track to monster Dawlat over long on for six - that’s his fifty. Three singles follow, making this Bangladesh’s best over in quite some time. “There are ODI rankings why not make use of them?” wonders Uma Venkatraman. “Top eight qualify for the world cup everyone plays each other twice top two play the final. It’s not the length of the tournament that will bring spectators in, it’s the quality of the matches.”Because it’s important to grow the game. The biggest event needs to be inclusive, and the plan is to have high-quality matches between everyone, eventually. 36th over: Bangladesh 163-4 (Mushfiqur 44, Mahmudullah 6) Rashid continues, and he’s been much better in his second spell than his first. Mahmudullah picks out point for one, Mushfiqur adds one more, then Mahmudullah totally misjudges its final delivery, which grips and bounces, then misses the edge. On the one hand, that’s good for Afghanistan on the other, they’ve got to bat in a bit. There’ve been only four boundaries in the innings, and perhaps that’s how to go about the chase: chuck the bat during the powerplay. “I remember in the famous 1982-83 Ashes Test in Melbourne,” says Rocket, “late on the fourth day when England were trying to get Allan Border off strike and bowl to Jeff Thomson - Border hit the last ball of an over hard towards the western square boundary (where we were sitting) and the batsmen were running three. David Gower was running alongside the ball, hoping it would go into the boundary. From memory I think it just did, but we thought he was about to help it on it’s way. We knew that rule, and Australia would have got seven runs rather than four. Which, all things being equal, would have resulted in a tie the next morning!”35th over: Bangladesh 161-4 (Mushfiqur 43, Mahmudullah 5) A single begins the over and brings Mahmudullah onto strike. He nudges into the covers and looks to run, but Mushfiqur isn’t giving his wicket away for a man on one leg he sends him back, the throw misses the stumps, and they indulge a languorous overthrow. One more single follows, and it’s now 11 overs since Bangladesh hit a boundary while they’ve not hit a six all innings. “He’s not playing today, or for a while,” says Rob Hogg, “but I have found find myself singing Shikhar Dhawan’s name along with the chaps in this.” Any more for any more? 34th over: Bangladesh 157-4 (Mushfiqur 41, Mahmudullah 3) That break probably served Bangladesh more than Afghanistan who, for the first time, will feel in the ascendancy. The batsmen take a single each, then Ma Ma Ma Ma Mahmuduallah Mahmuduallah flicks to midwicket and nobbles a hammy before he can turn for the second no he doesn’t. He looks to half a calf strain, because it’s that part of his body being bandaged. Mushfiqur then forces him into another single - you’ve got to laugh. “Loving schmice!, frask! and zetz!” emails Peter Salmon. “Obviously what we need is Batman retooled as Jewish, and sock!, biff! and bap! etc. replaced. Nah nah nah, Fledermoyz Man!”Batman with added existential dread he’d be great at a party. 33rd over: Bangladesh 153-4 (Mushfiqur 39, Mahmudullah 1) Afghanistan are bang in this now - Soumya out the road before the closing slog is very helpful, and one more wicket will open up one end. Two from Gulbadin’s latest over, and if his team can keep it tight for the next bit, they’ll force the batsmen to force the issue. In the meantime, it’s drinks. “’Zetz’ is a great word that I’ve never come across before, says Matt Dony. “Now, I’m a lover, not a fighter, so I don’t tend to throw too many punches, but I’d definitely like to start using the word. Am I allowed? Or is that cultural appropriation?”Chutzpah, schmooze, klutz and such tell me that you’re fine. And worry not: I’ve never zetzed anyone in my life, but I still find plenty of contexts to enjoy the word, for example: “Yanky definitely did not get sufficiently zetzed on Friday night such that he somehow took a chunk out of his own lip”.32nd over: Bangladesh 151-4 (Mushfiqur 38, Mahmudullah 0) Anyone else sing Mahmudullah to this? No, there’s on bat involved, but what’s this? It the breaking past leg? No! umpire’s call, and Soumya is gone. “Asking, asking, getting!” exclaims Mark Nicholas. Soumya is trapped by a full one, but is there bat involved? It’s very close...31st over: Bangladesh 148-3 (Mushfiqur 35, Soumya 3) Gulbadin sends down three dots before Soumya goes for a Red Bull single to mid off and doesn’t bother grounding his bat at the other end a direct hit makes him wonder, but we go upstairs and he’s fine. Mushfiqur then drives to cover for one more and Soumya chases a wide one to guide two to third man. “You’re watching this on your keyboard?” asks Geoff Wignall. “How novel. Re the format how about this simple arrangement:three groups of five, top two from each group plus two best third place teams into the quarter finals? (With some fiendishly complicated tie-break arrangement for third placed teams if needed, understood only by three people at the ICC - or simply let them play each other.)3 7 games in total (without any tie-break) if quarter finals a knockout or 39 if they’re round robin. India get to progress as far as their performance merits, which I realise might be too controversial a notion.”Yes yes, very funny. My keyboard packed up, at which point I experienced intense emotion, which distracted me from the cricket on my screen. You’ll be relieved to know that I am now equanimous once more. 30th over: Bangladesh 143-3 (Mushfiqur 33, Soumya 0) Afghanistan are still in this because every time they’ve needed a wicket they’ve got one but more than that, they’ve got the right one. Meanwhile, Damien Burns gets in touch to resolve our legal issue: “Law 19.8 in the MCC Laws of Cricket states that:‘If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder the runs scored shall be(i) any runs for penalties awarded to either side AND(ii) the allowance for the boundary AND(iii) the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act. Law 18.12(b) (Batsman returning to wicket he has left) shall apply as from the instant of the throw or act.’ So the single that the batsman took is awarded as well as the boundary, thereby adding 5 runs to the batting team, and the bastman would retain strike.”So it literally is not cricket. Mujeed gives this one a real tweak, ripping fingers down the back of the ball, and it spins off a length, past the inside edge and raps the pad bang in front. And even in dismissal, Shakib shows his brilliance, eschewing the review because he knows he’s out, even though he’s also him. 29th over: Bangladesh 142-2 (Shakib 51, Mushfiqur 32) Afghanistan have slowed the scoring a little, but badly need to break this partnership. Mushfiqur edges a single - he’s getting full use of his bat here - and two more singles follow. G.L. Sherwood is back in touch to wonder what “shmice” means, and this is one we can be sure I did not make up it is yiddish for hit hard, and is usually administered to a child by a paren one sporting team to another a tin to a person. Other similar terms: “frask”, which is usually a slap or a swipe, and “zetz”, which is usually a punch.28th over: Bangladesh 139-2 (Shakib 50, Mushfiqur 30) Mushfiqur plays three dots then caresses a single into the covers. This brings Shakib onto strike and he edges to backward square, easing through to raise his fifth fifty of the competition. Brilliant. “Modern trends have caused cricket to come off as a batsman’s game,” reckons OB Jato, “but at heart, I’ve always felt that it’s more of a bowler’s game in fair conditions. Many of the matches in this World Cup so far as well as most of the 2018 Test season has proved this notion of bowlers coming out on top more often than not in duels against batters. As Azhar Mahmood said during an interview recently: “It takes 300 balls to get 480 runs, but it takes only 10 balls to get all 10 wickets.”I’d say that it’s a batsman’s game in that the laws are biased towards batsmen and the bat is usually on top, but it’s a bowler’s game in that great bowlers are less common. In limited overs, I don’t think it matters much if what constitutes good bowling is conceding 60 not 80, or taking two key wickets, not none, but in Tests we need to be more careful. 27th over: Bangladesh 136-2 (Shakib 49, Mushfiqur 28) Gulbadin sends down a much-needed maiden to Shakib –I think that’s the first of the inning – and I am certain that Shakib isn’t bothered. 26th over: Bangladesh 136-2 (Shakib 49, Mushfiqur 28) Aaargh! Nabi returns and absolutely rinses Mushfiqur with an off break that drifts, grips and turns the batsman edges, the keeper can’t gather what would’ve been a reaction belter, and they run two. My keyboard then packs up so I miss what comes next, but the scoreboard tells me it’s two singles. 25th over: Bangladesh 132-2 (Shakib 48, Mushfiqur 25) Gulbadin returns and Shakib edges his first delivery for two - there’s no slip in place. As Metternich once said, I wonder what he meant by that. Eight off the over, the fifty partnership raised, and this is beginning to look like a match-settler. “Regarding the format issue,” says Kennedy Ross,“Requirements:1. We want more teams2. We want more excitment, less predictability3. Indians need to be going on to at least semis to keep BCCI happy.The solution would be to let India enter two separate teams, solving all three problems in one move.”Tangentially, I wonder what it’d take to get Virat Kohli involved when he retires. The combination of gravitas, edge and love would be extremely helpful.24th over: Bangladesh 124-2 (Shakib 41, Mushfiqur 24) On comes Rahmat Shah, who gets away with one first up, short and wide Shakib cuts hard, but straight to the sweeper at deep point and they run one. What I love about Shakib is most things, but what I’m especially loving about Shakib right now is his equanimity. He misses out, he doesn’t miss out, he lets it go and moves on, the kind of thing that’s contagious. Anyhow, Rahmat cedes two more singles, then Mushfiqur takes a giant stride, stays low, and sweeps an excocet to the point fence. 23rd over: Bangladesh 117-2 (Shakib 39, Mushfiqur 19) Afghanistan are back in need a wicket territory and after Dawlat cedes four from his first three balls, he beats Mushfiqur outside off. Of course, karma takes its revenge, Mushfiqur swinging at the next one and top-edging four over the keeper’s head. Two more follow to third man, and this is getting away from Afghhanistan now - that’s 10 off the over. “When Carlos Brathwaite was doing his best to drag West Indies over the line against New Zealand,” emails Adithya, “it struck me that if Brathwaite took a single off the last ball of the over to retain strike, the New Zealand fielder could throw the ball over the boundary in order to make it a four and get the No. 11 batsman on strike.This tactic only has application in a very particular kind of situation. 20-30 runs to defend against an explosive batsman who might knock it off with boundaries and a tailender whose wicket will give you the game. Have you ever seen or heard of any teams resorting to this?”I’ve not, but I like it very much indeed. The problem is the risk, I guess - you’d look pretty silly if it failed - and, of course, though the laws permit it, assuming the laws permit it, it probably “isn’t cricket”. 22nd over: Bangladesh 107-2 (Shakib 36, Mushfiqur 12) This is such clever batting, keeping the scoreboard ticking without taking risks. Sounds simple, isn’t simple.21st over: Bangladesh 103-2 (Shakib 35, Mushfiqur 9) This is such a key innings from Shakib. Obviously his team need the runs, but there’s more to it than that - it’s essence of captaincy. Even in cricket, where the job is about more than shouting and cajoling, in the end, its key aspect is leading from the front, especially at crucial times. This, there can be no doubt, is that. He takes two from the first ball of the over, nurdled to mid off, then adds a single to fine leg. Mushfiqur then edges one more, a wide follows, then another single into the leg side and that’s eight from what seemed like quiet over. 20th over: Bangladesh 95-2 (Shakib 31, Mushfiqur 6) Rashid continues and is milked I wonder if, in years to come, he’ll see this competition as an important staging-post in his development, or just hate playing in England. Six off the over. “As refreshing as it is to see English supporters politely clap after every boundary or wicket,” says Abhijato Sensarma, “I’ve always liked the spirit of subcontinental supporters more.Seeing the pure passion of the Afghan fans pleases me to no end. It could well be the sole reason I tune into every match they are at. Even today, they seem to be perennially happy to be here.This contingent is a synecdoche for the sense of pride, nationalism and inspiration sport is meant to encourage. No matter what happens on the pitch today, no admirer of cricket can resist giving their best of luck to Afghanistan and its fans going forward. Here’s to hoping each one of us is as happy and passionate as them about something in our lives, be it our career, our partner, or the thing all souls turn to some time or the other - sport at its glorious best.”I’m not sure you’ve correctly characterised an English crowd. It’s like that at Lord’s, but not anywhere else, and even there, we can wonder if the politeness is sincere. But in general I agree, rowdiness and abandon are beauties of sport, provided they’re natural and refrain from cringe. 19th over: Bangladesh 89-2 (Shakib 29, Mushfiqur 2) Dawlat returns and cedes just a single from his first four deliveries, then tries a bouncer that’s also wide, so is called wide. Shakib then opens the face and guides his next ball wide of slip Asghar does really well to catch up with it and save the boundary as the batsmen run two then have a drink. “We’re puzzled by the verb ‘to squanty”’, tweets G.L. Sherwood. “A cursory internet search throws up just one other use, in 2017, by a certain, hang on, er, Daniel Harris. Are you messing with us or what?”Would I ever? I’d love to claim the neologism, but the truth is that those who use it are not really into internets. When you squanty something - you usually squanty it down - you sort it out. It can often relate to a slightly dodgy activity, though it needn’t. 18th over: Bangladesh 85-2 (Shakib 27, Mushfiqur 1) Suddenly it’s all going off! Bangladesh are still pretty well-set, but if Afghanistan can find another, everything changes. Or is it! Shakib goes upstairs, and might he just be ok on height? YES HE IS! NOT OUT!Rashid bowls on a length, deceives Shakib with some extra bounce and raps him on the knee-roll! Up goes the fingers, and it’s two in two! 17th over: Bangladesh 82-1 (Tamim 36, Shakib 26) “While I’m all for countering the pervasive influence of theYes, I could live with that. What we need is jeopardy, more teams to grow the game, and enough scope for classics at the business end.What comeback from Nabi, who bowls full and Tamim comes forward when he should go back, plays for more turn than there is, and the clatter tells him what’s up. My word Afghanistan needed that! 17th over: Bangladesh 82-1 (Tamim 36, Shakib 31) Nabi continues and the batsmen take single apiece, then two dots before Tamim absolutely cleanses a short one to the fence at midwicket. 16th over: Bangladesh 76-1 (Tamim 31, Shakib 25) Rashid Khan into the attack, and his team need something from him - he’s only got four wickets in this tournament, and that’s not really enough given his status. The batsmen have a look at him and Tamim takes a two into the leg side. 15th over: Bangladesh 74-1 (Tamim 30, Shakib 24) This is really impressive from Bangladesh, who have this track squantied right down they’re keeping the scoreboard ticking without taking risks, then meting out treatment to the balls which demand it. This over yields only one, to Shakib, but the platform is set. 14th over: Bangladesh 73-1 (Tamim 30, Shakib 23) Tamim loses patience and twinkles down the track as Gulbadin releases to shmice him down the ground for four. Four singles follow, then Shakib attacks a short one that sits up and begs to be hit he obliges with a pull to the midwicket fence and is now tournament’s leading run-scorer. He and his team are getting away. Incidentally, I have now received about 57 different suggestions for how to structure this thing of ours, which tells you how hard it is. Shall we just have a fight instead? Or perhaps a quiz on Engoish cricket from the mid-80s to the mid-90s.

We’ve shared all this information with the select committee and Westminster and elsewhere. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.Clegg did not address allegations that Facebook’s viral mechanics aid populist politics at the expense of more moderate campaigns, a theory cited by academics and researchers to explain the rise of populism. But earlier this month, he dismissed those concerns as well, telling the Times’s Red Box podcast that populism was “not new”.He added: “Social media has something which is qualitatively new, which is scale and speed. What is not new is people coming up with bonkers ideas, or fake ideas, or indulging in extremist or populist points of view. That was not invented 15 years ago. Populism, extremism, conflict and ision in society, particularly when you have, as we have had since 2008, profound economic and social shocks to society, I think people some times confuse symptom with cause.Clegg also argued the recent backlash against technology companies created “the risk that we throw the baby out with the bathwater and make it almost impossible for tech to innovate properly … Technology is not good or bad. Technology down the ages is used by good and bad people for good and bad ends.”Before he took the job at Facebook, but after the Brexit and US presidential votes, Clegg wrote in the Evening Standard that he found “the messianic Californian new-worldy-touchy-feely culture of Facebook a little grating”. However, even then, he argued “populists know how to appeal to emotions in a way reasonable, measured liberals almost never do. So the politics of moderation needs to pack a bigger emotional punch. That’s our problem – not Mark Zuckerberg’s.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ff90c4d238ca4b97ed9bd66bcf06d6b62ededf3/548_352_1448_869/master/1448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a6ddaaefa63418f4161621bb927e87c","title":"mike pompeo us saudi arabia talks iran united arab emirates tensions","story":"Trump official seeks to isolate Iran as Washington plans further sanctionsThe US is to propose an international maritime Gulf protection force, its special envoy on Iran has said, as the Trump administration prepared to announce fresh economic sanctions on Tehran.Brian Hook said he had been holding extensive talks with US allies in the wake of the Gulf of Oman tanker attacks, when two vessels were damaged by explosions. He believed a global coalition to protect shipping was required.“There have been too many attacks. We could have had an environmental disaster and extensive loss of life due to reckless Iranian provocations,” he said.Hook said the G20 summit this week in Japan would be a good forum for discussions. As many as 17 countries had been adversely effected by the recent tanker attacks either directly or through crew, insurance or contracts, he said, and an international force might isolate Iran diplomatically as well as make it more perilous for Tehran or its surrogates to mount further attacks.Iran has denied responsibility for the blasts.Hook, seen as one of the hawks on Iran inside the US administration, said Tehran faced a choice: “They can either start coming to the negotiating table or they can watch their economy continue to crumble.”Tensions with Iran have been mounting since Donald Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal last year and began applying pressure on Tehran through economic sanctions.On Monday the US president said other countries, including China and Japan, should protect their own oil tankers in the Middle East. “Why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries …for zero compensation,” he wrote on Twitter. “All of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been a dangerous journey.”The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, met Saudi Arabia’s king and crown prince for talks on Monday as the US sought to promote an anti-Iran alliance.“You are a dear friend,” King Salman told Pompeo, who was due to fly to the United Arab Emirates later on Monday for further discussions.Before his departure from the US, Pompeo had said Saudi Arabia and the UAE were “great allies in the challenge that Iran presents”.He also reiterated Donald Trump’s offer of dialogue to improve relations with Iran. “We’re prepared to negotiate with no preconditions. They know precisely how to find us,” Pompeo said.Last week, the US pulled back from the brink of a military confrontation with Iran after Trump called off strikes ordered in retaliation for the shooting down of a US drone.Iran has said it will not enter into discussions until sanctions are lifted. The fresh round of US sanctions is however an attempt to force the Iranian leadership to hold talks with the US. A near-total ban on oil exports is already in place.On Sunday, the hawkish US national security adviser, John Bolton, said Tehran should not “mistake US prudence and discretion for weakness”.A drone strike on an airport in Saudi Arabia by Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels, which left one person dead and 21 injured, will have coloured the mood among Gulf states. It follows another attack on 12 June.Hook is also to meet officials from Britain, France and Germany this week, but declined to say what pressure he will putting on those countries to follow the US out of the nuclear deal with Iran if, as Tehran has threatened, it breaches its permitted uranium enrichment stock levels on Thursday.The EU has the choice of either putting the issue in the nuclear deal dispute mechanism, or threatening its own retaliatory measures.The British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said the UK was focused on de-escalating the dispute and refused to comment directly on claims that London had not been consulted before Trump sanctioned and then cancelled the planned strike on Iran last Thursday. Hunt said the UK had the closest possible intelligence relationship with the US.Germany appeared cool towards US talk of building a global coalition against Iran. A foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday that Berlin had “taken note via the media” of Pompeo’s comments and added that “our top aim is and remains a de-escalation of the serious situation”.Hook claimed the EU was being subjected to nuclear blackmail by Iran, and claimed Iran had rejected the opportunity to take various diplomatic “off-ramps” in the past year.The UK, together with France and Germany, is urging Tehran to wait for European countries to set up the much-delayed financial mechanism designed to help businesses in Europe trade with Iran, circumventing secondary US sanctions. Iran saw an increase in trade as one of the key benefits of the deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c06fd8a44c0dada2b98d397a4075b4c1a5be555/0_187_3134_1881/master/3134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=585c0574292c4531cf51337b12290445","title":"erdogan faces scrutiny once more as istanbul goes back to the polls","story":"Voters embrace CHP party campaign bridging religious, class and ethnic idesTurkey’s opposition has won a high-stakes rerun of the Istanbul mayoral election, a serious blow to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and a landmark victory in a country where many feared democracy was failing.Shortly after initial results pointing to a landslide win for the opposition coalition candidate, Ekrem İmamoğlu, emerged on Sunday evening, the candidate of the ruling Justice and Development party (AKP), Binali Yıldırım, conceded and congratulated his rival.The repeat election, designed to undo İmamoğlu’s narrow surprise win in the 31 March contest, was an unprecedented test for both Turkey’s fragile democratic institutions and Erdoğan’s political future.Yıldırım’s swift concession saved the AKP the embarrassment of watching the vote count add up to a second defeat, but the loss is likely to lead to intense new power struggles inside the coalition government. Opposition parties were jubilant.“We are starting a new page in Istanbul. On this new page, there will be justice, equality, love. Today 16 million Istanbullus have refreshed our belief in democracy,” İmamoğlu told supporters in a televised speech.“I thank them all from my heart. You have shown the world that Turkey still protects its democracy. And we have shown other countries who try to go down the road we were choosing that it is no road at all.”Crowded parties broke out on Istanbul’s main shopping streets and in liberal neighbourhoods.“This has brought people hope,” said Semra Deniz, 35, from the city’s artistic hub, Cihangir. “I came to this neighbourhood six years ago and a lot has changed. Places closed down. I hope the cultural erosion is reversed and people feel free to express themselves again.”Despite blanket pro-government media coverage, İmamoğlu, a previously anonymous local administrator, stunned the country with his narrow win in March. For Erdoğan, the loss of his hometown, where his political career began in the 1990s, was a personal blow.After weeks of AKP appeals, Turkey’s electoral board upheld one complaint regarding ballot counting and annulled İmamoğlu’s victory, sparking outrage even within the ruling party’s ranks, where some feared the board had dented the AKP’s democratic credentials.At polling stations on Sunday both CHP and AKP voters stressed that they wanted the repeat election accepted as final.“Clearly there is some funny business going on here but I don’t know what,” said AKP voter Cihat Içyumaz, 65, who like many Istanbullus cut short his summer holiday to vote. “For me, chaos after this round of elections is the scariest outcome. I just want the candidate who is best for Istanbul to win.”Yıldırım worked hard in the second round of campaigning to close the gap with his rival, reaching out to the party’s base in working class and conservative neighbourhoods, voters who punished the government for Turkey’s economic crisis by staying away in March.However, in both a televised debate with İmamoğlu and in conversations with voters, Yıldırım struggled to explain why the repeat election was necessary.İmamoğlu was embraced by voters for a platform which focused on bringing people together across the city’s religious, class and ethnic ides, and was able to paint his new campaign as a battle for the future of Turkish democracy itself.“Erdoğan has to do some serious house-cleaning in his government and reassess his policy making process to bounce back from this, or the suggestion that this is the beginning of his decline will get louder.”Rumours are already circulating that the second defeat could trigger a snap national election as Erdoğan seeks to oust increasingly fractious elements in his governing coalition.Observers note that İmamoğlu’s mandate is still far from assured: the 2015 general election which saw the AKP lose its majority in parliament was rerun and other charismatic challengers to Erdoğan have been imprisoned or folded under pressure.The AKP still controls 25 of Istanbul’s 39 districts and holds a majority in the municipal assembly, which will make it difficult for İmamoğlu to deliver on campaign promises. The margin of his victory, however, shows that at least in Istanbul there is a strong appetite for change after 16 years of national AKP rule.“People say it takes a long time to build a democracy, but today’s result shows it takes a long time to kill a democracy too. Clearly, Turkey’s democratic structures are incredibly resilient.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f766442971ff0ead57dff4c995aebc03a13e9929/0_270_5710_3426/master/5710.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb042bcf201b418a29fc6b64f370633a","title":"chinese wedding photos a picture essay","story":"Pre-wedding photo sessions have become big business in China, as couples demand lavish mementoes of their big day in advance. Gone are the days when couples would be satisfied with a single black and white photo to commemorate their weddingChinese couples used to be satisfied with a single black and white photograph taken on their wedding as a memento of their special day. But times have changed dramatically, and the wedding photographs, especially pre-wedding photo sessions, have become big business in China.In the main touristic spots in different cities across China, it is easy to see couples having their pre-wedding photoshoots, which become the must-have for every Chinese couple before their marriage. Unlike western weddings, where couples usually have their photos taken on their wedding day, for Chinese people it is quite popular to have their day-long photo sessions way before their actual weddings. Sometimes it can be half a year or even a year in advance of the ceremony.Some couples even choose other countries for their pre-wedding sessions. Often for their photoshoots couples go for traditionally romantic cities such as Paris.Those who can’t afford such a trip to have pre-wedding photos with the Eiffel Tower can have their photo taken in front of Chinese replicas of the main world’s tourist sites.Other couples prefer more traditional outdoor locations, like Beijing’s Hutong neighbourhood, or to be surrounded by nature like in Dali, where lots of couples do their pre-wedding photography next to Lake Erhai.These sessions can range in price from a few hundred up to thousands of dollars, with companies providing clients with everything from outfits to makeup and transportation. Brides typically have at least three dress changes per shoot. Inspired by the traditional western style, many choose a flowing white wedding dress, a Chinese-style red gown, and something more modern.The shoots are just one part of a booming industry in China. A wedding for most newly married couples can run from 50,000 yuan (£5,700) to 200,000 yuan, with larger amounts not uncommon in big cities like Beijing or Shanghai. China’s wedding industry was valued at 1.46tn yuan in 2017, and it is expected to grow to 3tn yuan by 2021."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f47d7503ee3227e035714b04abcee3b61ece0870/99_293_3401_2040/master/3401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=282369bb2b2ce5f41918489a6657574b","title":"french call for referendum macron airports sell off","story":"President accused of ‘flogging family silver’, as communists and Sarkozy MPs join forcesEmmanuel Macron’s plan for the biggest wave of French privatisations in a decade is under threat after opposition politicians took the unusual step of joining ranks to push for a referendum on the sale of Paris airports.The centrist French president wants to sell the state’s controlling stake in Aéroports de Paris, the profitable operator of Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, which are used by more than 100 million passengers each year. It would be among the biggest privatisation operations in French history, alongside Macron’s plans to sell other stakes in the national lottery as well as the gas and power group ENGIE.The privatisation on the Paris airports is a crucial part of Macron’s modernisation plans for the French economy. A source close to the president said the state was not best qualified to run airport shopping and, with Charles de Gaulle ranked low for passenger experience, private managers could improve that. Profit from the sale – expected to be more than €7bn (£5.5bn) – would be redirected into a new investment fund for startup companies and technology, and would also help plug the national debt.But political opponents accuse Macron of “flogging the family silver” and letting go of strategic state infrastructure. They say the UK, with its privatised Heathrow airport and privatised railways, illustrates a potential nightmare scenario of key transport infrastructure run for profit.“It would be the first time the people would be able to decide on such a massive issue of privatisation,” said Laurent Russier, the communist mayor of Saint-Denis, north of Paris. At a time when gilets jaunes (yellow vests) anti-government protesters have called for more of a say in politics, and Macron has promised to listen more to citizens, a potential referendum is a test for French politics.A race is now under way to gather the 4.7m signatures. “It will be extremely difficult but not entirely impossible,” said one campaigner, urging French voters from all regions and living abroad to sign. At least 17,000 signatures would be needed per day, but the government online platform for people to sign up is seen as difficult to use and prone to crashing. More than 200,000 people are estimated to have signed up since 13 June.This week, the first public meeting to garner support was held in a crowded trade union building in Saint-Denis. In the French capital’s northern suburbs, Charles de Gaulle airport is a key employer. There were unusual scenes, with communist-voting trade unionists waving flags and applauding rightwingers whom they once would have jeered.“The public interest comes first,” said Eric Coquerel of the hard-left party La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), arguing that it was not an anti-Macron political game, but a drive to protect state infrastructure. Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally was not invited to join the group, but she has urged her supporters to sign up to reach the 4.7m target.On the right, politicians said Macron was using the same arguments as the Thatcher government over Heathrow’s privatisation in the 1980s – that there would be “better services provided for airline passengers”. Gilles Carrez, a rightwing lawmaker, said: “Many major airports have stayed under state control. The obvious exception is Heathrow and today the British regret the privatisation of Heathrow.”“Pollution,” shouted a woman in the crowd, concerned over airport expansion like Heathrow’s third runway. The historian Patrick Weil said: “We’re in a third world war against the climate crisis, a battle which should be mobilising all of humanity. Selling Aéroports de Paris to the private sector is like handing arms to our enemy.”The recent months of gilets jaunes demonstrations have highlighted privatisation in France – particularly the private companies which run French motorways. Last autumn, gilets jaunes protesters blockaded scores of motorway toll booths around the country, expressing anger at the rise in toll prices since privatisation in 2005.Not everyone agrees. Gérard Lacher, a member of Les Républicains and head of the Senate, said the referendum drive amounted to a hijacking of democracy.Among those who have already signed the petition for a referendum, Michel (surname withheld), 80, said: “A referendum is a good thing because I don’t trust politicians. The people should decide.”Danielle (surname withheld) said: “Selling off Paris airports is one privatisation too far. We’ll end up looking like Britain in a Ken Loach film. An airport is not just about selling macarons or perfume – it’s security and the environment.”Claire (surnamed withheld) had worked in baggage-sorting at Charles de Gaulle for 25 years. She said: “We need to keep it human. It’s not a profit machine.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3930872.1560956010!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ryanair has nothing further to add airline refunds hard to come by","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDue to weather conditions, the Ryanair flight landed at Dublin Airport instead of Shannon.  Photograph: ReutersPaul HannaFile PhotoWe don’t often have cause to revisit stories that we feature on this page but, for reasons that will no doubt become apparent, we feel compelled to do just that this week. It has to do with Ryanair and it is disturbing on a couple of levels.On Friday, April 26th, a reader by the name of Adrian Gordon and his wife took a flight from Malaga airport to Shannon Airport. Due to weather conditions, passengers were advised by the pilot as their plane began to land that they were landing at Dublin Airport instead of Shannon.All passengers were told to go to the Ryanair desk at the airport so transport to Shannon could be arranged.The plane duly landed at Dublin Airport shortly after midnight and, as instructed, Adrian went to the Ryanair desk where he was told that because a lot of flights had to be erted from both Shannon and Cork Airports there were no more buses available.He was told to hire a car or get a taxi to Shannon and that Ryanair would refund him the cost within seven days.As it happened, Adrian did not have his driving licence with him so he and his wife had no option but to hire a taxi from Dublin to Shannon Airport at a cost of €440.80. When he got home he sent a claim to the airline.However, despite the promise made by crew on the ground in Dublin, the airline refused to refund the cost of the taxi and instead it insisted “that surface transportation was arranged by them for all passengers”.So Adrian contacted us on May 3rd and we immediately contacted Ryanair after which we received a distinctly terse statement which said simply: “We’ve resolved this directly with the customer.”Now we could have left it there but we decided to check with “the customer” and we got in touch with Adrian again.He told us that he had indeed received a call from a representative of the airline and had been told that a refund would be with him in a matter of days. Happy days, we thought.But no. Weeks past and no refund came.Same flight, other complaintsIn the meantime other complaints about the same flight started coming in to the Pricewatch desk.Barth’s wife “queried as to whether that meant we should organise our own taxi or car rental and the Ryanair representative said yes. To ensure that there was no misunderstanding, my wife again queried as to whether it was definitely acceptable to organise alternative transport to our original destination and queried as to how we would be refunded for same. The Ryanair representative clarified that this was acceptable and that an application for a refund for same could be made through the Ryanair website.”So the couple hired a car. They even gave another group a lift to Shannon – an act which would have saved the airline the expense. But then when Barth went to claim the money from the airline, he received a mail which said: “Operations Department has confirmed that surface transportation was organised for all customers to their original destination and as such we are not liable for any alternative transportation costs you may have incurred.”Then there was Colm McEnery. He had no choice but to hire a car at a cost of €301.60. Like Barth, he gave a group of other passengers on the plane a lift to Shannon – saving Ryanair money. But his claim was also refused by RyanairPeter McCarthy was on the same flight as was Claire Sloan and Diana Fahey. Like all the others they were told by Ryanair that “Our Operations Department has confirmed that surface transportation was organised for all customers to their original destination and as such we are not liable for any alternative transportation costs you may have incurred.”Untrue statementThis claim, which had been made repeatedly by Ryanair when affected passengers tried to claim back expenses incurred, was clearly untrue.Now, back to Adrian Gordon, the first person to contact us.As you will recall, when we contacted Ryanair in early May we were told that it had “resolved this directly with the customer”.But that was not actually true either. Over the weeks that followed, in spite of the claim by the airline, the refund Adrian was told was on the way never materialised – he contacted us several times with updates.So at the end of the month we got back on to Ryanair and asked why it had not honoured the commitment it had made to Adrian.While we were at it we also sent details of the other passengers’ complaints to the airline. And once again the airline said, “We’ve resolved this directly with the customers.”This was a line we were growing used to hearing. So we kept at it and then on June 11th – almost six weeks after the airline had claimed to have resolved the issue with Adrian and after we had interceded twice on his behalf – he got in touch to say he had finally got his refund.We have also followed up with the other passengers and they too have been refunded.But all of this raises an important point. Every one of these passengers were told at the airport they could hire a car or get a taxi from Dublin to Shannon because there was no buses available. Yet all of them were told subsequently by the airline that its “Operations Department has confirmed that surface transportation was organised for all customers to their original destination and as such we are not liable for any alternative transportation costs you may have incurred.”That claim made by Ryanair in its rejection letter was clearly not true.So last week we got back on to the airline and asked why its email correspondence with these passengers made a claim that was clearly untrue. We also asked if there were other cases of it responding to its passengers looking for expenses incurred or money back with similarly untrue claims.We received the following statement: “This flight from Malaga to Shannon (26 April) erted to Dublin due to unfavourable weather conditions at Shannon Airport. Ground transportation was organised from Dublin to Shannon but not all customers were accommodated on the bus transfers. We have been in contact with these customers directly.”Keen eyed readers will notice that this response did not really address the questions we had put to the airline so we tried again. We asked why the initial correspondence had contained a claim that was untrue and asked if it was aware of other instances when its correspondence had misled passengers looking for money they were entitled to back.“Ryanair has nothing further to add,” was all that came back in response."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3935165.1561324245!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gynaecologist performed exploratory work without consent","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tObstetrician and gynaecologist Prof Ray O’Sullivan says he did not feel he needed to obtain consent before carrying out tests on five women patients last year. Photograph: Anthony DevlinPAA report into the failure of a senior hospital consultant at St Luke’s Hospital, Kilkenny, to obtain consent before carrying out gynaecological “exploratory work” on women patients is under consideration by Ireland East Hospital Group.Obstetrician and gynaecologist Prof Ray O’Sullivan says he did not feel he needed to obtain consent before carrying out tests on five women patients last year. The hospital maintains he should have obtained consent, has sought his suspension and has reported the matter to the Medical Council. The tests were stopped last September after nursing staff raised concerns over whether the required consents had been obtained from a regional hospital ethical committee and from the patients themselves.The tests, which were carried out by junior staff unaware there was an issue with consent, involved flushing the vaginas of the women with water, inserting a miniature scope for monitoring, and measuring the pressure within the vagina. The equipment involved, including tubes and pressure gauges, was brought in from outside the hospital.Investigation of symptomsThe women involved had been referred to the hospital for investigation of their symptoms.Speaking to The , Prof O’Sullivan said the issue “had more to do with preliminary, exploratory work – as to whether you need consent for that before you engage in an actual clinical trial. It was more technical than anything else.”Asked if he felt he needed consent, he replied: “I felt I didn’t need consent. I didn’t because we weren’t actually doing the research. We were just seeing if a particular procedure that we were planning on doing as part of the research could be done.”Tests stoppedOnce the issue became know, the hospital stopped the tests and informed the patients, who were told investigations into the matter would be completed within weeks.The hospital commissioned a report from Prof Peter Doran, a scientist at UCD’s school of medicine, which was critical of the failure to secure consent.Ireland East Hospital Group then commissioned a second report. Prof O’Sullivan said he was sure that report would say “that’s fine, fire ahead with the research but just get the ethical approval going forward for the actual research”.A spokeswoman for the hospital group said its chief executive Mary Day had “only received the report on Friday and hasn’t had a chance to review it”.Asked whether an apology would be made to the women affected, she replied she had “nothing further to say”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"High Court heard young man had been at \u0026lsquodeath\u0026rsquos door\u0026rsquo before undergoing treatmentPatrick Nevin attacked three women in the eleven days after meeting on dating appNew climate legislation, budgets and targets will ensure greater oversightArchbishop of Dublin says priest\u0026rsquos invitation to visit Ireland in October should be withdrawnFather-of-one shot by person on a bicycle while pushing his four-month old baby in a buggyHeavy rain hit country on Sunday and Monday but better weather is aheadConcerns at overcrowding with daily average of 3,911 inmates noted by Irish Prison ServiceT\u0026aacutenaiste expects next CAP to place huge emphasis on sustainability and greenhouse gas reductionsCLP\u0026rsquos Norman Spicer said State redress scheme could help avoid prolonged litigationAnthony Moynihan was sentenced in his absence to seven years for rape of 11-year-old boyAttendees at international cycling conference Velo-City say political courage is neededDeath of Manus Kelly, FF councillor and business man, described as \u0026lsquoan immeasurable loss\u0026rsquoDublin City Council has put forward a plan for a \u0026euro10m traffic-free College Green plazaCentral Bank sends letter notifying that unauthorised selling would be criminal offenceObstetrician and gynaecologist\u0026rsquos work on new speculum raises bodily autonomy issuesKilkenny hospital referred matter to Medical Council and sought suspension of doctorForged email to Barnier purports to show DUP leader\u0026rsquos support for EU\u0026rsquos Brexit position"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3934928.1561299339!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"college green traffic ban for three summer sundays to test plaza plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA architect’s image of the proposed College Green plaza.College Green in Dublin city centre will be traffic-free for three days this summer, the business representative group Dublin Chamber has confirmed.In a tweet it said College Green, the area in front of the Bank of Ireland, would be pedestrianised on Sunday July 21st, Sunday July 28th and Sunday August 4th.The aim is to test the popularity of a car-free plaza at College Green. A programme of family events are planned on these days to encourage people into the city centre.The council is expected to reapply for permission for the plaza in the coming months.The board last November rejected the pedestrian and cycle plaza scheme due to concerns about the “significantly negative impacts” it would have on bus transport and traffic in the city.ApplicationThe council intends to lodge a fresh application to the board by the middle of this year. However, its head of traffic management Brendan O’Brien said it was unlikely the plaza proposals would change.“An Bord Pleanála themselves in their judgment, and in the inspectors report, found the plaza was a good idea. Architecturally there were no real issues with it,” he said. “The issues were the knock-on consequences of the plaza rather than anything to do with the plaza itself.”In its ruling last November the board said “the principle of the proposed development is acceptable” and that it would produce a “quality public realm” and would “facilitate improved appreciation of the architectural and cultural heritage of this important site”.However, it would not give permission because of the traffic implications for the city, particularly on buses.The board said there was “uncertainty” about the potential effects on the bus system, but they were likely to be “significantly negative in the light of the scale of rerouting of buses proposed, the critical importance of bus transport to the city, and its future role in facilitating modal shift from public car usage, in line with national policy”.It criticised the traffic analysis done by the council and was not satisfied it was “sufficient to accurately quantify the traffic impacts of the proposed development and the magnitude of those impacts”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3935690.1561374724!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sunshine on the way in ireland with temperatures to reach 27 degrees","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA stroll in the sunshine at Sandymount, Dublin.

If it was an Islamic state, I wouldn\u0027t have left.The main reasons I left the so-called Islamic State is because they started to kill people I know them personally that are Muslims.I had a group of about 20 friends that all left the so-called Islamic State. They all left at one time. One by one, they started to kill them.Jack Letts in Raqqa, SyriaLetts said that he was caught as he tried to escape the border into Turkey after expecting safe passage through Al Nusra-Front territory.He said: They would help us leave. They would get us a smuggler. Nusra Front not great guys, but they\u0027re a lot more trustworthy than the Free Syrian Army.Letts\u0027 commented on his mental heath, claiming that he was diagnosed with Tourette\u0027s and severe obsessive compulsive disorder.The convert left his middle-class home in Oxford to become one of IS\u0027 most notorious recruits before his eventual capture.Now, after languishing in prison for two years, Letts said that he regretted becoming the poster boy for Islamic extremism.He said: That\u0027s one of the things that I regret I realised that me coming had a lot more meaning than a Syrian becoming ISIS.Jack Letts in Kurdish jailSpeaking about his time in solitary confinement, he said: You wouldn\u0027t be able to sit with me like this. You\u0027d say I\u0027m insane.  Letts faces being barred from returning to the UK under rules that allow Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, to strip him of his citizenship provided it would not make him stateless.   I\u0027ve repented from what I did, and it\u0027s not important in a sort of legal sense, but that\u0027s why I left. I realized what I did was wrong, religiously and also in a moral sense, he added.There\u0027s a feeling of stress and there\u0027s a feeling of regret.

Wangige is hardly Helmand, nor, by his own admission, did counterinsurgency work particularly well in either Afghanistan or Iraq.Ex-major Wayne Hennessy-Barrett, 46, served in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo and Iraq before founding 4G in 2013 in KenyaYet the traditional “microfinance” model of lending to the poor was not working either, Mr Hennessy-Barrett reckoned. Once a buzzword in development circles, microfinance has been hailed by its proponents as a powerful tool in fighting poverty. Tony Blair and Bill Clinton were both fans.The idea was simple enough. Many poor people in the developing world eke out a living as petty traders, but rarely have access to the credit needed to grow their businesses.Microfinance was meant to give them that access through  small loans and low-cost banking services, setting them on the path to self-sufficiency. The model has gone global in recent decades: more than 200m people round the world have been the recipients of “microcredit”.The miracle has largely failed to happen, however. While disagreements about the impact of microfinance abound, studies have suggested that the model has largely failed to lift the poor out of poverty. Many, indeed, have been left worse off because they have been plunged into debt.Mr Hennessy-Barrett reckons the problem largely lies with the model used by most microfinanciers. To keep overheads down, many companies lend through mobile phone apps and have little interaction with their clients or knowledge of what the money is going to be spent on.Wayne Hennessy-Barrett at a market in WangigeOften cash is borrowed to cover unexpected crises, such as funerals and medical operations. Reflecting a growing problem in Kenya, loans to cover online gambling are also increasing, according to government officials.Lacking a sufficient or regular enough income to pay back the loans, many default. More than one million people have been blacklisted by the country’s two main credit ratings, sometimes over loans of less than £5.Credit alone, Mr Hennessy-Barrett realised, was likely to do more harm than good. Only if people borrowed sensibly, and understood how to turn loans into larger incomes, would they have a chance of escaping poverty rather than being sucked deeper into it.“Just shoving money at people is not enough,” he said. “Having a loan to solve a problem is not enough. What you need is a livelihood where you can use credit for leverage. When it it just to live it is a recipe for poverty.“Cheap debt pushed carelessly at poor people keeps poor people poor.”Valentine Nasila, Operations Manager at 4G Capital\u0026#39s head office, speaks with a clientThere was no question in his mind that microcredit was still the key to fighting poverty. In a country where formal jobs are few and far between, three in four working Kenyans are self-employed, scratching a living by selling goods to other poor people.Yet if poor borrowers were to have a chance of success, he concluded, they would need much more face-to-face support from trained professionals who understood the needs and challenges of their clients.It was in attempting to meet this need that Mr Hennessy-Barrett drew on his army experience. In Afghanistan, the British army’s counterinsurgency operations were designed to deny insurgents ground by protecting communities, creating the conditions to let them live normal lives and speaking to people to understand their needs and reassure them.Such skills could also be deployed in peacetime environments, he felt. From the time of its foundation in a small office in Wangige in 2013, his company, 4G Capital, would run along army lines.Wayne Hennessy-Barrett\u0026#39s business is one of Africa’s fastest growing financial technology companies“In Afghanistan we had several teams of elite soldiers operating in multiple places, communing with the population, trying to understand their needs,” he said.“That led to a methodology of having small teams of well-trained, dedicated professionals.”From the outset, Mr Hennessy-Barrett deployed his staff in teams of four and sent them to trawl through the markets using his own interpretation of the army’s “patrol trinity”.In counterinsurgency terms, this meant “intelligence gathering”, “framework protection” and “local assurance”. For 4G, this was reinterpreted as “marketing”, “lending” and “growth and repayment”. Teams would seek to understand the environment they were operating in, lend to iniduals after learning what their needs were and finally helping them to grow their businesses so they could repay their loans.The loans on offer were small, between £40 and £400, and had to be repaid within a month, the intention being to enforce discipline and focus money where it was needed: replenishing inventory, adding stock and growing businesses.Crucially, it also came with basic training, teaching clients how to maximise growth potential, keep books and improve customer care. The mixture of personal attention and computer algorithms to assess the viability of clients’ growth potential means that 92 percent of loans are paid on time, meaning the company has more money to lend.The model appears to have been phenomenally successful. From its original outlet in Wangige, 4G Capital now has 70 more, with more than 300 employees. Expanding into Rwanda and Uganda, it is one of Africa’s fastest growing financial technology companies. It expects to lend £47 million over the next 12 months.Optometrist Tabitha Njeri, 26, borrowed £80 from 4G Capital to start her own optician\u0026#39s storeThe success, Mr Hennessy-Barrett says, has come from “slaving” the company’s fortunes to the fortunes of its clients. It is doing well because its clients have seen their businesses grow on average by 82 per cent since taking their first loan from 4G.Tabitha Njeri, who runs a small optician’s shop in Wangige, is one such beneficiary. 4G lent her £80 towards her startup costs early last year, gave her training in accountancy and business growth skills and rolled over loans to allow her to increase stock from 50 to 150 glasses. She now plans to expand by opening a diagnosis lab.“I used to find it very difficult to raise enough to support my family,” she said. “Now I can. I have financial stability.”Down the road, Patrick Ngore, who runs a chemist’s, says he has been able to increase stock sevenfold with loans from the company. He also credits training in stock management and minimising expenditure in growing his profit margins from 20 to 40 per cent.Others in Wangige tell similar stories.In many ways, the 4G model, although partially reliant on technology,  is a return to the basics of microfinance. Loans have allowed Patrick Ngore, owner of a chemists,to increase his stock sevenfold and boost his profit margin from 20 per cent to 40 per centThe founder of modern microfinance is generally held to be Mohammed Yunus, who started making small loans to the very poor in Bangladesh in 1976. Lending mostly to women, who formed small groups that were collectively responsible for each other’s debts, he found that astonishingly few defaulted.His Grameen Bank has now made more than £7 billion pounds in small loans to the poor, an achievement that secured him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.Yet the microfinance model he pioneered would grow increasingly troubled. Irresponsible and often predatory lending to the poor led to debt crises in Bosnia, Morocco and parts of Pakistan. It also contributed to a debtors’ revolt in Nicaragua in 2008 when farmers, backed by President Daniel Ortega, refused en masse to pay back microcredit loans. A microfinance default crisis in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh two years later was blamed for a surge in suicide by farmers.Geoffrey Kamanu runs through a finance training programme with staff from 4G Capital The longstanding problem with microfinance, which is largely driven by private companies like 4G, is that business logic often leads to aggressive tactics in collecting debts, says David Roodman, author of the book Due Diligence: An Impertinent Inquiry into Microfinance.In countries like Kenya many microfinance outfits lend at interest rates as high as 30 per cent because they are forced to raise capital from commercial banks, often placing an intolerable burden on poor borrowers.Mr Hennessy-Barrett says his model is addressing those concerns: interest rates are capped at 13.5 per cent and allowances are made for “bad-luck customers” who encounter unexpected setbacks like illness or a death in the family.Experts in Kenya generally applaud 4G Capital’s model, which has been mimicked by one or two other outfits. But they also raise questions about what impact it can really have.Microcredit | Transforming fortunes and futures in NepalDespite its growth, 4G and its 120,000 customers are still pretty small fry, says Paul Musoke, director of financial institutions at FSD Africa, a UK-funded organisation that looks at ways to financially empower the poor.By contrast, M-Shwari and Tala, two providers of small loans through mobile phone apps, have 11 million between them in Kenya alone. Such “light-touch” models, which use technology rather than people to engage with borrowers are always likely to do better than “heavy-touch” approaches like Mr Hennessy-Barrett’s — except in densely populated countries like Bangladesh.“It makes sense what he is trying to do,” says Mr Musoke. “The question is whether it can be scaled up significantly to make an impact.”The other danger in Kenya is that a microfinance “debt bubble” risks being created because, in a poorly regulated market, there is little to stop poor borrowers from taking loans from 4G and other companies offering unsecured credit at the same time.Microfinancing: revolutionising the health and livelihoods of Nepalese women“The greatest potential for harm has come when you have multiple lenders all growing at once because then almost certainly people are borrowing from one to pay the other,” says Mr Roodman.Mr Hennessy-Barrett’s model seems enlightened, yet it is too soon to tell how effective it will be. History suggests that microcredit often stimulates start-up businesses, but ultimately fails to enrich its owners, becoming more a tool helping to manage poverty than to reduce it. Mr Roodman likens it to a prescription drug “useful in moderation but dangerous in large doses”.While it may not be a panacea, microfinance has given people more choice, whatever the overall risks. If Mr Hennessy-Barrett can tweak a flawed model and encourage others to follow suit, he could yet prove as successful pioneer as Mohammed Yunus.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Banks and FinanceTravellers demand £1,500 to leave rugby club grounds, a similar price of the court order to evict themBoris Johnson allies suggest Carrie Symonds could be behind \u0026#39staged\u0026#39 picturesTory leadership latest: Ken Clarke says he would be prepared to bring down his own government to block no-dealComment: Turkey\u0026#39s strongman President is still capable of causing plenty of problems for the WestIconic Ferrari 250 GTO recognised as work of art in bid to protect world\u0026#39s most valuable classic car Comment: For how much longer can we ignore the genocide happening on our doorstep?Comment: Such a protracted and unseemly brawl would not have happened under the old leadership rulesCan the Irish border \u0026#39trilemma\u0026#39 be solved?

Researchers will monitor the participants’ heart rhythms and any injuries caused by armour rubbing on their forearms or legs to gain exact data on what the 16th-century French heroes had to endure.France is set to experience a major heatwave Stéphane Gal, a historian at Grenoble-Alpes university who is one of the expedition’s leaders, said: This is what we call ‘experimental archaeology\u0027. We’re going out on the terrain, beyond words and iconographic documents.” In keeping with 16th century technology, the armour has been fashioned by hammering, without welding. The group will follow the route taken by King Francis’s scouts, which is slightly different to that followed by his army.The horsemen’s armour, swords and equipment weigh some 66 pounds, while the foot-solders’ kit weighs more than 30 pounds.“It took several months of training for our bodies to become accustomed to bearing this metal exoskeleton,” Mr Gal said.The extraordinary multi-million-pound project is being sponsored by Cameron O’Reilly, an Irish-Australian businessman, the Grenoble-Alpes university, the Isère department in south-eastern France and the National Centre for Scientific Research. The participants are braced for extreme physical discomfort. In a letter to his mother in August 1515, Francis I complained: “It is exceedingly tiresome to wear armour in these mountains.” Nevertheless, the sovereign ordered his men not to remove their armour because he feared that the Swiss might ambush them.Those repeating the experience will bivouac outdoors overnight, around a camp fire. Their rations will be identical to those of their 16th century predecessors: a chunk of bread with goat’s cheese and dried meat.Comment: Turkey\u0026#39s strongman President is still capable of causing plenty of problems for the WestTory leadership latest: Ken Clarke says he would be prepared to bring down his own government to block no-dealCould British army counterinsurgency techniques help reduce poverty in Africa?Iconic Ferrari 250 GTO recognised as work of art in bid to protect world\u0026#39s most valuable classic car Comment: For how much longer can we ignore the genocide happening on our doorstep?Comment: Such a protracted and unseemly brawl would not have happened under the old leadership rulesCan the Irish border \u0026#39trilemma\u0026#39 be solved?

For this reason, weapons of mass destruction and personal weapons in general should not be sanctified.”Mr Tutunov admitted that this conclusion contravenes current practice and had to be rewritten after heated debate within the commission. The document must still be discussed by top church officials before it becomes doctrine. In recent years, Russian Orthodox priests have often been seen chanting prayers and casting holy water on arms like S-400 surface-to-air missiles in Crimea and intercontinental and short-range ballistic missiles taking part in the victory day parade on Red Square.They have also blessed assault rifles, fighter jets and nuclear submarines.In the 1990s, priests were even reputed to bless gangsters\u0027 pistols.The issue has arguably become more pressing as the church attaches increasing numbers of priests to military units. A school for chaplains is being built at the defence ministry\u0027s Patriot Park outside Moscow. Father Mikhail Vasilyev blesses soldiers in front of a mobile church that can be deployed to the fieldChurch doctrine holds that war is evil but can be necessary to “protect loved ones and restore justice”.Priests were known to have blessed swords before the victory over the Golden Horder at Kulikovo and tanks during the Second World War.Mr Tutunov said the church had to “make sense of the new realities” of modern weaponry, however. The practice of blessing rockets bound for space will apparently continue.After a Proton-M rocket carrying Russian navigation satellites broke up during launch from Baikonur cosmodrome in 2013, local priest Sergei Bychkov claimed that “the ones that crashed were the ones we didn\u0027t bless”. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

He was a lifelong “better off outer”, they said, who tempered his views during the referendum but then prevented Labour from opposing Brexit – thus ceding ground and millions of votes to the Liberal Democrats, Greens and nationalists. This is probably too simple. It seems more likely that Corbyn was always most interested in gaining power, but had a different view of the right way to go about it. Immediately after the referendum, for example, most Labour people thought it was right to accept the result and to press for a soft Brexit. And in the 2017 election, Labour’s policy of a “jobs-first Brexit”, combined with opposition to a no-deal exit, was no obstacle to a stunning electoral performance that deprived Theresa May of her majority.It was only last year – when The Independent started to campaign for a Final Say referendum – that Corbyn’s attempt to straddle Leave and Remain started to cause strains in the party. Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Steph Houghton celebrates with teammates after scoring England\u0027s first goal during the Women\u0027s World Cup round of 16 match against Cameroon at the Stade du Hainaut stadium in Valenciennes, FrancePride marchers at a rally outside the Scottish Parliament in EdinburghThe sun rises between the stones and over crowds at Stonehenge where people gather to celebrate the dawn of the longest day in the UK.

Labour did badly in the European elections, and yet managed to hold Peterborough in the by-election against a strong Brexit Party challenge. The New Statesman reports that one analysis prepared for the shadow cabinet suggested that Labour is losing votes in a 2:1:1 ratio to the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the Brexit Party. In other words, for every one it loses to the Brexit Party, it loses three to the Remain parties. This suggests that Labour should take up a more explicitly Remain position – which is what Corbyn is now cautiously doing, although his Remainer critics will say it is too little, too late, and still allows the Lib Dems and the Greens to outflank the party on the pro-EU side. But Corbyn’s Leaver critics – the 26 MPs who signed a letter to him today opposing a new referendum – say that he risks the worst of both worlds: losing Leave voters on one side while failing to win Remain voters back on the other. This split is represented at the top of the party, with Ian Lavery, the party chair, posting an angry tweet this morning – which was presumably meant to be a private message – saying that the position of the shadow cabinet supporters of a referendum “really is to head for revoking Article 50”. On the other side, Emily Thornberry’s public support for a referendum exceeded the bounds of party policy, prompting Corbyn to demote her from her role deputising for him in the Commons (sending her to “re-education camp”, as the prime minister put it). She continued to press her case at the shadow cabinet meeting today. What is interesting is that Keir Starmer, assumed to be the leading organiser of Labour’s shift of position, has been less outspoken. Yet he has been drafting and redrafting the words of the policy as it has gradually evolved. The most important force behind the shift has been the views of party members. They are overwhelmingly in favour of a referendum, and of staying in the EU. They were fended off with a complicated policy at the party’s annual conference last year – the compromise once again drafted by Starmer. And the pressure from many of the trade unions – not including Unite, led by Corbyn’s ally Len McCluskey – has added to the feeling that the line could not be held.  In the end, the decisive voice will probably be that of John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. He has consistently struck a tone more favourable to a second referendum than Corbyn’s, and he spoke at today’s shadow cabinet to say that opposition from members to the existing policy had become so great that it was time to change the party’s position. Despite briefing from the party’s spokespeople that Corbyn’s words to the shadow cabinet do not represent a change in policy, it seems there is no doubt that a policy shift is now under way.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Conservatives have paid lip service by saying they have zero tolerance to Islamophobia and anti-Muslim prejudice, but this new poll confirms they face a real crisis.”Created with Sketch.Brexit racism and the fightback Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Demonstrators protest against an increase in post-ref racism at London\u0027s March for Europe in July 2016These cards were found near a school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, the day after the EU referendumA worker at this Romanian food shop was asleep upstairs at the time of this arson attack in Norwich on July 8, but escaped unharmed.

They feel Hunt is the ideal opponent.He voted Remain in , he has been in Cabinet throughout Theresa May’s premiership with its Brexit failures and he is a mild-mannered figure who struggles to impose himself on debates.One Boris backer jokes that they have never seen, “a more lop-sided two-horse race”.The Hunt campaign bristle at the idea that this is going to be a walkover.They believe he has a route to victory by playing on Tory members’ concerns about whether Boris can actually do the job of being PM.They also think they will do well with the large Scottish membership — Scots are twice as likely to be members of the Tory party than the English — and are planning an early campaign trip there.They expect to pick up the endorsement of Ruth Davidson, the popular leader of the Scottish Conservatives.But for all Jeremy Hunt’s efforts to make this a contest, it is still Boris Johnson’s to lose. Of course, he could. He could make a spectacular gaffe or some scandal could blow up.Last night’s revelations of the screaming match at the flat he shares with his new partner shows the scrutiny that his le is going to come under.If he can get through the next fortnight without any major blunders, he’ll become Tory leader.Why  Because the postal votes go out from July  and most Tory members willthem within two days.As one Tory veteran explains: “A week after the ballots have gone out, it is too late to change anything.”I understand Boris will use the next weeks to set out his Brexit position in more detail.Those hoping to see him in full entertainer mode at these hustings will be disappointed. Instead, he intends to stick to the serious persona of the past few weeks.One of those preparing him for the month tells me that Tory members “know he can do Boris. They need to see him do Prime Minister.”This new, more serious approach won’t stop the attacks.Boris’s critics have lost their judgement and want to attack him as a homophobe, despite the fact he was one of the first politicians to back gay marriage. Just as absurdly, they want to smear him as a racist.Oddly, these attacks actually create a problem for Jeremy Hunt.The more ridiculous the criticism Boris faces, the more Tory activists will rally to him. This will make it harder for Hunt to get a hearing for his far more measured criticisms of Boris.All of these hustings will be broadcast on the internet. I understand the Boris campaign were not best pleased about this, which suggests they still have some concerns about their candidate slipping up.But even in this age of political upsets, it is hard to believe that Boris Johnson won’t be the winner of this contest.EDDIE Lister is to run the transition team that will prepare Boris Johnson’s governing programme.Lister, chief of staff for Boris when he was Mayor of London, will take charge of this process and the working assumption is that having done this, he will move to No as chief of staffBoris becomes PM.Crucially, Boris knows and trusts Lister. In his successful stint at City Hall, Lister showed that he knew how to bring order to Boris world – which is no mean feat.One of those close to the decision tells me: “Boris has made the biggest shout, who is your number one man  It is Eddie.” The need for order is urgent.If Boris enters Downing Street, he’ll only have  days until October , the day by which he has promised Britain will be out of the EU. He won’t have any time to lose.Intriguingly, I understand that Sajid Javid – who was knocked out of the leadership race on Thursday – was interested in doing this role.But the Johnson camp wanted whoever ran the transition to become the Downing Street chief of staff. A key challenge for Lister will be to make sure there is a clear structure.Boris has always liked having multiple sources of advice.As one of those who has known him for years observes: “There are going to be lots of dferent courts, lots of people competing for the monarch’s ear – and he quite likes that.”But this source warns that, “as a recipe for government, it could be quite fractious”.It is Lister’s job to make sure there is a clear chain of command.I understand that the spoilt ballot papers weren’t covered in graffiti, but simply left blank.“THE problem is the ,” says one of those preparing Boris for government.The  is a reference to those Tory MPs who voted for Rory Stewart before his elimination from the leadership contest.If only a fraction of this group decides to try to bind Boris Johnson’s hands on Brexit, then the Government could collapse.One of Boris’s closest allies warns that, “It is going to be really problematic, there is going to be a Remainer counterweight to the ERG”, the group of hardline Brexiteer MPs.To the alarm of Boris’ allies, Rory Stewart is uninterested in serving in a Boris Cabinet. Instead, he is setting himself up as an alternative voice on the backbenches.Stewart and his supporters have to remember, though, that a Corbyn government would be worse for this country than any Brexit outcome.The problem for Boris Johnson is that his Brexit strategy relies on MPs giving him time to seehe can use the threat of No Deal to winkle a concession out of the EU.The only chance of these  MPs giving him this time isthey think it is a bluff.“They have to believe it is a bluff, the ERG have to believe it is for real,” con- cedes one Boris ally.Pulling this off is going to be a political high-wire act.BORIS Johnson and Michael Gove have spoken since Gove’s elimination.I’m told the conversation wasn’t substantive but wasn’t rancorous, despite the tactical voting by Johnson supporters that led to Gove being knocked out.In the next few weeks Gove will get on with departmental business. He’ll introduce “Natasha’s law” for clearer labelling of allergens in products, named after Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died after eating a Pret sandwich, and increased sentences for those who abuse animals.I am told that it is “not settled one way or the other” whether Prime Minister Boris would keep Gove at the Environment department or offer him a bigger job. But given the scale of the challenges facing theTories, it would be foolish to not put their most talented departmental minister in one of the great offices of state.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She said everyone knows such photos can be hi- jacked and used to threaten and embarrass.I am sure that Whoopi meant well but it all backfired when an emotional Bella posted a video saying how upset she was at being “shamed” by the presenter and actress, — calling her actions “sick and disgusting”.I find it utterly baffling that Bella was more distressed by the words of a middle-aged woman who had her best interests at heart than the saddo who tried to embarrass her by releasing nude photos on to the internet for all the world to see.It’s a great shame this has now escalated into a row between the two women, because I truly admire Bella for how she has handled the whole potential blackmailing situation.It was a masterstroke and instantly took all the power away from the snivelling little git who was hassling her. Bella was not ashamed or embarrassed by the intimate pictures and would not be held to ransom. Good for her.But surely it was far more upsetting to be the victim of a potential crime than receiving a slight scolding from Whoopi for being naive enough to take and keep those sorts of images in the first place.Bella had a right old rant on Instagram and has vowed never again to appear on The View — a chat show co-hosted by Whoopi which is the US version of our Loose Women.I feel very sorry for Bella because she was clearly extremely upset by what Whoopi had to say but I think her anger is misplaced.Whoopi was makIng a really important point, which affects everyone, not only those in the public eye.She was speaking for worried parents of teenagers and twentysomethings everywhere who are concerned that online photos of their children getting drunk, posing nude or even having sex will come back to haunt them.It is one of the real dangers of social media that our accounts are not really secure. they can be hacked with relative ease, falling out of “the cloud” and on to your boss’s Facebook — or, even worse, getting viewed by your mum and dad.There are people who think it is a jolly wheeze to post explicit photographs of former lovers online, or who do it as “revenge” for being dumped.Of course, there are those who have no common sense and post pictures of themselves romping in hotel rooms with girlfriends or boyfriends or boozily feeling each other up on holiday.The authorities are now cracking down. Last August, a man who hacked into hundreds of iCloud accounts of Hollywood actresses and leaked their nude pictures was sentenced to eight months in prison.George Garofano stole private photographs from movie stars including actresses Jenner Lawrence and Kirsten Dunst. It was horribly distressing for these women and I completely sympathise.However, the ease with which that slimy toad was able to access personal images proves thatyou don’t want to have potentially embarrassing photos put out there, then don’t take them in the first place — or just press the delete button.Maybe even go back to the Dark Ages, invest in a Polaroid camera and keep your naughty pictures under lock and key. The hackers are vile, but let us not give them the ammunition. And take heed of the advice from wise women such as Whoopi.I SINCERELY hope the latest rumours from the troubled set of the new Bond film prove to be without foundation.It’s being claimed that the film’s director, Cary Fukunaga, held up cast and crew during a complicated shoot because he was playing video games on his PlayStation.Apparently the production crew and actors were not amused at having to hang about for three hours because Cary wanted to play with his toys.

So it’s odd to see images and videos of strange, orange people with impossibly white teeth, like Molly-Mae Hague on my online news feeds and splashed across magazines when I haven’t a blinking clue who they are.And it is utterly bizarre that they all look and sound exactly alike.To be honest,I really need to see fit youngsters strutting around, uttering meaningless sounds and having sex, I will tune into a David Attenborough documentary.THE Fab Five presenters on makeover show Queer Eye are making the world a better place – one scruffy, messed-up person at a time.Makeovers are hardly a new concept but this series does much more than give someone a new outfit and haircut.The hosts lovebomb shy misfits who ask for help, as well as big-hearted people who just neglect themselves – then change their lives for ever.It’s a show full of heart and soul and I blub during every episode.This week I met the British star of Queer Eye, delightful Tan France, from Doncaster. He had a hard time growing up in a world where he had no role models and he feels a huge responsibility to young gay Asian men such as himself.Tan and the Queer Eye boys feature in the video for Taylor Swt’s new single, You Need To Calm Down, with some of my favourite people including RuPaul and Ryan Reynolds.The song hits you over the head a bit with its inclusivity – no bad thing – but the Queer Eye boys do it better just by being themselves.I HAD to look twice at this gorgeous selfie posted by This Morning’s Alison Hammond.She’s glowing with confidence and happiness.After becoming the spokeswoman for a slimming club Alison has lost so much weight and looks stunning.She has talked about being “embarrassed” by weighing st.

The Little Britain star saw on Twitter that Amy Dunn was being bullied because she had lost her hair and was being derided as a “Matt Lucas lookalike”.The comedian immediately sent the -year-old a message of support telling her she was beautul and how flattered he was to be compared to her.Amy, who suffers from alopecia, has had people laughing and pointing at her in the street because she happens to have a condition that means she is bald.I hope having Matt on her side has cheered Amy up and given her the confidence to ignore the morons who hurled abuse, and maybe even feel sorry for them for being such ar**holes.Matt is right. Amy is beautul, and so is he.I’M very much liking the look of Beecham House, the new ITV drama set in th Century India that airs tomorrow night.The trails look sumptuous and now Poldark’s Aidan Turner has gone all grungy, leading man Tom Bateman is a most welcome piece of eye candy.Beecham House is on ITV tomorrow at pm.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris will only be our th Prime Minister since the very first, Robert Walpole, who was in office from  to .The fact that more than a third of them went to Eton , suggests that social mobility in this country is in terminal decline.Indeed, when it comes to the children of ordinary homes reaching the highest office in the land, social mobility is stone-cold dead.Fee-paying privilege provides the fast-track to power. Yet it wasn’t always this way.There was a golden age of ­meritocracy in the last century when it was normal for our PMs to be educated by the state.Eton was still a bastion of academic excellence in those happy years. So was Harrow, which has produced seven Prime Ministers, and Westminster, which educated six.But between  and , there was enough healthy social mobility in this country for Harold Wilson, Ted Heath, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major — all educated at state schools — to become Prime Minister.Major and Callaghan didn’t even go to university. Callaghan couldn’t afford it, while Major left school at  with three O-levels.All five came from modest ­backgrounds, although Wilson, Heath and Thatcher were clever enough to get into Oxford University.For more than three decades, state-educated politicians competed with those who were the product of expensive private educations — and beat them to the top job.This is not an argument against Boris Johnson becoming Prime ­Minister simply because he went to Eton. Boris seems like the man most likely to prevent a Marxist government. This would destroy our economy — a fate far worse than either staying in or leaving the European Union.SoI was a Tory MP or party member, then I would probably prefer Boris to take on Brussels, Corbyn and the Brexit Party.But yet another old Etonian in  Downing Street proves that social mobility is nowhere near what it was in the last century. Andwe care about a fair and equal society, then that should concern us all.It feels signicant that the first candidate to be eliminated from the Tory leadership race was Esther McVey — the candidate from  the least privileged background, reinforcing the belief that Westminster is a closed shop.But when it comes to getting on in le, and even getting to Downing Street, it should not matter a damn where you were born.Your ability — and your willingness to graft — should matter far more than Mummy and Daddy’s bank ­balance.Le can never be totally fair. But two Old Etonian PMs in less than ten years is grotesque.  If there is to be a bright, shining future for this country after we leave the EU, there MUST be more social mobility.Once he has sorted out Brexit  and buried Corbyn, perhaps our Old ­Etonian PM will do something about it. Because inequality is still entrenched at birth.And that stinks.WHAT is mankind’s greatest invention  The Internet  The printing press  The steam engine  Penicillin If, like me, you are allergic to penicillin, then the gold shorts that Kylie Minogue wore in her Spinning Around promo probably have the edge on all of them. Kylie’s gold gear might make a comeback when she plays Glastonbury next Sunday.And  years after their debut, nobody has ever developed an allergy to them.As the wolf evolved into the dog, it sussed that making its eyes bigger made the humans go all soft and gooey inside.Dr Juliane Kaminski, of the University of Ports- mouth, says: “The evidence is compelling that dogs developed a muscle to raise the inner eyebrow after they were domesticated from wolves. It seems to elicit a strong desire in humans to look after them.”Those puppy-dog eyes are designed to make your heart melt.Certainly when Stan, our Cavalier King Charles spaniel, looks at me with his enormous, big round peepers, I understand the three little words he is trying to say.Give. Stan. Cheese.IT is weird the way even the greatest TV series can go off the boil.On the surface, the second series of Killing Eve has everything that made the first such a blast.Jodie Comer is still brilliant as psychopathic assassin Villanelle, doing a iety of convincing accents and changing her clothes more often than Diana Ross in concert.Sandra Oh is again wonderful as the sexually confused, domestically challenged spook.But I have watched the entire second series now and it just doesn’t catch fire the way the first did.And that is because the first series of Killing Eve had three female stars in Jodie Comer, Sandra Oh and – behind the scenes – Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who wrote the script.Now Waller-Bridge has gone off to save the screenplay of the next James Bond movie.And Killing Eve badly misses her magic dust.JEW-HATING has become the racism  that is permissible.The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, told the Cambridge Union debating society that his Jewish friends: “Are not like the other Jews – that’s why they are my friends.”He got a laugh.If he had said “black” or “Muslim”, he would have been nicked.THERE are some scary TV shows out there.Doing Question Time is daunting because you can be certain that at least half of the audience will hate your guts.Have I Got News For You  is forbidding because the ageing team captains and presenters have been doing it since the dawn of time and are used to the show’s format .But nothing comes close to the terror factor of Mastermind.To sit in that black leather chair as the lights go down is to know true stage fright. So Hamish Cameron must have been a very brave man indeed.Hamish held the record for the most appearances on Mastermind –  – and after filming the final last November, he learned he had terminal cancer.Shortly before the final was broadcast last week, Hamish died at the age of .The BBC had considered postponing the broadcast as a mark of respect but Hamish had instructed his family that he wanted the show to go on.As someone who vowed “never again” after sitting in that hot seat just the once, I can only salute Hamish’s courage.The Mastermind catchphrase “I’ve started so I’ll finish” could have been invented for this fearless man.IF Heathrow gets a third runway, then the impact on the environment will be huge, with hundreds of extra flights landing and taking  off every day.And that’s just for Emma Thompson!Their honeymoon must have been filthy.ANDREA LEADSOM says she was told by senior Tory women that they could not back her because the party couldn’t have “another woman” Prime Minister so soon after Theresa May.But the Tories’ past willingness to be led by a woman is surely something to celebrate.  The Conservatives will almost certainly be on their third female Prime Minister before the -year-old male-dominated Labour Party has its first.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why feel guilty about watching it The appeal of this show is fairly obvious — it’s the intimate access you get.Viewers feel like they’re on holiday on on the island too, as invisible guests.The ultimate fly-on-the-wall experience.We hear the most private of conversations, witness the most explosive fallouts. We even get in the shower with them.It’s so intimate that it feels the same as when you read someone ’s diary.Of course, we are watching insanely beautul people parading around in tiny scraps of swimwear. But no matter how gorgeous the contestants, each one is revealed to be as fragile as the next.I think that is where our real fascination lies.Surely they should all be full of confidence, looking the way they do  And yet they seem to be just as insecure as the rest of us.I like the fact that the show is a portal into a generation to which I no longer belong.I’ve learned so much about how young men and women behave and, until Maura uttered the words, I didn’t even know it was possible to have “fanny flutters”.Another thing I like is the escapism. Surely it’s no coincidence that Love Island is at peak popularity during a time when the news is totally dominated with gloom, doom — and Brexit.Personally, I’m also intrigued by the fake hair and nails — and the very y process of getting ready for a night out. I’m luckyI put a comb through my hair.The amount of make-up they manage to get on to their faces is astonishing — although the irony is that the one girl all the guys seem to like, Lucie, is a surfer chick who doesn’t wear make-up.There is also a real cruelty to the show, though. There is always someone better, someone more chosen. The voting process is brutal and leaves all of the contestants anxious about whether or not people like them.This show strips people of everything that is important, other than their body. They are measured on what they look like and little .As a result, lots of people have questioned the damage caused to the mental health of the contestants.There have been more than , complaints to Ofcom about this series already.But there are good things about Love Island.While it’s not exactly the kind of equality that women have been fighting for over the past  years, there’s no denying that female members in the house are as free as the men to proposition members of the opposite sex.In my day, all we had was: “My mate fancies you.” But Maura said of one guy that he gave her “fanny flutters”.When my daughter Sophia was asked to go on the show, she thought it would be fun to be on a free holiday. You can see her point.But no mother wants to watch their child on Love Island. We all know there are plenty of things our kids do that we don’t know about — and that’s the way it should stay.But it’s not just that. One reason I enjoy being part of the Apprentice is because it celebrates young people for their skills, ambition and what they achieve.They know they aren’t being valued for their looks — they are being valued for so much more than that.That said, no one’s self- esteem should be based on how others value us.I’ve often thought that my biggest superpower is that I really don’t care what people think about me.When I’m on the beach I’m not bothered about which bits and pieces are jiggling.Why  Because there is so much more to me than what I look like in a bikini.Or, rather, as a footballer’s we once said to me: “All I’ve got is my looks — at least you’ve got your personality.”I know it was a back-handed compliment. But you know what, I’m fine with that.LOTTIE Moss said on social media that she feels “uncomfortable” with her weight at the moment – as she posted a picture of herself in a dress on a night out.My first thought was she’s going to look back at those photos when she is in her fties and wonder how she could have felt uncomfortable when she looked like this.My second was she can’t worry that much because the dress she’s wearing is almost completely see-through.BOSSES of the Isle of Wight Festival have been criticised by two mental-health charities for banning Jess Glynne for le after the singer cancelled her show at the last minute, owing to anxiety.Anxiety is a debilitating condition which blights the lives of many people.I’m sorry to hear that Jess is one of those people.But when she knows she suffers from this condition, her choice to stay out partying with the Spice Girls until am on the day she was due to perform seems, well, questionable.Having been out drinking all night before work is enough to make even the most level-headed person anxious.To then go on social media advertising that fact, before effectively phoning in sick to work, is also a tad foolish.By doing that, Glynne gave the impression she chose partying over a commitment – and that is not a good look.If we have one job to do as parents, it is to teach our kids the importance of doing the things that need to be done, when they need to be done, whether you like it or not.When I see a young person doing what they said they would do, despite challenges, I know they’ve got backbone.It’s called resilience, grit, determination, and it’s about being irrepressible. Those are some of the most admirable traits a person can have.Anxiety is awful but it’s certainly not helped by partying until the early hours of a work day.THIS week there has been good and bad news for Boris Johnson. The good news is that it looks ashe is going to be our next Prime Minister.The bad news is not that early-hours row with his partner – it’s his new haircut.He used to have “The Trump”, a sort of comb-forward that hid his balding. But his barber has cut it off and, instead of the long-haired blond bombshell look, he’s now a blond basin with thinning top.Boris, please take it from me, when you go into a hairdresser’s the first thing you do is check out the hairstyle of the person holding the scissors.Anyway, I guess it grows back – and soon will be the haystack it’s always been. Now all Boris needs is a new suit.OOPS! My heart goes out to the mum of the rampaging toddler at a Swiss art show who knocked over a sculpture of a fly worth £,.My main question, though, is how a plastic sculpture of a fly could be worth so much money Someone, somewhere, is having a laugh. Right I WAS trying to work out what was unusual about the recent photo of actor Rob Lowe on the red carpet.I realised it’s this. He is a handsome, successful star who is still with his we – Sheryl Berkoff – after  years without trading her in for a younger model.And they look happy.A rare sight in Hollywood, so good luck to both of them.TO be fair, Sofia Richie pretty much pulled it off when she sported the latest bicycle shorts onesie – the trend you prayed would never happen.But all I can say is, I’m glad I don’t follow fashion.WHAT’S in a word  You might think nothing much. And it’s a small thing in a way, but Sainsbury’s needs to be called out for assuming on its hair-removal product that all doctors are male.Its instructions say: “Consult your usual doctor and show him the packaging.”No doubt lots of people will respond by saying that us women are far too easily offended.But it is assumptions such as this behind the fact that, for every £ a man makes, a woman only makes p.We have to stamp out this unconscious bias by calling it out every time we see it.AMAZING that it’s  years since Friends hit our TVs.But judging by pictures of its stars Jenner Aniston, , and Courteney Cox, , on vacation in their bikinis, they still look fantastic.Even more amazing is that they are genuine friends.It just goes to show thatyou eat well, work out and look after yourself, you don’t have to be fat and flabby at .*Note to self – eat better and go to the gym. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It seems there’s one rule for the MPs and another for them.”MPs are allowed to claim for a TV licence in their constituency office, according to Ipsa, and were eligible to claim for one for their second home until .More than , people have signed petitions calling on the Government to protect free TV licences for over-s.The end of the universal free TV licence for the over-s is a breach of the  Tory election manesto but the current Government is powerless to step in because it handed over responsibility for funding the TV licence fee to the BBC in  as part of its new charter.But Matt Hancock, a former Culture Secretary, said the BBC should reverse the decision by slashing costs where in the organisation.He also said he would conduct a radical overhaul of the way the BBC is run so it is fit for the digital age.Mr Hancock said: “They should live within their means. The bigger question is what the BBC will do to fund itself in the digital age where in a decade’s time it won’t be clear what a “TV” is anymore.An unprecedented number of letters were sent in to The Sun following the BBC’s announcement that it would start means-testing for the giveaway from June  .Furious pensioners registered their backing for our campaign to reverse the BBC decision.Many branded the concept of a licence fee as “outdated” in a world of digital streaming.Others said it was immoral for BBC boss Tony Hall to penalise pensioners when he was paying sky-high salaries to presenters such as Gary Lineker and Graham Norton.Campaigners said that although the changes appear to make the system fairer it will make watching TV unaffordable for , pensioners.Elderly Brits took to the airwaves to vent their anger and disappointment at the BBC yesterday, with GMB Presenter Susanna Reid fighting back tears when an elderly woman explained how TV was her main source of entertainment and begged the Beeb to rethink its decision.The BBC’s callous decision to sting .million OAPs for £ a year — pleading poverty despite its £billion annual subsidy — should be the last straw.Hundreds of thousands  may forget to pay, or refuse. And it will be an outrageANY of society’s most vulnerable people are dragged to court and punished.If the Government will not scrap the licence fee entirely, the BBC must cut executive salaries and waste, reduce its services and relent over old folk.If it won’t, its power must be limited to cutting off services, like an energy firm does as a last resort, and only then the live TV or iPlayer the licence covers.Luckily there’s plenty more now to watch."},{"url":null,"title":"lingerie thief shop window","story":"The woman dropped her clothes and put on a pinched bra and knickers before putting her togs back on over the top, cops said.But she had no idea a packed crowd had gathered outside the department store in central Manchester and was watching her every move.A pair of officers watched the charade unfold and nicked the woman after alerting the store.A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: “In a bizarre end to Manchester Day a short time ago a woman has allegedly stripped in Harvey Nichols, put lingerie on then put her clothes over the top in an attempt to steal said lingerie.“I can only assume she did not know she was doing this in front of a nd floor window.“Two of our officers attention was been drawn by hundreds of people cheering so they’ve looked up and seen this crime in progress, alerted the store and detained the woman.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And today Conservative members in Brecon and Radnorshire confirmed they have re-selected the -year-old on a Tory ticket. Thanking members today, Mr Davies said: A lot has been achieved over the past four years, but there is so much more to do, and I am the right person to do it. Local Tory chairman Peter Weavers said: Chris is local, he knows the area, he knows the constituents, knows the issues and problems we face, and that matters. The Lib Dems will now throw the kitchen sink at the seat, which they held from  to , in a bid to overturn the MPaposs , majority. The leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats , Jane Dodds, will stand and claimed it was a golden opportunity.

Labour trailed in third place in Brecon with , votes in , to the Toriesapos , and Lib Demsapos ,.The by-election will be held towards the end of July at the earliest - with timing overseen by the Tory whips. The shamed Tory was booted out of office, triggering the by-election, after losing a recall petition in his Welsh seat. Some , people signed a petition - almost double the ,threshold needed. The petition was triggered by a criminal conviction of giving  information for his Westminster expenses.Davies was fined £, in March but spared jail at Southwark Crown Court after he pleaded guilty to two charges. Davies was told he had committed two very serious offences which were absolutely intended to deceive when he appeared before magistrates earlier this year. Sentencing him, judge Mr Justice Edis said: It seems shocking that when confronted with a simple accounting problem, you thought to forge documents. That is an extraordinary thing for a man with your position and your background to do. However he was not thrown out of the Conservative Party, receiving only a formal warning. The first charge was providing  or misleading information for allowances claims, contrary to section  of the Parliamentary Standards Act . In March  he made a claim under the MPsapos allowances scheme and provided an invoice that he knew to be  or misleading, the court heard. The second charge was attempting to provide  or misleading information for allowances claims, contrary to the act. It related to an attempt in April  to make a claim using an invoice that he knew to be  or misleading. Two previous charges of forgery were dropped. Mr Davies previously made an unreserved apology, telling journalists:  I made a mistake and at no point did I at any time try to make any financial gain.

The presenter and journalist, , was seen travelling with her whippet, Moody, on a busy Great Western train to London Paddington this afternoon. There were few empty seats but she let her dog curl up next to her. Other paying passengers had to look ­where for a place to sit. A witness said: “I was really surprised to see the dog on the seat. There wasn’t even a mat or newspaper underneath it. “For someone who is very much in the public eye, who holds politicians to account, I would have expected her to behave better. “When I boarded the train it was really busy. A lady was looking for a seat and ended up sitting behind Emily and not on a seat with a table, where there is more room. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\" “Some people chose to stand, as there were few spare seats. It shows a lack of respect for other passengers to feel it appropriate for dogs to sit on seats meant for passengers. “It’s a question of courtesy and consideration for others. The dog should have been on the floor. It could have been dirty or could have had ticks or fleas.” The witness, going from Reading, Berks to London, said Maitlis’s dog slept on the Penzance to London service for at least  minutes before Paddington.  Last week, Maitlis, one of ­Britain’s most respected interviewers, was criticised over her handling of the televised Tory leadership debate with hundreds of BBC viewers accusing her of losing control of the candidates and failing to get answers. Bruce Williamson, of the ­Railfuture campaign, said expensive train fares mean “people who have paid for a ticket must come first”. He added: “I’m surprised a conductor didn’t say something about it.  I’m a dog lover, but dogs on trains are essentially luggage and second-class ­citizens to humans. Seats should be reserved for first and ­foremost for humans. “It just highlights the level of overcrowding on our railways and the shortage of seats.” A railway passenger group said Maitlis broke one of the network operators rules. Fraser Pithie, of the Campaign for Rail, said: “The rules do not give animals any right to take up seats. Dogs must remain on the floor. Even guide dogs are not allowed on seats. A train guard should have spoken to her.”  A spokesman from Great Western confirmed the company does allow people to bring animals on their trains but said they are never allowed on seats. National Rail conditions say: “Animals are not allowed on seats in any circumstances” and warn a charge could be madeanimals occupy seats. In a statement, Maitlis said: “There was no one without a seat looking to sit down. “The dog was under the table for the first three hours of the journey whilst four people sat down at it. He came on to the seat for the last  minutes of the journey when the seat next to me became free.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sky news admit theyll cancel","story":"NewsSky News admit theyll have to CANCEL TV debate due to bottler Boris JohnsonSources close to Jeremy Hunt blasted \"bottler Boris\" as Sky News was forced to offer an alternative date and timeShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JUN NewsThe frontrunner to be Prime Minister still hasnt confirmed he will attend \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Sky News admitted today they will have to CANCEL a Tory leadership debatebottler Boris Johnson doesnapost turn up.The frontrunner to be Prime Minister still hasnapost confirmed he will attend less than  hours before the TV showdown.Now Sky News have issued a statement admitting tomorrow nightaposs head-to-head, hosted by Kay Burley and against leadership rival Jeremy Hunt , will not proceed without him.The broadcaster has now invited both men to take part in a debate on July  instead.

At that time, LGBT people were invisible. We were not on TV or radio or film.  We were not mentioned in newspapers and magazines. We were not running companies or schools or for political office. This invisibility meant that we existed only in whispers and rumors. To religious organisations we were immoral, to law enforcement we were illegal, to the medical profession we were maled.    We couldn’t be doctors, lawyers or teachers. We were professionally unemployable.  This meant, in that era, we had to lead double lives.That idea of not being who I truly was led me to frustration and to anger, and that is why, at , I moved to New York City. I wanted to be with people like me, in the only place I knew we existed. I arrived May th, , with little money and no job or prospects.If I wished to live my le openly, which I did, I knew it would be rough going. However, that move proved pivotal for me. I didn’t know it at that time, but I was part of a new generation that would no longer tolerate the maltreatment that society felt entitled to give us. On Friday night, June th, and the early hours of the th, like almost every other night of the week, I found myself at Stonewall. For me and people like me, it was our safe place. On the street, we couldn’t hold hands or even show fleeting affection without being harassed, beaten, or arrested.    Inside the Stonewall, we could not only be ourselves and order drinks and show affection – we could dance.  And at , that is what I wanted to do. That night, well into the evening, the lights flickered. Then, they remained on. We knew what was coming because it had happened before. We saw police barging in and shoving and slamming people against the walls as hard as they hurled their insults. They then seemed to zero in on anyone who looked professional and demanded they take out their wallets and hand over their cash.  The police were stealing and they felt they could do it because in their eyes we were worthless. That extortion was when the anger began to build. It simmered as they let us out of the bar one by one. If you were a professional, had a bright future, or had family in the area, as soon as you got out of the bar you ran for the subway. But those of us who had nothing, we stayed. Eventually, there were more of us outside the bar than inside.   We were the street kids, the drag queens, the new gay and lesbian activists. We circled the door and cheered each person let out by the police. Once the cops had taken what they could, they thought they’d just leave andto their happy heterosexual lives. They peeked their heads out the front door. We were still there. They demanded we disperse. We did not. That routine occurred a couple of times, and on their third attempt we started to toss stones, empty cans and anything  we could at those doors.   The police were imprisoned by us: a group that they systematically imprisoned, harassed, beat. And they were not only trapped for a moment. It took them an hour to call for reinforcements.  Outside it was almost like a party. We didn’t psychologically know it but we felt, for the first time, a feeling of freedom. People were running up and down the street, rushing to let others know what was happening.  Someone put a feathered boa on the statue of General Sheridan across the street from Stonewall, welcoming him to the event. That is the most fascinating memory for me, that we were in a state of joy, we were fighting back. While there was singing that night, there was no kick line. That legend would come weeks later as the first myths of Stonewall began to build. What did happen was Marty Robinson, one of the new breed of activists, appearing with chalk, asking me and others to write on the streets and walls of Christopher Street: “Tomorrow Night Stonewall.”   That is how the second night of Stonewall was organised. That night, we had speakers from the front steps of a closed Stonewall, declaring what we needed to do, what must be done. This was our community claiming our territory, taking our street back, and daring the police, daring the people who had oppressed us for so long, to interfere. They didnapost. From the ashes of Stonewall came Gay Liberation Front, GLF, which created the LGBT community we all know today. It was welcoming of youth, people of color and trans people. It created an open community where there was none, and it gave to the world a lasting legacy in what it created that first year after Stonewall, culminating in the first Gay Pride in , Christopher Street Gay Liberation Day. First we took back our pride. Then, we created a community. Happy Gay Pride, UK. Mark Segal, a Stonewall participant and GLF member, is the publisher of The Philadelphia Gay News.  His memoir “And Then I Danced: Traveling The Road To LGBT Equality, was named best book of  by the National Lesbian Gay Journalistaposs Association, and has been excerpted in The Stonewall Reader and many other publications. He can be seen on the Smithsonian Channel documentary “Smithsonian Time Capsule: Beyond Stonewall,” airing Monday, June  at  PM.

Some of my colleagues took offence to the Billy Connelly, , thoughts on religion, that I posted early May. Itaposs been a pleasure working with my friends and serving the public of Dewsbury and I will miss my regular customers x. He later wrote: Feeling lost today. I would be getting prepared for my busy Sunday afternoon sht.  - . oh well Iaposve got to get past this feeling. The dismissal letter from Asda said he admitted the post was offensive, that he removed it and apologised to affected colleagues.  It said he had committed a gross misconduct offence, and his Facebook post had the potential to bring the company into disrepute. His apology to bosses read: I fully acknowledge my sharing of material online within my Facebook account regarding religion has upset many people and understand it to be a very serious breach of the company social media policy. In mitigation, I immediately removed the item causing offence and removed the association with Asda on my profile, also removing Colleagues from Facebook friendship who may have been deeply offended by such post. I have spoken to affected Colleagues apologising for my post, taking their feedback onboard. I have realised peopleaposs faiths are very important to them, and the nature of the post regarding the sensitive nature of it relating to the holy place of Islam. If I had faith I can imagine being very upset myself. Saying that the post shared is a joke by Billy Connellynot my personal views. But I recognise how colleagues may think this is my view. As a result I will think very carefully before posting online or saying anything that could be interpreted as hurtful to others and my place of work. He added: I believe this has been a wake up call and will not be repeated. I would like the opportunity to prove that this post does not reflect who I am. An Asda spokesman said: We would never comment on inidual circumstances. However we do not tolerate any form of discrimination from colleagues or customers and take such behaviour extremely seriously.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i lived vegan food week","story":"NewsWhat I learnt living as a vegan for a week - and how much it costThere are now , vegans in the UK, but would the switch to a plant-based diet be too much for this convert ShareCommentsByAnna Reilly:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsThe cost of some vegan items could put people off\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVeganism is gaining in popularity across the UK, with over half a million Britons claiming to follow plant-based diets. The dramatic growth has seen a  per cent increase of self-professed vegans in the last  years, according to the Vegan Society.While vegans were once the butt of jokes, preconceptions have changed about those that swear off meat, dairy, and animal products, with more and more changing diet in a bid to improve our health as well as being kinder to the planet.Switching to veganism can see  fewer animals slaughtered yearly for meat, and thereaposs also plenty of evidence to show that a meat-free diet is the single biggest way to reduce our impact on the earth.HullLive reporter Anna Riley decided to give the vegan diet a go for a week - hereaposs how she got on.   It was tough at first The whole premise of  veganism  is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. This means eating a plant-based diet, avoiding all foods such as meat, fish and shellfish, dairy, eggs and even honey as well as animal-derived materials and products tested on animals. As commendable as this lestyle is, for a le-long meat eater, as well as often eating eggs and a LOVER of cheese, the challenge to go coldturkey was certainly a tough one. It was dficult at first to think of tasty vegan recipes to make for my meals that would be tasty compared to the meat and fish that were staples in much of the food I was used to eating.  Luckily, my almost vegan friendhelped me out when I asked for advice on what to shop for, and advised me to eat fruit for snacks, as well as stocking up on vegetables, nuts, beans and pulses to make a iety of meals that she sent over, including stews, curries, salads, stir fry and more. She also signposted me to plenty of vegan inspired recipes to look at online for inspiration.    It was more expensive and took time to shop Because I needed to replace all the dairy items that I normally had with vegan alternatives, my shop cost me nearly £ just for staples and snacks, much more than it normally wouldI was buying ordinary milk, cheese, butter, yoghurts, crisps and chocolate. Along with spending more on these items, there was also a much more limited selection on offer. I could only find two ieties of vegan cheese in the Tesco extra store in Hull St Stephenaposs Centre, which I was surprised by, and there was only a small selection of dairy free yoghurts. I went to Aldi for my main fruit and veg shop and was happily surprised to find a vegan section there, which included curry pots, sweet potato and beetroot burgers and red pepper and butternut squash sausages, as well as low calorie vegan pea snap crisps, so I snapped all of these up along with the lentils, beans, tinned tomatoes and spices in my trolley. As I wasnapost buying meat or fresh fish, which can add up, and instead bulking up on veg, Iaposd say that in the end I spent roughly as much as normal on my shop,not a little more for the vegan alternatives and ready meals. It also took me more time than normal to shop, as not many products are already labelled aposveganapos, so I had to scour the back of many packets to check that they contained no animal product at all, and even accidentally ended up getting cereal bars that werenapost vegan, as they had honey in them. One evening on my late sht I also had to grab something at Tesco for tea on my break but there were no vegan sandwiches in sight, as egg and cheese were the only meatless options, so I ended up shelling out £ for a tofu ready meal that was granted very tasty, but also very costly.    Tea rounds and office snacks were a no go Not wanting to bring a large carton of dairy free milk to work just for hot drinks for myself, I didnapost join in with the tea rounds other than to have a black coffee, and even then my colleagues would forget that I was aposoff milkapos and accidentally add it to my drink when they were making me one. Food Reviews  I also had to dodge the snacks that my kind colleagues brought into the office such as chocolate doughnuts and cakes, as they were also made with dairy products. Clearly, dairy is a lot more prominent in our everyday lives than I once thought. The food was tasty    I thought that I would be hankering for meat throughout the week, being used to eating it on a regular basis, but the food I made and ate was actually delicious - and the vegan cheese was even palatable, but of course not as good as the original version. There was plenty of iety in what I had and I didnapost feel like I was missing out with the vegan diet. The only thing that I did yearn for towards the end of the week was eggs, as I do enjoy them now and again for breakfast or in a fritatta or quiche. The vegan ready meals from the supermarket are definitely something Iaposd eat again, and Iaposd make some of the same recipes again, including the butternut squash bangers and mash, veggie stir fry, lentil stew, ratatouille, and curry, with plenty also for leftovers the next day. I also didnapost miss milk or yoghurt, with the dairy free alternatives tasting just as good andnot better in my porridge, tea, coffee and smoothies, and the dairy free butter even being nice on toast. The vegan chocolate also went down well, and I couldnapost get enough of the pea snack crisps. Other than the taste, another thing I noticed about the vegan meals was that I was not as full as I normally would be when eating a non-plant based meal, and felt hungrier than normal, perhaps because I wasnapost getting enough protein or eating enough carbs. Eating out was dficult    Despite their being places in Hull that cater for vegans , it was dficult to find a iety of choice when eating out at restaurants which cater to mainly meat eaters. I felt very picky when I went out for dinner to a aposnon-veganapos eatery, and was disappointed at the menu choice for my needs. Luckily there are places near me like Zoo Café which have a wide iety of veggie and vegan meals and donapost serve meat, but it would be nicer to see more vegan options on the menu at other restaurants around the city. I avoided wine and beer  Much to my dismay, and previously unbeknown to me, I found buying beer and wine a faff, as it can be processed using animal products such as isinglass , egg whites, caseinand even bone marrow, making it non-veganprocessed in this way. There are several common fining agents that are animal-friendly and used to make vegan wine and beer like limestone and silica gel as suitable alternatives, but it takes time to look for this on the back of a bottle, and is often more expensive, so I just gave booze and the pub a swerve for the week. But fortunately, virtually every brand of hard liquor like bourbon, whiskey, vodka, gin, and rum is vegan, so I took heart in this should I have wanted a drink. I felt better for it  Throughout the challenge, I actually had more energy through following the vegan diet, which gave me the boost to exercise more, and by the end of the week Iaposd actually lost weight and felt much better in general. My skin was also clearer, perhaps because I was eating healthier, and sorryitaposs oversharing, but I also noticed that I went to the toilet a lot more because I was consuming more fibre through all the veg, which may have also contributed to the weight loss. I also felt better morally that I was doing my bit for the planet and animals through the diet. Final thoughts  Even though I found the concept of going vegan for a week quite daunting, and found it dficult at first, I actually really benefited from the experience and would recommend everyone to at least give it a try to see how they get on. Iaposm certainly not saying that Iaposm going to turn my nose up to a crispy bacon sandwich from now on, or demand a nut roast instead of traditional old chicken, nor will I refuse a sausage and a beef burger at a barbecue, or shun a pizza topped with all the cheese. But living off a purely plant based diet has made me think just how much we rely on animal products, and how ingrained they are in our daily lives, which can be at times unhealthy. Iaposll happily give up milk, yoghurts and butter from now on, as I felt much better for consuming the non-dairy alternatives, and Iaposm going to make more of an effort to make more vegan meals as they taste great, and are better for the environment.

The -year-old didnapost realise how big he had grown until he appeared on Robert Rinderaposs ITV reality show in , when his mum Tracy tried to settle an alleged £, debt. Mr Yafai has lost a staggering st and is feeling so confident about himself he has joined Tinder to date for the first time in years.  The kidsapos home manager said he looked disgusting when he appeared on Judge Rinder, and vowed to make big changes to his le. Mr Yafai, who stands ft in, started walking  miles a day, changed his diet and underwent gastric bypass surgery. He now weighs st.He told the Daily Star: “I hated everything about how I looked. No matter what angle they filmed me from, I was disgusting.” Mr Yafai stopped taking the bus to work and began walking back and forth every day because he was so embarrassed over his weight. He added: “None of this would have been possible without Judge Rinder – being on that show, watching myself and thinking enough’s enough. “Truth is, Judge Rinder saved my le.”  Mr Yafai initially lost st and was told he wasnapost eligible for gastric bypass surgery on the NHS. He gained st in four months, but saved up £, for private gastric bypass surgery in the Czech Republic. In that operation, the top part of the stomach is joined to the small intestine. People feel fuller sooner when they eat, and they donapost absorb as many calories from food.  In less than six months, he lost st - bringing his weight down to st. Mr Yafai says he has never felt so good and he now wants to use his experience to inspire others. People who undergo weight loss surgery on the NHS, including gastric bypass, are told to commit to making permanent lestyle changes to avoid putting weight back on.  They are urged to change their diet, exercise regularly and attend regular follow-up appointments to check how things are going after surgery. Weight loss surgery can carry a small risk of complications such as excess folds of skin that may need to be removed with further surgery, a lack of vitamins and minerals from the new diet, gallstones, a blood clot in the leg, the gastric band slipping out of place or food leaking from the join between the stomach and small intestine.

The four-year-old is the spitting image of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs second child, and her mum believes she looks more like her than the aposofficialapos lookalike. Her mum Gemma, , first noticed the similarities after someone pointed it out in Primark last year. She said: Marcy looks more like Princess Charlotte than the official lookalike does. People stop us as weaposre walking past and say aposoh, she looks so much like Princess Charlotteapos or admit theyaposve had to do a double take.    The first time it happened we were in Primark in Meadowhall and the woman serving us said aposoh god your daughter looks like Princess Charlotteapos. I donapost know why anyone would think she would be in Meadowhall in Sheffield without her mum - Iaposm not Princess Kate! It never clicked until she said it, it was only when I looked at pictures of her that I realised she does. The checkout girl at Birmingham Airport last year when we went on holiday to Turkey was checking her passport and did a double take too. Itaposs very flattering, Princess Charlotte is such a lovely little girl - always good fun and always looks beautul, itaposs a very nice comparison.    Marcy, who lives in Sheffield with her mum and dad Dylan Culverwell, , is  months older than her royal lookalike and even likes to dress in similar outfits. She hates wearing trousers and is happiest in skirts and dresses, similar to little Charlotte. Gemma said: Marcy gets very upsetyou put her in trousers. She likes wearing skirts and dresses because she says she doesnapost want to look like a boy. If we go to the soft play Iaposll say she canapost wear a skirt because she would burn her bum on the slide or flash [people] and that she needs to have trousers on but it isnapost worth the hassle. At that point I just say aposput what you want onapos. She has a wide iety of clothing. I like things off eBay or Primark and then higher end designer items - I like to do a mixture for her. One of her nanas goes to America a lot so she brings her loads of clothes back from there.    I wouldnapost go to the extreme of dressing her like Princess Charlotte but itaposs nice when people comment. Gemma said that more and more people have started commented on the similarity between her in the last year - both online and in person. And although not signed up with an agency Gemma said sheaposs open to little Marcy doing lookalike work. Gemma said: People have commented on photos Iaposve shared on social media saying how much she looks like her. Marcy didnapost look like her when she was a baby but has started to now that sheaposs older.    I put up a picture of Marcy next to a picture of Princess Charlotte and those who already thought it agreed. Other people commented saying they didnapost realised how similar they were until I put them together. I even had a woman message me and say aposI nearly stopped you in the school yard the other day to tell you how much she looks like Princess Charlotteapos. Sheaposs not signed with anyone but we are open to the possibility of doing lookalike work in the future. Princess Charlotte is known for her confidence, and Gemma said her little girl has a matching aposfeistyapos personality. She has been competing in pageant competitions for the past year which her mum thinks has helped her come out her shell.    Gemma said: She can be quite shy when you first meet her and then she never stops talking. She loves having her picture taken - singing and dancing and doing little shows. The pageants sheaposs been doing for the last year have brought her on loads with her confidence and itaposs lovely watching her on stage performing. Marcy has quite a feisty edge to her but Princess Charlotte has too - theyaposre like your modern-day princesses. Iaposve showed Marcy pictures of her and said aposthis is who people think you look likeapos. She thinks sheaposs nice but doesnapost have that awareness yet of looking like somebody .    Marcy is always full of fun and adventure and always wanting to know everything thataposs going on. When you think you can have secret conversations in code, sheaposs already picked the code before youaposve decided what it is. Kids are hard work but the joy she brings you could never replace it.

Alfie had a PEG tube fitted into his stomach and in October last year needed to start dialysis. He now gets dialysis three times a week in two-and-a-half hour blocks. He is a very social wee child and he loves seeing everyone and talking away, said Hollie. He is so funny, just a wee character. He is the best wee thing ever and at the moment we are just getting more information about his transplant. One of us is hoping to donate a kidney to him and we hope that happens in the next year or two. It is a long process but we would do anything for him.

On June , Marissa Casey Fuchs, , shared a video on her account @fashionambitionist, in which her boyfriend Gabriel Grossman explained that he had the most important question of [his] le to ask her, but he didnapost want to do it in a traditional way. As a result, Marissa, who has more than , followers, was sent on a scavenger hunt to find her fiancé-to-be and a very sparkly ring.    The influencer, who works as the director of brand partnerships at Goop, was taken on a -hour whirlwind trip to ious locations, starting in New York and heading to Montauk, Miami and finishing in Paris. Along the way she and her closest friends stayed in fancy hotels, enjoyed luxurious meals and were given clues to help her work out when she would be getting engaged. Various brands and companies also made appearances along the way as she was aposgtedapos clothes and beauty looks to wear in her photos and videos. Eventually she ended up at Château Bouffémont, where her Prince Charming was waiting to get down on one knee, but that wasnapost the last surprise in store - the pairaposs families then emerged from inside the grand house and Fuchs was told sheaposd be getting married that very day.    Some people called the proposal insane and amazing but others thought it was fake and creepy.Speculation that the whole thing was just a clever marketing stunt was furthered when a pitch deck for the proposal was discovered by The Atlantic.The deck outlined every detail of the engagement, including a social media posting schedule, and is thought to have been sent out to potentially obtain sponsorship for Instagram content. Itaposs not clear whether any sponsorship was obtained for the Instagram posts as they werenapost tagged with #Ad or #Sponsored - but Grossman did receive discounts for items given to Marissa during the scavenger hunt and certain services, such as hair and make-up, were provided free of charge.    The pitch read: This summer, Marissa of @FashionAmbitionist will be pulled into a surprise adventure created by the center of her le, Gabriel. He will remotely ask her to take an unexpected and sentimental journey to him, a journey that will encompass many familiar stops along the way that offer their own unique gts. Weaposre pleased to offer your brand the opportunity to align with this momentous occasion and the beautul cities she will be visiting along the way. Despite this, Fuchsapos friend, Elicia Blaine Evans, claims the bride had no idea what was going on during the scavenger hunt and wasnapost involved in the planning of it -  but an industry insider thinks itaposs very unlikely they pulled it all off without her knowledge.Advertising executive Bryan Pederson, told The Atlantic : Either her fiancé has been intimately involved in every single aspect of her business and influencer marketing career and knows every detail of her influencer partnerships, or she has had some input into that pitch deck. Thereaposs no way a friend or potential fiancé would know how to put together a pitch deck with that much detail.Despite the criticism of his proposal, Grossman still feels it was the right way to pop the question to his partner as Instagram is such a big part of her le. He said: I was trying to do something that I knew Marissa would love. Itaposs not like the rest of my le is going on Bravo. I can be public for a bit for this one moment in our lives then it will go back to normal.

Three beaches were temporarily closed in the Costa Blanca holiday resort after two of the jellyfish-like creatures were spotted in the water yesterday. The first was found at Mal Pas beach, a little cove between the town’s main beaches. The second was discovered at the popular Levante beach. As a result, bathing was banned while attempts were made to remove the creatures. The stings suffered by seven people are said to have been “minor”, although five of the seven sunbathers were taken to hospital. It is not knownany were British or Irish.    Monica Gomez, Benidorm’s Councillor for Beaches, confirmed: “Benidorm Town Hall yesterday morning activated a Portuguese Man O’War protocol after two were found off town beaches. “They were removed by leguards. “As a precautionary measure bathing was banned and the red flag hoisted for an hour at the main Levante and Poniente beaches, and for more than two hours at Mal Pas beach. “Seven people were treated for minor stings caused by the jellyfish-like creatures at Mal Pas beach. “Five were taken to Villajoyosa Hospital, as part of protocol and as a precautionary measure. “We have acted swtly and diligently and banned bathing until we were sure there were no more Portuguese Man O’War in the water.” The Portuguese Man O’War is often called a jellyfish but is actually a species of siphonophore, a group of animals that are closely related to jellyfish.    Their tentacles are loaded with coiled, barbed tubes that deliver venom capable of paralysing and killing small fish and crustaceans. They are rarely deadly to people but can be dangerous to children, elderly people, asthmatics and people with allergies as they can cause fever, shock and respiratory distress. A woman was left with excruciating marks all over her body earlier this month after being stung by one of the creatures.Naomi Mateos, , was swimming at Puntas de Calnegre beach in Lorca, when she became ‘paralysed’ by a sharp sting.She said after a two-day stay in hospital: “I felt asfire or acid was being injected into my body.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy 5 could scarred life","story":"NewsBoy, , could be scarred for le after black henna tattoo causes horric burnAfter the temporary tattoo started to fade, a hot red lump started to appear on the boys arm, which has still not healedShareCommentsBySam Truelove:,  JUN NewsLouise Byrne fears her son Logan may be permanently scarred \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum fears her son may have permanent scarring on his arm after he suffered a chemical burn just days after getting a henna tattoo abroad.

The -year-old stay-at-home-mum thought nothing of the risks after seeing several other children with the same tattoo, but was horried when her son began suffering an extreme adverse reaction after ing home to Perth, Australia.  “Logan woke up and said his arm was sore, and it was really itchy hot, burning. I couldn’t believe what had happened,” Ms Byrne said. “It was very hot, red and lumpy. It got worse so we went to the doctor, who gave us a special cream.”After the temporarily tattoo started to fade, a hot red lump started to appear, Ms Byrne told Yahoo! News . Almost a month later, the wound has still not healed. Ms Byrne took her son to the doctor who said Logan was suffering a chemical burn from the dye. He was prescribed cortisone cream to help the dermatitis. The mum now fears the burn might never heal and her son could be left with permanent scarring. She is sharing her story to warn other parents about the potential dangers of getting temporary tattoos while on holiday.    The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advises travellers to avoid temporary black henna tattoos while overseas, stating that they “often contain a dye which can cause serious skin reactions”. Dr Adrian Lim, who teaches at the Australasian College of Dermatologists, warned reactions to henna tattoos can take seven to  days to occur.

The first full week of summer will be blistering in countries including Spain, France and Germany while the UK bakes in its hottest weather of the year. Very hot air from Africa is being pulled north over Europe, where much of the mainland will see at least one day of intense heat and high humidity will make it feel more like C. The hottest temperatures are expected in Paris, Madrid, Prague, Munich and Zurich, with temperatures expected to hit C in Spain, according to forecasters. Meanwhile temperatures could rise towards the mid s in the UK as hot weather threatens to spawn violent thunderstorms.    Britons heading abroad to central and western Europe this week or next weekend will endure even hotter temperatures. Temperatures will peak at C in Madrid on Thursday and Friday, and close to C in places such as Paris and Majorca. Forecasters have issued warnings and some cities have implemented emergency plans to help residents cope with the heat, especially those who donapost have air conditioning in their homes. In France, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo activated a heatwave action plan, and the countryaposs health minister, Agnes Buzyn, has told councils, hospitals and care homes to be prepared.    Last summeraposs heatwave killed , more people than usual in July and August. A severe heatwave in July and August  - described as the worst since  by meteorologists - resulted in almost , heat-related deaths in France. That summer, Paris hit a record high of .C, and temperatures are expected to near that mark this week, France  reported. Meteorologist Francois Gourandof Meteo-France, told reporters: We are expecting a heatwave that will affect more than half of France, of maximum intensity: the hottest day reached will be comparable to , not very far away in any case.    He said June temperature records are likely to be broken, adding: This heatwave promises to be unprecedented for a month of June. Paris has more than  cool places open to the public - including swimming pools and museums - and more than  of them will be open at night for those looking to escape the heat. Nights will be very warm, and it will be at least a week before there is relief from the heat. While most of France endures extreme heat, temperatures will be below normal in Normandy and Brittany, where thunderstorms are a risk.  Temperatures this week will be close to C in Milan, Rome and parts of Germany, including Frankfurt and Berlin, and in the mid s in Prague, Vienna, Brussels and Zurich. German forecaster Dominik Jung told Bild: “Three days in a row with up to  degrees. And in June. That hasn’t happened before. The Saharan nozzle blows its hot air directly to us. And the sun is at its highest so temperatures can build for longer.” Public health officials have told people to take precautions to stay cool and advised against drinking alcohol during the heatwave, which poses a particular threat to children and the elderly. The German tabloid Bild suggested people have a siesta in the afternoons and put their pyjamas in the freezer to help them stay cool at night.  The unusually warm weather is due to a storm stalling over the Atlantic Ocean and high pressure over central and eastern Europe, AccuWeather said. It added: Locations from Madrid to Paris, Belgium, Frankfurt and Berlin can expect a multi-day heat wave, with daily temperatures near or above C . The highest temperatures of the year so far are expected during this heat wave in cities such as Madrid, Milan, Prague, Munich and Zurich. The heatwave began in Spain on Sunday, with temperatures hitting C in Madrid, and it will spread into France on Monday.  AccuWeather said: By Tuesday, intense heat will be felt from Madrid to Berlin and Milan. In the UK, temperatures are forecast to rise to C in the south-east of England by Friday. Thunderstorms will batter parts of the country this week. The conditions have pulled very hot air from Africa over Europe, said AccuWeather, which has warned of a potentially dangerous heatwave. Scientists say climate change has made extreme heatwaves in Europe up to five times more likely to occur. In India, at least  people have died in a heatwave that has sent temperatures soaring to C this month.

Researchers believe the creature belongs to the genus Aristonectes, which was considered an outlier to other elasmosaurs because they have shorter necks and a larger skull.Jose O’Gorman, a paleontologist from Argentina, told National Geographic: “For years it was a mystery ... we didn’t knowthey were elasmosaurs or not. They were some kind of weird plesiosaurs that nobody knew.” The fossil was discovered on Seymour Island - close to the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula - in .Brutally cold weather and logistics meant that it took years for the fossil to be unearthed.Researchers could only dig for a few weeks in January and early February every year, and some years they were unable to visit the site at all.  Mr OaposGorman said: “The weather is one of the problems. The weather controls all. Maybe one day you can work, and the next day you cannot because you have a snowstorm. When the excavation finished in , much of the skeleton had been recovered. Mr OaposGorman said the creatureaposs diet likely included crustaceans and small fish. The fossil is now being analysed to learn more about the ancient sea reptile. Plesiosaurs been likened to the Loch Ness Monster and some even believe aposNessieapos somehow survived when the dinosaurs became extinct.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"high street fashions boost charity funds","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHigh Street style and a good cause drew fashion-conscious ladies from miles around to Lochgilphead Joint Campus.The Mid Argyll group of the Marie Curie charity hosted a special fundraising fashion show on Monday June  in association with Colours.An audience of around  eager shoppers were treated to fashion items from shoes to cardigans and handbags to floaty summer skirts, all well known brands at discount prices.The evening, which included a raffle featuring excellent prizes, raised around £, for Marie Curie, which offers support to people and families affected by terminal illness.Jenny Brolly of the Mid Argyll Marie Curie fundraising group said: #Once again thanks to the community for turning out to support Marie Curie.#An enjoyable evening was had by everyone.#"},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

didnrsquot think his time in the saddle with the Burgh Flag couldnrsquot get any more special, he spotted Granny Monks waiting for his Safe In .Isobel Monks has commanded the same spot at the Toll for decades.Craig explained: ldquoFor as long as I can remember my Granny has been in the same spot at the Toll.ldquoAs I was coming in with the Flag, I saw my Granny and that brought everything home to me ndash my grandfather, my dad and my brother having all come in at the toll with the burgh Flag before me.ldquoThe whole day has been amazing ndash beyond anything I could ever have hoped for ndash but seeing my Gran waiting for me was something .Weather warnings and heavy rain in the day or two leading up to Selkirk Common Riding had caused a bit of concern for many officials.But come Friday morning the rain-clouds had parted and the sun began to tip those welcoming hills with gold.Selkirkrsquos fabulous three bands ndash Flute, Silver and Pipe ndash set the tone for Souters frae arsquo the airts.Before the celebrations could begin, the solemn reminder of sacrice was respected at the War Memorial ahead of the Exiles and locals mustered outside the County Hotel.And as the numbers swelled even further, high above the growing gathering Craig Monks was Installed as Royal Burgh Standard Bearer on the balcony of the Victoria Halls.Having been brought up in a household proudly lsquoobsessedrsquo with the Common Riding, Craig had been waiting for this moment since childhood.And with a confident smile he relished his time in the saddle, at the head of a -strong cavalcade.Through the streaming Ettrick, up the Linglie to Tibbiersquos and onto the Three Brethren, the sun shone and the mounted cavalcade was Safe Oot.From over Peat Law and down the Nettlie, thousands back in Selkirk watched Standard Bearer Monksrsquo progress, ably assisted all the way by Attendants, Adam Nichol, Liam Cassidy, Conall Fairbairn and Andrew McColm.It was a Riding of the Marches that will live with Standard Bearer Craig Monks until the day he departs this earth.He later told us: ldquoIt had been non-stop in the weeks leading up to the Common Riding, so finally getting the Flag was brilliant.\"The weather was great and I really donrsquot think the day could have gone any better.ldquoIrsquove loved every second of being Standard Bearer and it was over before I knew

nothing provides focus on those cherished customs more than the Casting of the Colours.Silver skies illuminated the true-blue and scarlet bunting that decorates the ancient Market Place on Friday morning.And beneath, high on the plinth, centuries-old heritage was about to be continued for a further year.Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Craig Monks led by example as he cast the Burgh Flag with precision and perfect timing.To the tune that every Selkirk child has grown up with, Up Wirsquo the Souters, each of his fellow Standard Bearers, representing the townrsquos ancient incorporations, also showed that they have perfected this time-served craft.Aaron McColm showed no nerves as he allowed the Hammermenrsquos Flag to flutter in the gentle breeze before casting with authority.Darren Miller, son of Provost Keith, made sure his family and his Weavers corporation would be proud with another perfectly timed cast.Marc Spencersquos smile was proof enough of his fine job with the Fleshersrsquo Standard.Bruce Riddell has previously watched his brother, Kieran, cast both the Hammermenrsquos and the Royal Burgh flags in recent years.And he was equal to his siblingrsquos faultless casts with the Merchant Company flag.Bruce later told us: ldquoEvery second of the practices and doing the actual cast itself has been amazing.ldquoIrsquove watched my brother doing it, and my father has told me about his time as Standard Bearer, but nothing they said could have prepared for me that today ndash it was unbelievable.Stuart Smith had flown in from Florida to cast the Colonial Flag with perfection.And concluding the memorable morning ceremony was Justin Gilchrist for the Ex-Soldiersrsquo Association.The former Royal Signals operator from Paisley only moved to Selkirk four years ago ndash but the signicance of the occasion wasnrsquot lost on him.He said: ldquoMy we, Fiona, is from Selkirk so I knew all about the Common Riding long before I moved to the town.ldquoI joined the Ex-Soldiersrsquo Association as soon as I moved here and Irsquove wanted to be Standard Bearer for a while now.ldquoIt was really emotional up there ndash it far exceeded all expectations.Asby arrangement, just seconds after the conclusion to the ceremony with the Royal Burgh Flag ed to Provost Keith Miller, the heavens suddenly opened.For Provost Miller, who was serving his first of three

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack.

These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-musselburgh-gala-2019","story":"Organised by Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, the fun-packed event is adored by youngsters in the Honest Toun.From noon until pm, there is a range of activities on offer including shows, quad bikes, face painting and dance displays.Edinburgh magician Alexander the Great will enthral gala visitors with his magic and circus skills show and Dinky Donuts will be present to keep those hunger pangs at bay.East Coast FM lead the fun and games as compegraveres.Also present will be Musselburghrsquos Army Cadets, Air Cadets and Sea Cadets, with musical entertainment provided by the Penicuik and Musselburgh Boysrsquo Brigade Pipe Band.Representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership will also be on hand to discuss its work with the local community.The Brunton Bistro serves tea, coffee, sandwiches and pies in a marquee.For those who prefer a snack as they enjoy the many activities, Sizzlers are selling food such as burgers, bacon rolls and chips.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match. Frequency should be half-hourly.Councillor Tom Trotter, who represents Haddington, backed the station bid.He said: ldquoIt is a good idea, especially with the town expanding as it is.ldquoIt would be a tremendous asset to have.However, the councillor felt it was more likely the station would have to find a new site, such as Alderston, to the north of the town.He added: ldquoIn the short-term it is unrealistic, but hopefully in the longer term things can be put in place to make it a realistic possibility.ldquoIt is a great idea and Irsquom sure it would get support from all the local ward councillors, but where it would go and how much it would cost are questions."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-prestonpans-gala-2019","story":"This year is the th anniversary of Prestonpans Childrenrsquos Gala.On gala day itself, the festivities kick off with the crowning ceremony at am at Prestonpans Community Centre.There is then a fancy-dress competition at Middleshot Square at noon before the parade heads off through the town.From Middleshot Square, it heads along Hawthorn Road and down West Loan to the war memorial, then along High Street before turning up Redburn Road, then along North Grange Avenue, where it ends at Mary Murray Park, behind the community centre.The park hosts the gala dayrsquos family fun, which includes a funfair with a host of rides, as well as old favourites such as hook the duck.There is also a vintage fire engine on display, as well as an American police car, motorbike displays, ponies, birds of prey, beat the goalie, Zorbs, safe archery, NERF guns, crazy golf, a tombola and a gala raffle, not to mention ice cream vans, tea and coffee, Mr Donut Man, crepes, waffles, hot dogs, nachos, a burger van, La Favorita pizzas, stalls selling gts, sweets and cake.Gala day marks the beginning, not the end of Prestonpansrsquo week of fun and activities.Events are as follows:Saturday, June Monday, June Tuesday, June Wednesday, June Thursday, June Friday, June "},{"url":null,"title":"bid-to-turn-former-rbs-in-north-berwick-into-a-house","story":"The townrsquos Royal Bank of Scotlandclosed in June last year.

Instead, with bemusement, it has had to look on as the Tories go through their labyrinthine procedures to elect a new leader and, meanwhile, the UK is without a Prime Minister with any real authority. If our politicians keep this up, the Conservative and Labour parties are unlikely to avoid another firm spanking from the electorate when the voters are given the chance to record their views at a General Election.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.JEREMY Hunt calls for live public debates between Boris Johnson and himself before, wait for it, the Tory Party members vote.This matter is now an internal Tory party issue. The general public has no vote, ergo the Tories should look to another means to reach out to their members.They should call an extraordinary party congress run by themselves and hold it in camera. That would spare us all having to listen. The two candidates can address their members there, answer questions from the floor and sell their programme and contact each member by a prospectus and release a copy to the press. Simple.The last thing the public need at this stage is for money from the public broadcaster to assist this internal party stramash!John Edgar, Kilmaurs.RUTH Marr has, predictably, laid into Boris Johnson when he has not even won yet . This attitude is derived from the Nicola Sturgeon \"charm\" book which is to take the worst possible statistics and use them as a political weapon. Examples being the \" per cent\" of Scots voting to remain in  which does not take into account the total number of potential voters and the claim that \"up to , jobs will be lost\" due to a hard Brexit. which is essentially meaningless.What Scotland actually cannot afford is independence and for a very cogent reason. It seems to have been forgotten that part of the reason for Brexit was that the UK economy was paying in far more to Brussels than we got out. Conversely, Scotland was awarded a larger share of this money. If Scotland were independent, and wanted to rejoin the European Union, we would be asked to contribute more than we get out because Nicola Sturgeon has emphasised just how \"wealthy\" Scotland really is. The SNP will find EU membership is a much harder sell back here. What then Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.IrsquoM a wee bit fed up of hearing the claim, expressed on your Letters Pages , that remain supporters in the Scottish independence debate are a ldquosilent majority.In the  referendum, there were very strong feelings on both sides, strongly and eloquently expressed on both sides. The Unionist cause had erstwhile Chancellor, Alistair Darling, and the big beast that is Gordon Brown speaking on its behalf. Blair McDougall, chief strategist for Remain, appeared frequently on BBC and STV chat shows, and the darling of the Conservative Party, Ruth Davison, after  touted as a possible Prime Minister ,was much photographed and much quoted. Celebrity endorsements from figures as erse as Sir David Attenborough and Eddie Izzard also received maximum publicity. In homes and colleges and cafes and pubs all over Scotland, debate raged, both sides making their case with equal passion.Itrsquos a moot point whether in Scotland Unionists are still a majority, but they are most certainly not silent.Angus Ferguson, Glasgow G."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-of-the-day-how-is-scotland-doing-on-its-climate-change-promises","story":"But a lot can change in a decade.

Transport emissions increased by .% between  and , mainly due to an increase in emissions from road transport.In fact, while transport emissions as a whole have increased by .% between  and , road transport emissions have increased by .%. This is due to a growth in activity over the period offset partly by improvements in the efficiency of vehicles.To put these figures in context, we are living and working in a time that is post declaration of a climate change emergency. Our government has reacted by committing to Scotland becoming net-zero emissions by .These statistics are entirely unacceptable.Ralph Roberts is Vice Chair of CPT ScotlandAs citizens of Scotland we all need to play our part and consider carefully how we expect to travel, heat our homes and generally consume. Meanwhile, our political leaders need to be prepared to make brave decisions and re-evaluate how transport is funded and delivered.Within this evaluation public transport ndash particularly by bus ndash has to be at the forefront of our thinking. Not as a problem to tackle but as a solution to embrace.Buses are the first target for Scotlandrsquos LEZs. They are among the biggest vehicles on the road. They must be to blame.In fact, buses are responsible for % of greenhouse gas emissions from road transportand the sector is investing heavily to further reduce that figure. Indeed, % of the UK bus fleet is zero emission already.The case for bus use is even stronger when you consider emissions on a per passenger basis. One full bus can replace  cars on the road.Cities that prioritise buses, cycling and walking reap societal benefits in terms of improvements in health, inclusion, accessibility. Research suggests that every pound invested in bus priority measures generates up to pound in wider benefits. Investing in bus transport is also good for the local economy. Cities such as Utrecht and Copenhagen, with their progressive sustainable transport focus, have disproved the myth that the car is vital for the high street.It is already the case more people access Scotlandrsquos town centres by bus than any other mode and spend pound per trip on average.However, bus use is falling as our road network becomes ever more congested. Many of these lost journeys will be people reverting to cars. Reversing this trend ndash thereby reducing road transport related emissions and capturing the benefits of bus growth ndash should be a priority for our policy makers. is a reasonable distance away but work to accomplish this has to start nowwe hope to change the national mindset.A paradigm sht is required.We need to introduce an evolution of the narrative around how we should expect to use our road space. This should be driven by central government and cascaded to local communities.Once the narrative takes hold, the introduction of the changes required becomes a much less contentious issue. The introduction of the smoking ban following the Smoking, Health and Social CareAct  is an example of how this approach can succeed.With regards to transport, government should invest in infrastructure that prioritises sustainable and active modes. Make walking, cycling and bus all viable and attractive options before restricting car use.Sweden recently added two words to the national vocabulary: flygskamand taringgskry . These encapsulate the recognition on the environment of our travel choices.I do not want to endorse environmental shaming but can we all really justy every car trip we take  Taking the bus should be a badge of pride.To its credit, the Scottish government is investing heavily on the rail network to lower emissions and improve journey times. Now is the time to similarly invest in bus infrastructure, particularly given that % of all public transport trips in Scotland are taken by busDirect public investment towards those that are making choices in line with Government policy on climate change. If this really is a climate emergency, we need to see a change in thinking and that starts at the top.Ralph Roberts is Vice Chair of CPT Scotland"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10033875.jpg?type=article-full","title":"john-prescott-tony-blairs-bruiser","story":"John Prescott, who has suffered a stroke, was one of the most recognisable politicians following labours landslide election win in , serving as deputy Prime Minister until .: John Prescott suffers strokeHis gruff, northern delivery was also a gt to satirists who mocked his occasionally mangled syntax and poor grammar.Prescott in Born in Prestatyn, Wales n , he was the MP for Hull East for  years from  to , and was forever associated with the north of England town.Starting out in in the Merchant navy as a waiter and steward on a Cunard liner, he was introduced to left-wing politics and trade union activism and left to pursue further education at Ruskin College and later the University of Hull.During his time in government he was for four years Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions - a massive portfolio which saw him butting heads with rail franchise owners due to his longstanding opposition to privatisation, although it was not reversed.:Prescott goes north to put his weight behind the No campaign#He was also instrumental in the UKs part in the drawing up of the Kyoto protocols to cut greenhouse gases, although his stated attempts to cut car use in favour of public transport failed.Prescotts time as environment secretary also saw one of the biggest faux pas, when he and we Pauline were caught out by the newspapers being driven  yards from their hotel to the venue of the Labour Party Conference.His reply to questions on the subject - that his we didnt like to get her hair blown about by the wind - led to widespread mockery and earned the MP the nickname \"Two Jags\" .On the campaign trail with we Pauline .Attempts to reform local government in England also floundered when he tried to bring in Regional Assemblies for the North.

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm. There#s no need to book — just look for the Good Egg rep in the Tesco foyer, or head for the red fire engine.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They want to hear from the owners of all kinds of properties, from urban studio flats to historic country piles. From Shetland to Stranraer and Orkney to Oban, prime properties from all over Scotland will be in the frame.Jo Street, commissioner for BBC Scotland, said: “We’re delighted to announce a second series of Scotland’s Home of the Year. It isn’t just about showing off million-pound properties – it’s about truly celebrating what people have done to turn their house into a home, expressing their iniduality through their design, flair and imagination. We saw some cracking houses over the course of series one and there are far more gems to uncover for series two.”The first series of Scotland’s Home of the Year was broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel in April and May this year.The series has since seen its audience continue to grow on iPlayer with requests to view so far hitting more than a quarter of a million – ,.The format saw three judges – architect Michael Angus, interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and lestyle blogger Kate Spiers – travel theand breadth of Scotland to discover architectural gems and unearth some stunning interiors. Both traditional and contemporary properties were put under the microscope and judges considered everything from a one-bedroom apartment to a centuries-old country castle … and everything in between.Each home was scored on ality, distinctiveness and clever design and from seven finalists, one clear winner of series one was chosen – the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, created by proud owner Lesley Smith and her late husband Mike.Series two will have a slightly longer run than series one with nine -minute heats, each featuring three properties from a specic part of the country. The  houses featured will then be whittled down to a final nine which will go under the spotlight in an hour-long final episode.Gerard Costello, executive producer, IWC Media said: “We are thrilled that Scotland’s Home of the Year is ing to the BBC Scotland channel. The first series was a joy to make and we have only scratched the surface of the beautul and distinctive homes Scotland has to offer. We can’t wait to get started.”If you’d like to be considered for the next series of Scotland’s Home of the Year, you can get in touch at scotlandshomes@IWCMedia copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Providing practical training for riders where they can improve their skills and understanding of risks through controlled exercises is a vital part of this strategy.“Motorcyclists are vastly over-represented in serious road injuries, so I hope that Orkney’s motorcyclists will take up this opportunity to both become a safer road user and improve their overall riding experience through better bike handling skills.”Anyone interested in attending the course should email: operationriderrefinement@scotland.pnn.police.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate.

Admirers of the high art of comedy may be familiar with an especially brilliant sketch written and performed by David Mitchell and Robert Webb. The pair – dressed in Germany army unorms – are on a World War Two battlefield, preparing an attack. Webb’s character, puffed up and confident, puts down a field telephone, and declares, “They’re coming. Now we’ll see how these Russians deal with a crack SS ision.”As distant gunfire echoes, Mitchell’s character approaches, nervously clears his throat, and begins, “Hans…”“Have courage, my friend,” says Webb’s alpha.“Yeah, eh, Hans, I’ve just noticed something,” comes the reply.“These communists are all cowards.”“Have you looked out our caps, recently ” asks Mitchell’s beta.“Our caps ”“The badges on our caps, have you looked at them ”“What  No… a bit.”With an anguished look on his face, Mitchell’s character continues, “They’ve got skulls on them. Have you noticed that our caps have actually got little pictures of skulls on them ”“I don’t, um…”“Hans,” Mitchell’s soldier continues, tentatively, “…are we the baddies ”There is more to come and I urge you,you haven’t seen it, to seek out the sketch, online. It is masterful stuff that endures almost  years after it was first broadcast on the double act’s BBC Two sketch show.Perhaps what makes this sketch so timeless, beyond the excellence of the performances, is that it captures something with which we can all identy. Which of us hasn’t, at some crucial point in our lives, been stricken by a moment of crushing self-doubt  Which of us hasn’t wondered whether, maybe, we are in the wrong I watched the sketch again last week and it occurred to me that it could not be more relevant, right now.Self-examination has never been so unfashionable uncertainty is a weakness to be deplored . Among the political classes, absolute certainty must be maintained, even in the face of crushing evidence that destroys one’s assertions.Think of the bluster of former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, who led the war against nuance during ’s independence referendum campaign. Any dficult question about how he might oversee the break-up of the UK was dismissed by Salmond as part of a “Project Fear” campaign designed to terry voters who might not have believed independence to be in Scotland’s best interests. Salmond’s aggressive reaction to legitimate inquiry created a culture in the Yes campaign where the done thing was not to consider the question but to question the motives of the questioner. After all, since we could be certain that independence would be a very good thing with no downsides, anyone who suggested otherwise must have had malice in their hearts. Of course Scotland would retain its EU membership after voting Yes, insisted Salmond, in the face of remarks from the EU that contradicted him. Of course an independent Scotland would enter into a currency union with what was left of the UK, despite assurances from the then chancellor and his Westminster shadows that no such arrangement would or could take place. Of course Scotland, standing proudly alone, would be wealthy and prosperous, even though the price of North Sea oil – on which this assertion was based – was plummeting.This absolute certainty infected the Yes campaign which, often, mistook angry shouting for debate and went on to discover that it needed more than blind faith to persuade a majority of Scots to support the independence project.A year later, as Donald Trump ramped up his campaign to become American President, dangerous certainty reached a new, even more disturbing level. Evidence of Trump’s misdeeds – things like film and audio recordings and paperwork that, by any standard, proved he was unsuitable for the role he sought – was rejected by the candidate as “fake news” and his supporters, so utterly convinced that Trump would make good on his promise to “make America great again”, accepted his words as truth. To question Trump’s claims was to be a traitor.And in , the same characterisation of doubt as weakness proved invaluable to Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson as they bluffed their way to victory in the referendum on EU membership. Their every proclamation about “freedom” and “sovereignty” was accepted, without question, by their disciples. Self-reflection can be a painful business it’s hardly surprising that we are so uncomfortable about doing it. It’s so much easier to blame a former partner for the break down of a relationship than it is to consider whether our own behaviour might have played its part. It’s comforting to think that we missed out on a promotion because the interviewer had it in for us rather than because, maybe, another candidate was better suited. Over recent weeks, we’ve listened as contenders to become the next leader of the Conservative Party and, by extension, Prime Minister of the UK, have set out their “plans” to achieve Brexit where Theresa May failed. With the honourable exception of Rory Stewart, whose decision to engage with reality rather than to rely on fantasy ruled him wholly unsuitable for the \u2028job, these men relied on loud declarations of certainty to maintain their campaigns.The final two candidates – Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt– are still at it. They’re still telling us they can get a new deal out of the EU, even as the EU insists the withdrawal agreement struck with Theresa May is the only one available.Hunt and Johnson – or, more accurately, the parade of lickspittle MPs who have appeared in the media in his stead while he hides from scrutiny –continue to assert, with bullet-proofed certainty, that they have plans to make a success of Brexit when all the evidence says that they damned well do not.The certainty of politicians comes with a large dollop of nauseating moral superiority on top.

Only delivering Brexit on  October cannormality to British politicsExactly three years ago this morning I walked out of Milbank Tower, Westminster, after an all-night party arranged to take in the results of the UK’s EU referendum.I had a smile as bright as the dawn and wide as the Thames itself. We had only gone and done it the campaign to leave the European Union had blown the bloody doors off. British politics would never be the same again.I was always confident about the outcome of the referendum and repeatedly cheered-up my less optimistic colleagues that they were in the process of making history. Although behind in the polls for most of the campaign the cross-party and non-party coalition of Leave supporters had at least three advantages that gave us an underlying edge. The first was Prime Minister David Cameron had been poorly treated by the European Union’s political elite who stupidly dismissed his attempt to show he could win reforms. This was a serious political misjudgement by Merkel, Hollande, Juncker, Tusk and their aloof colleagues, displaying a symptomatic arrogance and condescension that continues to this day. Had they conceded deliverable reforms demonstrating a willingness to decentralise and loosen their inexorable drive towards ever closer union then the Leave campaign would have had a far harder fight on its hands.• : Nicola Sturgeon: Chances of no Brexit now more likelyAlthough Cameron’s shuttle diplomacy is mostly forgotten now its repudiation set the context in which the referendum would be played out – the British looking for the repatriation for more controlsagainst a European establishment who had stopped listening and paid only lip-service to keep troublesome natives docile.The second advantage was that there was not one campaign to Leave – but many. While Vote Leave eventually won the official designation to run the Leave campaign the competition to win the designation that came first from Leave.EUand latterly from Grassroots Out, meant there was not one strategy reaching out to voters but three. In addition, a long list of dedicated groups that had been campaigning for at least a generation, such as The Freedom Association, Bruges Group and Global Britain had been joined by the likes of Labour Leave to reach out to people that might otherwise have fallen off a centralised campaign grid. Together with UKIP members – a party originally founded by the Scot Professor Alan Sked in response to the Maastricht Treaty, and then made politically successful by Nigel Farage – they also provided boots on the ground that were willing to work with the many Conservatives who took the brave pills and opposed their leader and Prime Minister.It is thanks to the happenstance of this hydra-headed approach that the Leave result was achieved despite the official campaign, rather than because of it.• : Brexit deal is dead: Prepare for No Deal vs No Brexit – Brian WilsonThe third advantage was the solely negative approach taken by the Remain group, which learned nothing from the almost fatal negativity of the Better Together campaign in the Scottish referendum. After dropping any mention of Cameron’s fudged and worthless reforms George Osborne, Nick Clegg, George Carney and their lieutenants relied upon a constant feed of scaremongering and doom-laden reports, forecasts and supercharged extrapolations of unreliable predictions to frighten voters of what might come – not just in the future but “immediately following” a vote to leave. Just as many of the similar threats did not cut through in the Scottish referendum they failed dismally to motivate support for the European project that had been the common purpose of the global political elite and their civil servants since the Second World War. Even rolling out President Obama worked against British pugnaciousness. Most economic threats were seen as out of touch and simply not believed, but where they might have ben effective were still dismissed as irrelevant – people wanted control of their lives back. That is why cities such as Sunderland and Derby with their Nissan and Toyota car plants, or Redcar with its closing steel mill, still voted Leave – and still support it today.That the UK should go on to create over , new jobs in the following three years and maintain its lead in attracting Foreign Direct Investment ahead of Germany and Francedemonstrated who really lied in the referendum. Nor should we forget the Remain campaign outspent the Leave campaign by £.m to .m not counting the Government’s own pamphlet that cost £.m to print and distribute to m households before expenses rules kicked-in. The result was determined not by money but by having messages that chimed with what ious voters thought.The fallout since that day three years ago has been immense.Cameron broke his promise to stay only for another remainer, Theresa May, to replace him unchallenged. Her litany of broken promises are well recorded and I offer no sympathy for it must be understood, she dealt her own hand and then played it badly. It was she who relegated her government from a working majority to an imploding minority she who chose the strategy of repeated concessions over the advice of her ministers tasked with the negotiations and she who refused to listen when confronted with defeat, after defeat, after defeat.Instead of capitalising on the Conservative failure Jeremy Corbyn has preicated so often that Labour politicians compete to claim which direction he faces– Leave or Remain, second referendum or general election  Likewise the SNP has become trapped in the Leave headlights, fooling itself that Brexit can deliver independence rather than seeking to deliver a successful government.Having retired, believing his job was done, Nigel Farage has come back and formed the Brexit Party which has earned him the plaudit of bringing down two prime ministers without him even being in the House of Commons. Now he must hold the feet of Boris Johnson orJeremy Hunt to the fire. Farage has identied what the British people have been saying for years – our political leaders cannot be trusted – and it is a rich seam to be mined. The EU referendum has reset British politics. If Labour turns its back on leave voters it will lose seats in the North. If the Tories don’t deliver Brexit by  October they will lose seats wholesale. Only once the referendum result is delivered in a form recognisable to its supporters can politics be reset again, by which time it may well be unrecognisable.• Brian Monteith is an MEP-elect for the Brexit Party©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish independence holyrood must control future vote says council leader","story":"Holding a future independence referendum should be under the control of the Scottish Parliament, according to the leader of Glasgow City Council.In a motion lodged at the local authority ahead of a meeting on Thursday, the SNPs Susan Aitken will urge councillors to back her call for Holyrood to have authority over the referendum process.Ms Aitken will also ask councillors to support her in writing to the Scottish Governments Constitutional Relations Secretary, Mike Russell, in support of principles which include the referendum is held \"in line with establishedbest practice\".• : Nicola Sturgeon absolutely confident Scots are ready to vote for independenceIn her motion, Ms Aitken states: \"Council welcomes the publication of the ReferendumsBill on May  and notes that it is expected to complete its parliamentary progress by the end of .\"Council notes that the Bill provides a legal framework for holding referendums on matters that are now, or in future, within the competence of the Scottish Parliament.\"It continues: \"Council recognises that, as Scotland is dragged towards the exit door of the EU by a Conservative Government for which we did not vote, and that the promises made by the No Campaign in the  independence referendum lie in tatters, citizens in Glasgow and across Scotland are entitled to exercise their right to reject this future through a further referendum on independence.\"Council agrees that a future independence referendum should be under the control of the Scottish Parliament and, under the guidance of the ElectoralCommission, be fair and open, in line with established best practice, and command public confidence, and instructs the Leader of the Council to write to the Cabinet Secretary for Government Business and Constitutional Relations in support of these principles and of the aims of the ReferendumsBill.\"As well as outlining her support for an independence referendum to be controlled by Holyrood, Ms Aitken also notes Scotlands  per cent Remain vote in the EU referendum of  and states concern over Tory leadership candidates who have outlined plans to leave the EU without a deal.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned - SallyFatal road crash: Our hearts and prayers are with family, says MP Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"outdoors consultation","story":"MEA Council is planning to grow its provision for outdoor recreation over the next decade and want to hear what residents would or wouldn#t like to see happen in the borough.Outdoor recreation covers everything from clay pigeon shooting to walks, cycling, climbing, running and more.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth. Lady Gorman, passed away peacefully in Ringdufferin Nursing Home in .

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

He told the : “This has been an ongoing campaign for me and my constituents who use this Junction sometimes on a daily basis .“ I first contacted DFI Roads some years ago in September  when they told me that due to recent collisions an investigation was under way. “They also informed me at that time they had a scheme proposal under development with a number of options being considered. “Writing back to them a year later in  DFI Roads then stated they hoped to be in a position to compete for funding in the next three years works programme which was being developed at the time. “By  we then managed to convince DFI Roads to put in place a number of additional measures at the junction. “New Junction warning signs and Slow markings were provided along with new enhanced signage on the Woodtown Rd.”Mr. Frew said that DFI Roads are now proposing to spend pound, on upgrading the junction although he did not specy an actual timeline of when the work will take place. He added: “ The primary aim is to change the junction priority from Woodtown Rd to Sand Rd to accommodate the predominant traffic movements. “This will also improve stopping sight distances throughout the approaches.

In a specially commissioned visual, the iconic clfs of Fairhead in County Antrim have been digitally transformed into an eye-catching sculpture featuring the images of local golfing greats, past and present. Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, who will all now be competing in the tournament, feature in the design, alongside former Open Champion and Portrush man Fred Daly. Engaging the talents of Hollywood digital CGI artist Mike Campau, the tongue-in-cheek stunt has been designed to reflect how Northern is truly ‘Made for Golf’, illustrated not only by our sporting talents but also in our landscapes and rugged coast. The timing of the tribute could not be more fitting as Northern Ireland golfers celebrate their recent triumphs on the course, with Rory McIlroy winning the Canadian Open by seven shots to secure his th PGA Tour title and fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowellafter finishing tied eighth on  under.

Tourism NI Marketing Director Naomi Waite said: “With ‘Open fever’ beginning to take a hold, we wanted to honour the global golfing heroes who collectively have played a key role in bringing The th Open to Northern Ireland and, through their talent, have made Northern Ireland a growing international golf destination. It is just one of many activities we have planned to celebrate the enormous pride that the people of Northern Ireland have in the achievements of our golfing greats. “While Northern Ireland might one day boast its own ‘Mount Rushmore’ for golf, we can reassure everyone that this stunt is digital theatre and something we hope will raise a smile ahead of July.” Robin Daly, son of the late Fred Daly, said: “Our family are extremely honoured that my father is being remembered in this way. We are really looking forward to theof The Open to our shores for the first time in nearly  years and this sculpture is a wonderful tribute to the talents of these local sportspeople who have earned their place in the history book of golf.” McIlroy and McDowell will tee up at Royal Portrush alongside fellow local and former Open Champion, Darren Clarke, in front of a passionate home crowd when one of the world’s greatest sporting spectacles - The Open - s to the famous Dunluce links for the first time in nearly  years.

Parishioners and well-wishers packed into Corpus Christi Church for am Mass as the Springhill congregation came together to give thanks for Fr Des’ dedicated service to the West Belfast community.Parish Priest of Corpus Christi Fr Paddy McCafferty, who celebrated the special service, praised Fr Des’ “immense strength and dedication” within and to the community and said the depths of gratitude felt towards him are “immeasurable.” “Fr Des is a champion of the people, Fr Des saw was needed to be done and did it, he is a man without equal.”“Fr Des co-ordinated, instigated and educated the community. I’m almost lost for words when it comes to describing him. I was looking up the meaning of the word ‘platinum’, it means hard wearing, hard, Fr Des was rock hard in his work for the community. What would people have done without him ”On celebrating his Platinum Jubilee Fr Des said: “I never thought I would get this far.“There were more than  priests ordained the same day as I was, most of them are gone from this world, a mere handful of us laughing about which of us will reach the th birthday first.“What I want to do now, most of all is to thank God for allowing me to live among such good family, friends and neighbours during those years. You taught me what le means you taught me that especially during the bad, sad times. I believe we are seeing the beginning of a renewed Ireland, a renewed Christianity, a renewed city of Belfast – and we are privileged to live in one of the most beautul parts of the city – between the beautul mountain that is full of surprises like the feast of bluebells in the beginning of summer to the snow topped hills in winter, between the sweeping magnicent valley of the Lough and the Lagan,” he said. “This must surely be one of the most beautul places for a city to be in.”Fr Des continued: “This is where I learned the best lessons about le and I am grateful to family, friends, neighbours who taught me and even had great patience when I learned so slowly. I learned how good people show their dignity even during the hardest of times, show it most of all during the hard times. “So I am grateful to God for being here, grateful, to all whom I have had the privilege of being family and neighbour to. And very, very hopeful for the future.“Coming out of the worst of times we could now be facing into the best of times. May God and good people make it so. Father Paddy, like our friend Father Aiden, you are with us all at the beginning of a newly awakened Church and a people refreshed by what they have suffered and achieved together. We have good reason to be thankful for that and for each other.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from detroit to north belfast how a big name does a big job","story":"TO say the name Kronk Boxing Gym is iconic in the sport would be an understatement. Located in Detroit and once led by trainer Emanuel Steward, the name is a household word in the sport of boxing.But North Belfast has its a Kronk Boxing Gym, located in the Duncairn Centre on Duncairn Avenue.Formed as Belfast ABC over  years ago by Bobby McAllister, one of the best coaches in Ireland at the time, the club has come a long way since.In December , former secretary of the gym, Damien McCann, played a pivotal role in Limerick boxer Andy Lee turning pro. He then negotiated a lucrative financial management agreement for Lee to turn professional with Emanuel Steward from the world renowned Detroit Kronk Boxing GymLee was Ireland’s rising amateur boxing star and when he beat USA champion, Jesus Gonzales in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championship, a new relationship between Steward and Kronk in Detroit was born with Belfast ABC gym, hence its name today, Kronk ABC Belfast.Past professional coach Tony Dunlop has been a key figure throughout the history of Kronk ABC Belfast and spoke about the club’s illustrious time.“This place started over  years ago when Bobby McAllister walked past the building which was derelict at the time and thought it would be perfect place for a boxing gym,” he explained.“He asked people in the community who were very positive and said that it would be great for young people in the area.“After a period of time, a lot of kids came through the doors. Ryan Burnettt and Paddy Barnes both started off here.“Burnett was groomed from his early days in here to become a superstar. He left here at  fights undefeated and was one of the best in the world at just  years old.“The turning point I suppose was when Emanuel Steward from Kronk gym in Detroit, which is the best gym in the history of boxing, got in touch.“He saw some of the work we were doing and Belfast Kronk Boxing Gym was born –the rest is history as they say.“We have continued to bring through a lot of champions including professionals James Tennyson and Daniel McShane.“Tommy McCarthy is also here now fighting professional.”Today, the club is going from strength to strength under the stewardship of a new breed of coaches in the shape of Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough.The duo have embarked on a new programme of coaching young people from North Belfast with the aim of using boxing to their benefit.Tony added: “Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough are both fantastic coaches. They are flying the flag for Belfast Kronk Gym today.“They have started off a new programme with the youth of the area. They are both giving it a million per cent. I’ve never seen two coaches work as hard. Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do. They don’t miss classes.“If we get a few champions out of it, then brilliant, but it is for the kids.“Most boxing clubs don’t take kids at eight years old, but we do.“All the kids start off exercising and running about the big hall before they come into the boxing gym itself.“They are putting their energy into something positive instead of being on the street and engaging in vandalism and anti-social behaviour. I believe there is a bright future for boxing in North Belfast. We have a top-class facility and there are a lot of good kids in here.”To find out more about the club and to get involved, check out the new Kronk ABC Belfast Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local mla gets brexit safety alert","story":"POLICE have delivered an extraordinary advice list to the West Belfast home of a Sinn Féin MLA suggesting ways in which he can improve his and his family’s personal security post-Brexit.The document has already been delivered to the homes of all  MPs across the United Kingdom, but officers who called to the home of Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said they are widening distribution of the document to take in Brexit spokespersons of parties in the north. The leaflet – headlined ‘When It Goes Too Far’ – outlines steps that politicians should takethey are targeted by extremists in any wave of public unrest that may break out post-October , the latest deadline for the UK leaving the EU.The document – which Mr Ó Muilleoir yesterday branded “Brexit bollox – has been compiled by a number of UK agencies: the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, the College of Policing and the Electoral Commission. Despite its wide experience in dealing with public unrest, the PSNI has not been involved in drawing up the guidelines. But local police officers have been tasked with distributing it to MLAs closely connected to the Brexit issue.To the fore in the security advice is what Mr Ó Muilleoir and his family should do in the event of being targeted with a hazardous substance. Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue. There’s little in this that isn’t already known to most people and no reason why it couldn’t have been emailed to me rather than dispatching a police patrol. There are Catholic families in my South Belfast constituency living under the jackboot of the UVF and the flegger bully-boys. The PSNI would be better advised to protect those folk rather than wasting their time and my time with this Brexit bollox.”"},{"url":null,"title":"9000 in northern ireland apply to secure status after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

https:t.co QZTQcoK— Prosperity-UKJune , Its interim report recommends:– Investigating the possibility of creating special economic zones to cover the border.– Creating a multi-tier trusted trader programme for large and medium-sized companies, with exemptions for the smallest firms.– Using mobile units to carry out sanitary and phytosanitarychecks – covering food safety and plant and animal health – away from the border.– Drafting an alternative arrangements protocol which could be inserted into either the Withdrawal Agreement or used in any other Brexit outcome.The commission was chaired by Tory former ministers Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands.Treasury Select Committee chairwoman Mrs Morgan said: “The commission has met its three conditions: to uphold the vital Belfast-Good Friday Agreement to harness existing technologies and customs best practice, not any futuristic high-tech unicorns and to be compatible with any of the possible Brexit outcomes, including the existing Withdrawal Agreement.“A successful agreement and roll-out of alternative arrangements would supersede the need for the backstop.”But Owen Smith, former shadow Northern Ireland secretary and a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said: “The idea of trying to replace the Northern Ireland backstop with so-called alternative arrangements has already been tested to destruction.“There is no political will to do so from either Ireland, the rest of the EU or most importantly the people of Northern Ireland, particularly those living on or near the border.”He said the commission was “a desperate attempt to make a square peg fit into a round hole in order to try and hold the warring factions of the Conservative Party together”.Naomi Smith, head of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said “a solution years down the line won’t cut it: we have a deadline of October  this year” and the proposals would “wrap the island of Ireland in red tape and bureaucracy – at a hefty cost to the British taxpayer”.“A quicker, cheaper and more efficient option would be to stop Brexit,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar casts doubt on alternative arrangements plan for irish border","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

of Ireland and Northern Ireland .A new body of experts has been set up in the UK to look at potential alternative arrangements.Read MoreExtent of Irish north-south cooperation revealed in secret Brexit impact mapping exercise reportFuture PM seeking to delay Brexit would face EU hostility – VaradkarExpert  appointed to advise UK government on alternative arrangements for Irish border after BrexitMany Brexiteers believe technological solutions could replace the backstop. But Mr Varadkar said he could not see evidence of arrangements being outlined before the October  deadline for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market.Leo VaradkarThe Taoiseach made the remarks at the end of an EU summit in Brussels as European Council president Donald Tusk said Brexit would become “more exciting” than before with a change of British prime minister but that the EU’s position had not changed.Mr Varadkar said: “We can’t accept that alternative arrangements are an alternative to a backstop unless we can see what these alternative arrangements are, know how they would work and see them demonstrated.“That hasn’t been done yet and I don’t see that being done this side of October  which is why we certainly can’t accept the deletion of the backstop.”He added: “For us, a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no backstop”."},{"url":null,"title":"brexits impact on many crossborder initiatives

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland. The network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist childrens cardiology centre in Belfast, supported by cardiology expertise in local hospitals. There is also cross-border cooperation on organ and tissues transplants. Nineteen areas are linked to the avoiding a hard border objective and include everything from customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures.Current EU rules \"stop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting\". Other less obvious areas mentioned in the report include the operation of cross-border taxis repatriation of waste and cross-border movement of waste, and even the management of Lough Erne eel stocks.It also species areas such as invasive alien species, chemicals regulation and wildfire initiatives.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that in the majority of areas ongoing cross-border cooperation would be addressed by retaining the common travel area and pursuing an agreement on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated, the circumstances are not unique to our province,\" she said.\"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels.

It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,” he said.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.“He is technically wrong on that point which he should know,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum. There was – which they shared with us – on a very small scale, but nevertheless it was there.”He added: “There has been no proper audit done during the referendum. There is certainly evidence of suspicious Russian activity during the referendum and where.”"},{"url":null,"title":"temperatures set to rise above 30c by saturday after wet start to","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas. So, Conor McBride and the rest of the group jumped at the chance and found themselves there last week in advance of the Tyson Fury v Tom Schwarz heavyweight bout.Conor told the Derry News: “While we were in Las Vegas, I had the idea to visit the Mayweather gym as James and myself are both big boxing fans.

So, my coach and GB coaches suggested I give it a go this year. My shoot was what won the event.ldquoI was neck and neck with the previous British champion most of the way round. She would gain on me during the swim and transitions, but I would pull away from her in the shoot and run and luckily managed to keep ahead of her on the last run which involved an incline to the finish, she said.ldquoBy my fourth time up it, this incline felt like Everest, but my training around Stormont Estate had me well conditioned for that. Suzie has an extremely busy summer ahead of her and is so looking forward to the challenges ahead.ldquoMy focus now is Traithle Europeans in June in Madeira, then Worlds in Florida in October.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years.

That is not the norm where in the public sector,\" he said.Dr Farry claimed it would have been \"fairly pointless, futile and counterproductive to proceed with the cap\" in August  and would only have led to a huge rush of claims.He said there was \"not a single thing\" he could have done or not done in terms of the PSNI case, and described talk of a cap at that time as \"a complete and utter red herring.\"He insisted that any attempt to introduce a cap at that time would not have got through the Executive, which he claimed was \"extremely dysal\" and \"a transactional clearing house\".Asked would it not have been common sense to discuss the matter with colleagues in the Executive, particularly the then finance minister, before making a decision on the matter, Dr Farry stressed that people in senior HR roles would have been well aware of the Bear Scotland judgement and its potential implications.Denying a suggestion that he was trying to push blame onto civil servants, Dr Farry said: \"This decision was mine. It was my political judgement that I made in the best interests of Northern Ireland and the public interest.\"Man trapped and seriously injured when wall in Luton building collapses Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He added: \"In terms of my responsibilities, I am happy with the actions which I took. I acted with total integrity and in the public interest in the way I did it.\"On the issue of whether or not the PSNI should appeal the case to the UK Supreme Court, Dr Farry said he was sure the PSNI would be assessing last weeks judgement and will make a decision on it.Askedworkers should claim up to  years of back holiday pay they were legally entitled to, he said: \"I think employers should resolve the issue in terms of their workplaces and come to negotiated settlements with their staff around arrears. Where that doesnt happen I think employees would retain the right to exercise their right to a tribunal.\"Responding to the same question later in the programme, UUP leader Robin Swann said: \"If people are entitled to it legally at this minute in time.

As anticipation builds for next month’s Open at Royal Portrush, the veteran radio and TV presenter visited the host course as well as clubs like Royal Belfast, Royal County Down and the town of St Andrews in Scotland – recognised internationally as the home of golf. Gery Kelly and Bill MontgomeryGerry starts his journey at his home club in Ardglass tracing the beginnings of golf in Ireland and reveals a few surprises as he discovers the relatively unknown Ulster-Scots golfing pioneers who helped establish the sport here.He visits stately homes including Mount Stewart on the shores of Strangford Lough and Grey Abbey House – chatting with Lady Rose Lauritzen and William Montgomery – and travels to St Andrews to explore how the Scots claim to have invented the sport and what part they played in bringing the game across the Irish Sea. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p He also sets out to finally answer the age-old dispute about which club is actually the oldest in Ireland. Gerry, who has been playing golf for over five decades at Ardglass Golf Club, said: “Before I began filming for the programme, despite playing the game for most of my le, I actually knew very little about its history, and that’s a shame because there are few sports with as long and as rich a history. Gery Kelly at St Andrews“The thing that amazed me the most was the fact that golf was played in Scotland in the s and it took over  years before it came here. With all the movement of people between the two countries, that Ulster-Scots connection, why did it take so long for the game to be finally organised here ”Gerry, who has been playing golf since he was a teenager, said: “Golf is a sport you can get easily hooked on. It’s a game for le. I know people still playing in their nineties.“For me it’s not so much now about that standard of golf now.

In a statement, they said: \"With millions of people signing online petitions there is a clear appetite for using digital technology to engage with politics.\"By fusing online engagement opportunities with MPs of all parties the group intends to become a signicant mass movement with , members and  MPs onboard by the end of .\"More United CEO Bess Mayhew said: ldquoPeople see cross-party working as a proxy for trust in politics.\"Thatrsquos why we are delighted Stephen Doughty MP has chosen to be a part of the More United network.\"Now we need to start tackling the important issues being ignored because of Brexit and give a voice to people who want to move Britain forward. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future. It is wonderful that the key features of the original beautully designed building are being preserved and transformed. It feels very appropriate, given my fatherrsquos very high standards and professionalism that The Moorwell is being designed and constructed with the same values. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tradeniiii.jpg","title":"new northern ireland trade alliance formed","story":"Posted on Wednesday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s newest trade body alliance will take its message to Westminster later this year amid the ongoing political vacuum at home and with Brexit on the horizon. Trade NI is an alliance between Hospitality Ulster, headed by Colin Neill, Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, and Retail NI, Glyn Roberts, and aims to represent a wider swathe of Northern Ireland’s private sector amid the “paralysis” surrounding a lack of Executive and therefore a lack of local political voice on the UK’s exit from the EU. The group will take its message to London on September , hosting an event to once again bring together politicians, businesses, stakeholders and the media to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing companies here. The alliance, which has been supported by the likes of Heathrow Airport, Danske Bank and Flybe, outlined its aims at its launch in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, to an audience of business leaders from across Northern Ireland. “Northern Ireland is facing huge economic and political challenges ahead with Brexit, no Assembly, and a rapidly changing global economy,” the group said. “Trade NI will seek to give leadership on behalf of our three sectors and provide new policy solutions to creating a modern local economy.” “The paralysis that has been created with the lack of an Assembly and Executive has developed a situation where very little has been done to address the needs of our sectors or the economy at large. “The sht of power from Stormont to Westminster means that we must press decision makers there to implement policies and make legislative changes that will help grow Northern Ireland. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer. “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “Last year we held a NI business reception with over  people that brought together the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, MPs, lords, ministers and key political influencers in Westminster to bring focus to Northern Ireland issues.” “This was a great opportunity to be able to discuss the key concerns of the business community with national political decision makers and help them understand the priorities needed for Northern Ireland, and to promote Northern Ireland as a great place in the United Kingdom to locate or start a business.” Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, the main sponsor of Trade NI’s forthcoming Westminster reception, said that “Northern Ireland has a strong business community and should be considered across the United Kingdom as a thriving business hub for the global market”. “The vitality of the private sector is imperative to the strength of the Northern Ireland economy. We must ensure Northern Ireland businesses are well positioned to be able to compete in the post-Brexit environment. We will continue to work alongside the Trade NI alliance and other key influencers to make sure that Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, remains a key priority at Westminster.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
