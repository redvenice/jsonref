Lord Wolfson, the Brexiteer boss of Next, says he\u0027s seen no evidence Brexit uncertainty is affecting consumer behaviourOn a wider level, Mr Hammond\u0027s Spring Statement last week showed that, as a result of the remarkable improvement in public finances, the Treasury potentially has as much as £26 billion to pump into public services. Indeed, if no deal with Brussels could be achieved, the Government could also start to reallocate the £39 billion exit bill due to be paid to the EU over a number of years.ResourcesThe officials working on Kingfisher would try to make sure harder-pressed parts of the UK had sufficient resources and that small businesses, the backbone of our economy, had access to special support schemes, should trade slump.This is not just a domestic project. Brexit\u0027s potential impact on the economy has been modelled by several international organisations. The IMF has found that, under an EU exit deal similar to the one twice voted down by MPs, the long-term loss of output would be limited to 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent over a decade.It predicts that a No Deal Brexit could cost between 5 and 8 per cent over the same period — alarmingly, double the potential harm.Nevertheless, the Bank of England has been confident enough to raise its economic forecasts on the basis of recent good statistics and expects a strong pick-up in investment if Brexit uncertainty is removed.SpiritIndeed, Mr Carney told the Mail earlier this month that he \u0027has our back\u0027 and is ready to step in if there is disruption.Of course, there are still doom-mongers. A most unusual joint letter from the general secretaries of business organisation, the CBI, and the trades union federation, the TUC, has warned \u0027our country is facing an emergency\u0027 and that firms and communities are unprepared for No Deal.However, this chilling warning is not shared across the whole business community.Lord Wolfson, the Brexiteer boss of Next, says he\u0027s seen no evidence Brexit uncertainty is affecting consumer behaviour.Grocery bosses are less sanguine and warn of dire consequences, not least the soaring cost of food basics from butter to oranges.However, a chairman of two FTSE 100 companies told me yesterday that what he considers to be a \u0027confected panic\u0027 reminded him of fears that the Millennium Bug would cripple computers as the clock struck midnight on January 1, 2000.What can be said for sure is that no one knows what will happen if there is a No Deal exit. But we can be sure that it would have a convulsive economic shock.We have in place the planning, fiscal and monetary resources and, above all, an immutable national spirit to deal with whatever is thrown at us.Yet it could still be disorderly and painful, which is why I believe, even at this 11th hour, Mrs May\u0027s deal still offers Britain the best opportunity to preserve jobs and prosperity."},{"url":null,"title":"Botswana elephants leader considering cull saying country not zoo","story":"Share this article So what is the answer? Would trophy hunting and culling stop elephants over-running the place? Certainly there are those who say it would. Not only that, they claim it would stop poaching too.Professor Keith Somerville, a fellow of London\u0027s Zoological Society and an expert on conservation in Africa, has pointed out that hunting safari operators efficiently policed their shooting areas to keep out poachers.Today, the criminals can slip in easily to Botswana from neighbouring countries and kill with near-impunity. Dr Chase\u0027s charity, for example, has revealed that it counted 87 recently killed elephant carcasses in northern Botswana during one aerial survey last year, higher than previous counts. Many were in the Okavango Delta, the epicentre of the Botswana tourist industry, which without hunting concentrates on photo-safaris.         Farmers used to receive a share of the country\u0027s income from big game tourism — a trophy hunter can pay £45,000 to shoot one animal, but today they get nothingHorrifyingly, the report included 63 pages of pictures of dead elephants, many with their tusks brutally hacked off and said to have been killed by poaching and ivory-trading networks.Most demand for elephant ivory comes from Asia. And while the international trade in ivory has been banned since 1990, illegal sales are flourishing still to Hong Kong, Japan, the United States and China, where the black market price of a big bull\u0027s pair of tusks can top £30,000.But it is the devastating impact of elephants on Botswana\u0027s people and the landscape they live in that really concerns the country\u0027s government. On the outskirts of the Moremi game reserve, which includes part of the Okavango Delta, there are hundreds of the animals.They wander across the road, eat at the grass verges, and push over trees as they march from waterhole to waterhole with the tourist cameras following their every move.So many photo-tourists visit Africa — and particularly Botswana — that their presence stresses out elephants, making them violent towards humans and each other, a new report said this week.Published by Liverpool\u0027s John Moores University, it warned that elephants\u0027 health is endangered as resting or feeding herds are disturbed by trucks of tourists.The conflict between growing elephant numbers and humans was highlighted in a letter to the Times newspaper a few weeks ago.         Most demand for elephant ivory comes from Asia. And while the international trade in ivory has been banned since 1990, illegal sales are flourishing still to Hong Kong, Japan, the United States and China, where the black market price of a big bull\u0027s pair of tusks can top £30,000London businessman Richard Colgan wrote: \u0027Having recently returned from a safari in the Okavango Delta region, I can confirm the damage to the bush caused by the ever-increasing elephant population. The landscape, at times, resembled a bleached First World War battlefield with splintered and dying trees as far as the eye could see, all the result of the catastrophic damage caused by the elephants.\u0027As the elephant population there grows unchecked, conflicts with the country\u0027s relatively small human population grow acute. \u0027All the locals I met were fully supportive of a programme of elephant control (by allowing hunts and commercialising the meat produced).\u0027Botswana is a democratic country that cares deeply about its wildlife. We (in the West) should not criticise its moves to deal with something that is a threat . . . this is their \u0027backyard\u0027 after all, not ours.\u0027Few iniduals would agree more wholeheartedly than 70-year-old farmer Boitshwarelo Seeptetswe, whom I found sitting with his wife, Atsile, under an awning in the middle of fields in the Okavango Delta, 16 miles from the village of Tubu where they have a small house.The couple travelled here by donkey cart and have put up a bell tent beneath the awning so they can stay overnight to try to fend off elephants from the 15-acre patch.Mr Seeptetswe tries to grow maize and pumpkins to feed his family. \u0027But now the elephants come and eat our crops. They have been here more times than I can count. The last time was two nights ago.\u0027They take what they want and we have to sit here and watch. We try to frighten them off by burning rubbish, but they are not scared of humans anymore\u0027, he tells me sadly in his threadbare and ripped work trousers.          Father Mange, his wife Omphemetse Mange (right), her husband Father Mange and friend Ntshonga Mabi walk back to their encampment with damaged pumpkins\u0027Nearly everything that we have grown they have eaten. We are having to buy the grain and vegetables that we would have taken home from this land, food that would keep our family all year.\u0027Yet this land was first ploughed by my forefathers. There were no elephants then. It is a new thing that has happened since they banned the hunting.\u0027Mr Seeptetswe cannot shoot the elephants that plague their lives because farmers — like safari tourists — are bound by the no-hunting rules.His son-in-law, Father Mange who is 44, takes up the tale. \u0027Last summer, I was at a hut I use some nights to watch over my cattle and goats.\u0027I was outside feeding the goats at 6.50 in the morning at the front of the hut when I heard an elephant burst through my fence and go to the back of the hut, which is only made of reeds and thatch.\u0027He stood there watching me. I ran back to the front door and hid inside. I could hear him rampaging behind me. I did not dare move. I was very afraid and did not come out for a long time that morning until it had gone quiet.\u0027The elephants have also traumatised the family\u0027s home village of Tubu, says Father\u0027s wife, 39-year-old Omphemetse.\u0027We have five children and the youngest is only four months. The elephants came two weeks ago, right up to the village boundary in the evening. They were eating the trees and pulling at the grass until the land was bare. We all ran to our houses and had to keep the children quiet,\u0027 she says.Father adds: \u0027The attacks by elephants started since the hunting ban. They no longer have fear of us. They have attacked our cars, they will chase our donkeys at a waterhole, they have killed cows and humans.\u0027One of our neighbours has decided not to plough his land this year, not to grow anything at all, so the elephants do not come to eat near his house.\u0027Last year, he was blinded when he ran away from an elephant which was chasing him. He was bending low under the trees as he got away and a thorn pricked him in the eye.\u0027Father tells the tragic story of 60-year-old John Monnaatshiupi, a friend of the family who was killed last October by an elephant near Tubu. \u0027He was in one of the streams near here collecting water lilies to take to the market. He was attacked by elephants who gored him from his waist to his chin.\u0027\u0027It was a terrible way to die,\u0027 says Father. \u0027He left a wife and seven children. I saw his dead body and the expression on his face. It was contorted with horror and fear. Now when I think of elephants my stomach churns.\u0027John is not the only one to have been killed. Two other adults have died in the area and last spring an 11-year-old boy was rushed by his mother to the local hospital in Gumare after he was trampled as he played in the bush.His life was saved, according to the hospital\u0027s medical officer Dr Alex Kalonji. \u0027There are a lot of elephants here and people do get injured,\u0027 he told me in his office last week. \u0027I had one in my own back garden at 4.30 the other morning. Of course, there are unfortunate people who are killed by an elephant. And then there is nothing we can do for them.\u0027As the West dictates how one African country cares for thousands of elephants, it would do well to remember the poor souls who have lost their lives and livelihoods since the ban on big game hunting in Botswana.Perhaps it is patronising even to question why they — the ordinary people — might welcome the return of the hunters\u0027 rifles."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3834350.1553193025!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"constant coffee keeps daffodil day fundraising going","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMike O’Donoghue, along with his dog ‘Buddy’,  at his home in Pallasgreen, Co Limerick, prior to his all-day fundraiser for Daffodil Day 2019.

On Daffodil Day in 2015, he had would-be coffee drinkers popping into his living room from 10am until 10pm, with some staying after the clock struck midnight.“I wanted to help after all the ICS had done for me when I had cancer and decided to host a 12-hour coffee ‘day’ with the help of three young neighbours,” he says.“So together with Tara Campbell, Saoirse Corbett and Sarah Dillon, in 2015 we poured tea and coffee for neighbours and friends for 14 hours.”The quartet lay claim to having the longest running coffee morning in Ireland. O’Donoghue says, “ 280 people turned up the first year and over 300 the following years. Each year the house is pretty much full all day long.”The retired postman says the event is a community effort rather than a solo one as everyone does what they can, donating baked goods and cups and plates. “In the days leading up to the event, so many people help with donations and others bring something on the day,” he says.“It brings all ages together – we have some guests who can’t yet walk and plenty of elderly people as well, in fact, two years ago, our oldest visitor was 100.”“Our coffee day is the biggest of its kind in the country and also the longest,” he says. “The first year our aim was to raise €500, but we raised €3,100 and the figure has been rising ever since, with last year’s total at €6,030.”Ahead of Friday’s fundraising events, the Irish Cancer Society revealed that Irish women will be he first in the world to take part in a clinical trial to treat one of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer.The study will see women with advanced triple negative breast cancer treated with the experimental drug “COTI-2” in combination with chemotherapy at St Vincent’s University Hospital in Dublin.More than 250 people are diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer each year. It is often aggressive, difficult to treat and tends to be more common in younger women.The research is being carried out by Dr Naoise Synnott in University College Dublin and SVUH and is supervised by Prof Joe Duffy and Prof John Crown. Her work was funded by the ICS’s research programme and the Clinical Cancer Research Trust.It is hoped the trial, funded by Cotinga Pharmaceuticals, will begin recruiting patients later this year. It will be aimed at women whose triple negative breast cancer has spread beyond the breast.For this year’s Daffodil Day, the society hopes to raise €4million to support cancer patients and their families. www.cancer.ie "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3833868.1553209533!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit summit happening the key things emerging today","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            A man with painted EU and British flags on his face is seen ahead of a EU Summit in Brussels.

Photograph: Julien WarnandEPAWhere are we now?On Wednesday, British prime minister Theresa May signalled formally to the EU that she wished to extend the Article 50 process , delaying the date on which the UK would leave the EU from March 29th to June 30th. This request was considered by the leaders of the other 27 EU countries during their meeting in Brussels starting on Thursday afternoon. They must approve an extension unanimously.In a televised address from Number 10 Downing Street on Wednesday night, Mrs May sought to put the blame on MPs for the proposed delay, with an extraordinary attack on parliament in which she urged them to say what Brexit, if any, they want.The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk – who as chair of the council of leaders runs the summits -– indicated the British must pass the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons next week before an extension is granted. However as EU leaders discussed the issue they appeared to move between a range of proposals, with contacts also under way with the UK prime minister to see what she would agree to. At one stage a May 7th deadline was proposed. However by late evening a proposal was agreed. If the House of Commons approves the withdrawal agreement, Brexit will happen on May 22nd. If not, the UK would leave with no-deal on April 12th – or could apply for a longer extension but likely under strict conditions, including the election of MEPs.What did Mrs May say to EU leaders today?You often hear the complaint from Brussels - with some justification - that nobody knows what the British want. But Mrs May said clearly what she wanted – ratification by EU leaders of an agreement at Strasbourg last week which includes the concessions and clarifications on accelerated talks on the future relationship and the temporary nature of the backstop, and an extension of the Brexit date from tomorrow week until June 30th.The first won’t be a problem. But the second caused legal difficulties for the EU which favours a shorter extension, expiring before the European parliament elections at the end of May. Draft summit conclusions had suggested an extension to May 22nd, subject to the withdrawal agreement being passed.And after a number of other dates were discussed, this remained, but further details were added.The risk of a crash out at the end of next week was taken off the table. However if the House of Commons votes down the agreement, then the UK could still crash out on April 12th. Or the option has been left open for the UK to seek a longer extension, subject to electing MEPs and, presumably, committing to find some new way forward. Meanwhile if the House of Commons does approve the deal, the EU would depart on May 22nd.Entering the meeting,French president Emmanuel Macron laid down a clear marker, saying his view was that if the withdrawal agreement was not passed, then “we will be going to a no-deal.” However now the UK may have a little more time to do so. What then happens if the House of Commons approves the withdrawal agreement?If the withdrawal agreement is passed before the extension runs out then the UK leaves in a planned fashion. The UK would exit the EU and enter what is called the transition period, a kind of standstill in which pretty much everything will remain the same until at least the end of 2020 – except for the fact that the UK will have left. During this period the two sides will try to agree trading arrangements for the long-term.What happens if May fails to get the deal approved?It appeared going into the summit that Theresa May would have to get the deal approved next week, or face the real risk of a no-deal exit on March 29th.There was talk of an emergency EU summit next week – and possibly other options to avoid a no-deal crash. Now the immediate heat is likely to be taken out of the situation,but only for a short time. If the House of Commons votes down the deal again, then it is all back in the melting pot. The longer timetable could also give time for political developments in the UK, with a majority in the Commons opposed to a no-deal exit and apparently shocked by May’s willingness to consider this option. But it remains to be seen if something emerges from the UK parliament.How did today end up ?As is normal, there are draft conclusions, agreed in advance by diplomats and government officials, circulating on the other aspects of the summit today. But there were no draft conclusions on Brexit and then the ones which did emerge changed, on a number of occasions.Irish sources say two things: they haven’t seen this level of uncertainty about a summit since the Greek crisis.This process has long been described by various sides as a game of chicken. If that is so, it only gets interesting at the end. And we are in the end phase now, even if there may now be a few weeks to run.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

But after she left the room in the Europa building, the other 27 leaders spent more than five hours working out the terms of an extension to the article 50 deadline.By 11pm, the leaders had gone through multiple drafts, changing dates and conditions for departure. They appeared to settle on a formula that would give Britain an unconditional extension until April 12th, just two weeks after the statutory exit date of March 29th.But if parliament approves Mrs May’s Brexit deal next week, Britain would be able to remain in the EU until May 22nd. If MPs fail to back the deal next week, the prime minister could seek to negotiate an extension to the April 12th deadline – but only if she agreed to hold European Parliament elections on May 23rd.Even before her ill-judged statement from 10 Downing Street on Wednesday when she blamed MPs for having to postpone Brexit, her deal looked unlikely to win a majority next week. But Brexiteers will face a stark choice between backing Mrs May’s deal next week and risking parliament instructing the government to hold European Parliament elections and seek a longer extension.Speaker John Bercow’s ruling that the prime minister cannot continue to bring the same proposition back to the Commons means that she may have only one more chance to put her deal to the vote. Unconditional extensionBy offering an unconditional extension until April 12th, EU leaders would move the no-deal Brexit cliff edge by three weeks but keep the pressure on MPs to back the prime minister’s deal next week.Earlier on Thursday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer met EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and European Commission secretary general Martin Selmayr.Mr Corbyn said he did not believe Mrs May’s deal was the right way forward but that his proposal for a softer Brexit, including full customs union membership, could command a majority.“We think that what we’re proposing can be achieved in the British parliament we do believe we can construct a majority that will prevent the crashing out and all the chaos that will come from crashing out and that’s what we’re absolutely focused on,” he said. Various factionsAmong the difficulties Mrs May has faced in attempting to win parliamentary approval for her deal is the fact that various factions of MPs remain confident that they can secure their preferred option for Brexit. The House of Commons has already shown that there is a majority against a no-deal Brexit, so Brexiteers have an incentive to vote for the prime minister’s deal rather than risk a long delay or a softer Brexit.Advocates of a second referendum have withheld support until now for a softer version of Brexit but they could be faced with a choice between Mrs May’s deal and something like Labour’s formula of a customs union and close alignment with the single market.The EU leaders have deftly wiped their fingerprints from the threat of a no-deal Brexit but they have left Mrs May and British MPs with a series of unpalatable and potentially perilous choices. And as the British prime minister sat in a delegation room while 27 other EU leaders determined her options for Brexit, her country’s national humiliation was laid bare as never before.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA In approving Mrs May’s request for a short extension, albeit conditionally, EU leaders have effectively done no more than kick the can down the road for a few days.The hard decisions come next week, if and when the Commons again votes down the withdrawal agreement in meaningful vote three (MV3).No point in crossing bridges until you have to.Should MV3 be agreed on Monday or Tuesday, leaders were all of a mind, the UK would be given an extra two months, until May 22nd, to put its house in order so that the UK could enter transition from the EU in an orderly manner.The extension would be formally approved by written procedure – no need for the leaders to return to Brussels.In the more likely event that MV3 is voted down, the permission for the requested extension would lapse and we are in a different ballgame.Mrs May would then have to decide if she wanted to make another application for the same short extension, or, more controversially, for a long extension. The leaders would have to reconvene.If, on the other hand, she decided that this has all gone on too long and she has no hope of prevailing, she could throw in the towel and the UK would simply leave the EU next Friday at 11pm.Few imagine however she will do so and they expect one last throw of the extension dice in Brussels.A request for an extension to May 22nd is likely to be approved easily, even if leaders are not convinced that Mrs May can win support for the withdrawal agreement or for an alternative soft Brexit plan should she decide to try that approach.StrategyFor EU leaders to reject the renewed request would appear churlish and they are determined to explore every avenue out of the impasse – not only do they not want a no-deal Brexit but they certainly don’t want to be blamed for such an eventuality.A request next week for a longer extension would, however, pose all sorts of problems. Firstly, it would require a convincing justification. Leaders will want to be persuaded that the British prime minister has a new strategy for overcoming the deadlock.The EU leaders have repeatedly said that changes to the political declaration are still possible and an expression of willingness by May to embrace a customs union membership and strong ties to the single market – a reversal of key red lines – would certainly qualify as such a justification.However improbable.\u0026nbspAnd so would a general election.Secondly, the British would have to reverse their position on not contesting the European elections. If they remain members while the elections are under way there are several million citizens who could\u0026nbspdemand their vote in the courts.But there are also, it appears, subtle differences between some of the key member states about whether such a long extension should be granted if the UK can make a persuasive case. The Germans still insist that the leaders must do everything they can to delay and if possible overturn Brexit.A source close to German chancellor Merkel told journalists on the eve of the Council that “our patience is unlimited. For us the relationship with the UK is a central pillar of the EU itself and a key element of its future architecture.“We also think that the start of our future relationship shouldn’t be a crash. Therefore we will do anything to ensure that doesn’t happen.”It is a view supported by the Dutch and almost certainly the Irish.The French are less flexible, and not out of hostility to the UK.Paris and Berlin have different appreciations of the ability of the British political system to get itself out of this mess.French president Emmanuel Macron has let it be known he views a long extension as pointless, a continuation of uncertainty for businesses and citizens, and an obstacle to the EU’s other important agenda items, not least discussions on its future shape.A unanimous vote on a lengthy extension could prove difficult to achieve at next week’s emergency summit.Should it happen.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Hayoung JeonEPAWith an uncharacteristic flash of Churchillian passion, German chancellor Angela Merkel has promised to push for an orderly UK departure from the EU “to the last day, to the last hour”.Her promise follows a new German study suggesting the Republic of Ireland would be the second-biggest economic loser from a hard Brexit, with an annual loss off economic power equivalent to €720 per head of population.The study by the Bertelsmann Foundation found that a no-deal Brexit would cost Germany about €10 billion annually, or €115 per head of population. Britons have the most to fear: an economic slump of €57 billion annually or €900 per head of population.\u0026nbspAfter Ireland (€720 per capita), the study says a hard Brexit would hit hardest, in order, France and Italy.“Brussels and London have to do everything to order a departure,” said Aart De Geus, chief executive of the Bertelsmann Foundation.Some 1,001 days after the Brexit vote, with just eight days until the scheduled Brexit departure date, Dr Merkel told the Bundestag yesterday she agreed with European Council president Donald Tusk’s analysis. A short extension of the March 29th deadline until the end of June, as requested by British prime minister Theresa May, was possible in theory. But only, the chancellor said, if parliament backs the Brexit agreement agreed between London and Brussels.“We can meet this request . . . we need an orderly Brexit, this is also in the German interest,” said Dr Merkel ahead of a gathering of EU leaders in Brussels yesterday. “However much we are working towards an orderly solution, for weeks and months we have prepared for the fact that there could be a disorderly departure.”Mrs May’s request would also have to take into consideration any legal concerns regarding the European elections at the end of May, the German leader added.“But no doubt we can talk positively about a short extension,” she added.For Brexiteers expecting a last-minute extra wurst from Berlin, the German leader disappointed. The existing departure documents, in particular the more recent additions from Strasbourg, showed that “important and, in my view sufficient steps were taken”.Looking to the future, she said relations would not be as close with the UK as when it was an EU member state, but the chancellor insisted that “the door to a close co-operation, in friendship and in common interest, from our side, stands wide open”.Exhaustion and mockeryFor the order-loving Germans, their growing concern and alarm over the Brexit drama in London has collapsed decades of deep respect towards Britain. Now media coverage is characterised largely by exhaustion and mockery.The conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine daily put a hamster on its front page, flagging a feature inside about stock-piling of medicines.In the picture’s caption, the FAZ joked that London’s “unparalleled spectacle . . . a drama shot through with curious and unworthy spices” has left everyone “unsure whether to laugh or cry”.Germany’s political class is similarly unsure how to respond to the Brexit drama. And not everyone in Dr Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is as magnanimous as the chancellor. Norbert Röttgen, head of the Bundestag foreign affairs committee, said he favoured a long extension or none at all.“The EU cannot allow itself to become part of the political tactics of Theresa May,” he said on German radio. “Trump and Putin are laughing themselves silly at how Europe is carrying on.”As Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn followed Theresa May to Brussels, its sister party in Germany – the Social Democrats (SPD) – called for a cross-party solution to overcome Brexit uncertainties.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

In the interim the British government can make further attempts to secure Commons passage of the withdrawal agreement agreed with the EU in November, and the linked political declaration on the future relationship. Or indeed, as EU leaders have repeatedly suggested in recent days, it can seek an alternative to the political declaration that would secure broader Commons support – which would inevitably mean a repudiation of key British red lines. Mrs May spoke to the summit for half an hour and was pressed for another hour with questions by the leaders, before leaving the 27 to their deliberations. But she declined to speculate when asked about what she would do if the Commons again votes down the withdrawal agreement.The Financial Times reported one senior diplomat saying that a frustrated French president Emmanuel Macron asked Mrs May: “Theresa, where are we going?” Mr Macron had made clear his opposition to granting the UK a lengthy extension.He warned leaders that Britain was heading for a no-deal Brexit unless the House of Commons ratified the withdrawal agreementLeaders in their debate disagreed over whether to make the offer of an extension conditional on passage of the withdrawal agreement in the Commons. Early drafts of the European Council conclusions included conditionality.The formal approval of the Strasbourg assurances by the council should assist Mrs May in arguing that there are significant changes to the deal that has twice been voted down, enabling it to be put to the Commons again. The council once again also declared in its formal “conclusions” that the EU would not renegotiate the Brexit orce terms included in the withdrawal agreement.Speaking earlier to the summit, European Parliament president Antonio Tajani expressed the frustration of many of the leaders. “We have shown great patience, given additional assurances and drawn up legal interpretations, as we have been asked to do. And all for nothing it would seem,” he said.If the UK was prepared to demonstrate flexibility, however, “If the UK Parliament can succeed in changing the red lines, for example by asking to retain membership of the Customs Union, then the backstop too will cease to be such a thorny issue,” Mr Tajani said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Although at first some found them strange-looking or were convinced they would fall out of their ears, they quickly became the in-ear wireless headphone to aspire to.Rarely in the two years and three months since launch has demand eased off. As a result, the look has gone from curious to acceptable to – dare I say it\u0026nbsp– iconic. And certainly ubiquitous.Now, the second-generation AirPods have been announced, I talked to Greg Joswiak, Apple’s Vice President of Product Marketing and Kate Bergeron, Vice President of Hardware Engineering about the new arrivals.The new AirPods look, at first glance, like the older model, even down to the price, which remains the same at £159. There is no difference in the look or shape of the buds themselves and there is only one visible change to the case: a Wireless Charging Case is now available\u0026nbspfor an extra £40, allowing you to place the case on a compatible wireless charging pad instead of plugging it in with a Lightning cable.This means there’s a tiny LED on the outside of the case to show when it’s charging.\u0026nbspThe new\u0026nbspAirPods\u0026nbspare on sale online now and will be in Apple Stores next week.Created with Sketch.Apple unveils the iPhone X Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017So far, so good.“The bigger picture, though, is that AirPods simply deliver a magical wireless experience.”I’m not sure I like using the word magical, but I see what he’s saying. Pairing AirPods with an iPhone is exceptionally simple. As Joswiak explains, “As soon as you’ve pulled the AirPods out of the box and flipped open the lid on the case, there’s a simple one-tap set-up, they’re automatically paired and connected. Once you’ve done that, they’re immediately set up to work with all your Apple devices, including an Apple Watch, iPad or Mac that uses the same Apple ID. Once you’ve used AirPods, you never go back. They’re the most popular wireless headphones in the world. They’ve become a cultural phenomenon. For us, they’re the key ingredient to the wireless future. We designed them to be effortless to use.”Open the case near an iPhone and a screen will pop up showing the exact battery life. And there are other cool features, like the way when you’re talking to someone, and you naturally take one of the AirPods out your ear to do so, the music pauses, resuming when you put the bud back into your ear.All these features remain the same in the new version. By the way, you can use AirPods with Android phones, for instance, but the pairing is not as seamless.Kate Bergeron explains the new headphones in more detail:\u0026nbsp“When we were thinking about generation two, we really wanted to focus on this new H1 chip that was designed specifically for headphones. We’re combining wireless technology which is a hallmark of Apple’s and very highly customised audio. Together, these things create an amazing audio experience. Because the H1 chip is more powerful, it delivers some profound efficiencies, which means you can have Siri available all the time.”Ah, yes, I forgot to say, another AirPods feature is the way you can tap on either of the buds while they are in your ear and then ask Siri, Apple’s virtual personal assistant, to change the track, lift the volume or even give you spoken directions to wherever you’re going.AirPods 2 on Wednesday, 20 March (Apple)Now, with the new AirPods, you don’t need to tap. Just say, “Hey, Siri” and it will respond. This is made possible thanks to the H1 chip saving so much battery life that it can be listening for the magic wake words at all times.“So, we’re able to have \u0027Hey, Siri\u0027 listening enabled at all times and still keep the same battery life as before: five hours’ listening time is still achieved thanks to this new chip,” Bergeron says.“In addition, we’ve been able to deliver 50 per cent more talk time so when you’re on a call, you’ll have three hours of battery life, not two.”Leaving aside whether jabbering on for three hours is really desirable, this is quite a feat. So, how come more talk time but no extra battery life? That’s because when you’re talking, listening out for “Hey, Siri” is turned off.Switching between devices is up to twice as fast, now, too. “If you’re using your AirPods between your Mac, your iPhone and your iPad, switching is even more seamless and the connection to phone calls, when you’re pulling your AirPods out of your pocket to connect to a phone call, is up to 50 per cent faster than before,” Bergeron says. “In addition, for some casual gaming on your iPhone, for instance, we’re able to provide up to 30 per cent lower latency.”My experience of Apple’s stats in situations like this is that the figures don’t mean that much but the experience when you use them is noticeably different.Apple leak reveals bizarre new feature for 2019 iPhoneApple unveils brand new iPads in surprise announcementThe improved chip means improved audio in different ways, too. “The combination of the wireless changes we’ve made in the chip as well as the audio gives a more robust wireless connection, which turns into better audio quality in different conditions. When going outside, some people have found that in that environment there can be problems maintaining RF (radio frequency) links. Now, in all sorts of different conditions we find we’re able to have better audio quality all the time.”The LED on the new wireless charging case is the main visible difference compared to the previous case. “The cases are exactly the same size, there’s a slight increase in weight thanks to adding the wireless charging coil but it’s negligible.”Wireless charging is traditionally slower than through a Lightning cable. “It’s just over two hours to charge the case from zero to 100 per cent via Lightning,” Joswiak chips in, “and around three-and-a-half hours wirelessly. But realistically, customers rarely charge from zero, and the fast charge is the same as before – just put the AirPods themselves into the charging case for 15 minutes and you get three hours of listening time.”Apple is expected to release a new version of iOS, the operating software for iPhones and iPads, soon. I wonder if the new hands-free Siri feature will have to wait for that, but Joswiak’s reply is elegant rather than factually revealing: “We always recommend that for every new product that customers install the latest version of software that’s available at that time.”Reading the runes, I would imagine it means that by the time the new AirPods reach customers next week, that enhanced software will be available to make hands-free Siri work.The new AirPods are a big event because almost no product attracts the level of interest of these little in-ear wireless headphones.\u0026nbsp Next week, if they live up to Apple’s promises, they’ll be even more desirable.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.421 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 721 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1021 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2021 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

Thousands of students as part of the Youth for Climate movement took time off school to call for stronger action against climate change.A Conservative plan to change the law to allow new grammar schools to open was scrapped following the general election – but selective schools are still allowed to expand, or open annexes.Dr Nuala Burgess, chair of Comprehensive Future, said: “The legal position is very clear – new grammar schools are illegal.“It’s a shocking use of education funding to try to bypass the law and build a new grammar school via the back door.\u0026nbsp“If this goes ahead, there’s nothing to stop the Department for Education from building dozens of dubious ‘annexe’ grammar schools all around the country, all without parliamentary scrutiny, and all in breach of the law.”Grammar schools look to open \u0027annexes\u0027 amid ban on selectionShe added that the country needs “good, properly funded, local secondary schools that work for everyone”.Last year, the Weald of Kent Grammar School opened a controversial annexe in Sevenoaks – 10 miles from its original site – after ministers ruled it to be an expansion of the same school.“The government is expanding selective education and ignoring all the evidence that such a system harms the life chances of our poorest pupils,” said Dr Burgess.“Expanding grammar schools deprives three or four surrounding schools of their most talented pupils, dramatically impacting on attainment levels.\u0026nbsp“This is why Kent’s results are so poor, and the problem certainly isn’t going to be fixed by creating another grammar school.”Government gives £50m to expand grammar schools amid funding \u0027crisis\u0027Government gives £50m to 16 grammar schools for 4,000 pupilsThousands protest against grammar school plans to boost poorer pupilsThe grammar-comprehensive school advantage gap has never been so wideThe two schools in Kent are bidding for funding from the Selective School Expansion Fund, which awards £50m\u0026nbspeach year to grammar schools that can demonstrate “ambitious and realistic” plans to boost the intake of disadvantaged pupils.According to Comprehensive Future, Barton Court currently admits 9.7 per cent of pupils classed as disadvantaged, while Queen Elizabeth’s is said to admit 6 per cent.The campaign group said it was seeking legal advice about whether there was potential to challenge the funding of a satellite selective school using Department for Education funding.The Independent has contacted Barton Court Grammar School, Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School and Kent County Council for comment.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Are you kidding me? Give me a break! Everyone, including Facebook, have tech debt and security debt that piles up. But that\u0027s not an excuse any longer, Sam Curry, chief security officer at security firm Cybereason, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Facebook is starting to look like critical social infrastructure, where there responsibility is to the public. It\u0027s past time to go back and clean the skeletons out of the closets. How can we trust this platform to get bigger and get more connected under the hood if they can\u0027t do the basis blocking and tackling right?

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

Nor is the belief that it remains one even now. Knowledgeable historians calculated that it was once the greatest empire in human history, if one takes into account both the territory it controlled and the time its\u0026nbspdomination lasted.\u0026nbspAdventurous political analysts have argued that in recent times Russia is inclined to regain its imperial powers. As Zbigniew Brzesinski, the former\u0026nbspnational security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, put it in 1997: “without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire … however, if Moscow regains control over Ukraine, Russia automatically again regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state, ning Europe and Asia.”\u0026nbspThe annexation of Crimea is apparent evidence of this process.Yet many observers believe the present “empire” (ie the Russian Federation) might itself collapse once more, dissolving into different parts. Some politicians hope that it will.Very few, however, attempt to understand the nature of the Russian imperial project – and the similarities and differences between the Russian empire and the other European ones.The most striking similarity between the Russian and the western imperial histories – the one that is arguably critical to any European adventure of the kind – is the fact that they were clearly ided into two discrete, consecutive phases.\u0026nbspWhat the Roman empire can tell us about modern middle eastThe first was the period of settler colonisation, by which the applicable imperial power subjugates great landmasses either on its own continent or overseas, and relocates there significant numbers of people, to the point they are able to outnumber the indigenous tribes. This was the case for the Russians in Siberia, for the French in Louisiana and Canada, for the British in the Thirteen Colonies, Australia and New Zealand, as well as, in some senses, for the Spanish in Latin America.\u0026nbspAll these appropriations were made between the early 16th and mid-18th centuries and resulted in what Angus Maddison called “the western offshoots”.\u0026nbspThe second phase involved more straightforward military conquest this tended to see locals being dominated by relatively small regular armies and a complicated system of vassalage (like in the case of the British Raj in India). Here Russia followed the western path as well: just as the French conquered Indochina and west Africa and the British took huge parts of Asia, from modern Pakistan to Malaya, and of Africa, from Kenya to Rhodesia, so the Russians added to their empire both the Caucasus and parts of central Asia, confronting the British during the Pandjeh incident of 1885.In both phases, Russia was as European in its behaviour as either Great Britain or France: it built its empire directed by European logic and using European means of communication and warfare. Nevertheless, between the western method and the Russian approach there was one huge difference.Created with Sketch.Protests break out after Russia seize Ukraine warships Show all 32Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Activists of opposition parties burn flares during a rally demanding to break an agreement with Russia on the use of the Azov Sea and the Kerch Strait, in front of the parliament building in KievVolunteers with the right-wing paramilitary Azov National Corps light flares during a rally on the snowy streets in front of the Ukrainian parliament in Kiev after Russia seized two of their armored artillery vessels and a tug boat in the Black SeaUkrainian Nationalists demand to break the diplomatic relations with Russia and nationalization of Russian property in UkraineUkrainian activists burn flares during their rally in front of Russian Consulate in KharkivSeized Ukrainian ships, small armoured artillery ships and a tug boat, are seen anchored in a port of KerchThe President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced, on 25 November, at a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council that they will introduce martial law in Ukraine for a period of 60 days and appeal to the Parliament to consider the moveRussia seized two small-sized \u0027Berdiansk\u0027 and \u0027Nikopol\u0027 armored artillery boats.

This forced the colonial powers to turn to military force effectively to create new, second empires – usually in different places.\u0026nbspIn Russia’s empire, meanwhile, neither its Siberian provinces nor the newly “reconciled” lands of today’s Ukraine and Belarus tried to secede.\u0026nbspTherefore, while Britain and France in fact possessed two different empires each, consecutively, the first and the second Russian empires (the first achieved through settler colonisation, the second through military action) were simply added to one another, rather like the traditional Russian matryoshka doll.\u0026nbspThis key difference between the imperial histories of Russia and the west helps to explain how the European powers have ended up where they are today.In particular, let’s consider the dissolution of the Soviet Union. With some minor exceptions, the borders of Russia now resemble those that existed in the mid-17th century, the time when the first empires of both Russia and the west powers were almost complete. Therefore, I would argue that the fall of the USSR was broadly the same process which evolved on a global scale between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970s and which is widely known as “decolonisation”\u0026nbsp(I dislike the word because I believe the European overseas appropriations of the time were not colonies, but rather military controlled possessions).\u0026nbspBut whereas this process ultimately left countries like Britain and France without empires at all, today’s Russia lost only its second – by retaining its first, it never lost its ambition for future re-expansion.For political elites in Russia and Ukraine, war still makes senseHere we should return to history.\u0026nbspThe Russian and the western empires were similar as it comes to the timings of their creation and to the methods of their construction – but they differ from each other in terms of the actors that stood behind the process.In western Europe the major nations (kingdoms then of course) had gained a clear national identity before they started their colonial adventures. Portugal, the oldest European nation state, fully sovereign since 1143, was the first to launch its overseas expansion. France emerged in full grandeur after peace with Britain in 1453 and the defeat of Burgundy in 1482 Spain became united in 1469 and Britain itself evolved as a single state after England was joined by Scotland and Ireland under James I in 1603.\u0026nbspWe can see this period as pre-imperial. By the time the Portuguese, the Spanish, the French, and the British sought to expand overseas, their own national unity was beyond question. This meant that when their first empires dissolved towards the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, little damage was done to the sense of national identity of the imperial bases. As a consequence, the later, “second” empires appeared in the same sense British and French, as were the earlier ones.Contemporary Russia remains and will remain an empire since it simply has no place to retreat toIn Russia, things followed a different path. Moscow, a small settlement at the time when the Kievan Rus’ (the medieval alliance of Slavic and Finnic groups) reached its apex in the 11th and 12th centuries, became stronger when the separated Russian princedoms fought for their liberation from the Mongols.\u0026nbspTill that time, the vast country we call Russia today was united not so much by national or even quasi-national identity, as by its Orthodox faith as well as by the belief that it had become the beacon of the “true” Christian faith after the fall of Constantinople.\u0026nbspThe Muscovites overthrew the Mongol domination in 1480 and less than a century later ruined the Mongol khanates in the Volga region and started their expansion to the east. It took them another 100\u0026nbspyears to reach the Pacific shores – but in the west they weren’t able to advance further than the current border between Russia and Belarus.\u0026nbsp“Russia” as the country’s name became widespread in the mid-17th century as all the three major centres of Russian statehood – Novgorod, Kiev and Vladimir – started to be governed from Moscow. But the key point about this development is that the Russian state emerged as an empire, was administered as an empire, and possessed many other imperial elements. In other words, Russia itself arose as an empire – built not by Russia, but rather by Muscovy. Therefore the first Russian empire was actually the empire of Moscow, and not the empire of Russia.The Muscovy-built empire called Russia consolidated itself during the 17th and 18th century, strengthening its domination both in its settler colonies in the east and in the “original” “Russian” lands in the west.\u0026nbspOnly as this consolidation process was actually completed did Russia begin\u0026nbspto conquer militarily neighbouring lands – from Finland in the North to the Caucasus in the south from Poland in the west to Bukhara and Kokand in the southeast.\u0026nbspAs such, the second Russian empire became an empire built by Russia, not Muscovy and in a self-fulfilling cycle, bolstered the sense of a “Russian” national identity.\u0026nbspThe imperial core of all the western European examples remained the same from beginning to end (Britain, France, Spain etc) in the Russian case, it changed from Muscovy to Russia. Therefore, in the 20th century it was not only Stalin’s will that ided the Soviet Union into different “Socialist Republics”, but rather Russia’s entire history. The vast “country” of the USSR consisted of the Russian republic, which had boundaries similar to the first Russian empire, and all the other republics which replicated the second Russian empire’s military possessions.\u0026nbspIt should be noted that while in the USSR-era Russian republic Russians themselves accounted for 81.5 per cent of the population according to the 1989 census. In none of the other Soviet republics did they make even a simple majority.\u0026nbspThis history and these demographics were the two major factors that made the Soviet Union ready for speedy disintegration after 1989.From all this, three crucial conclusions can be drawn.First, contemporary Russia remains and will remain an empire since it simply has no place to retreat to. As Russia lost its possessions in 1991 it returned to an entity territorially similar to one that started the last wave of expansion in the late 18th century.\u0026nbspOn the face of it, it looks like all the other European empires which, during the “decolonisation” of the 20th century were pushed back to those territorial limits from which they began. But while the western imperial cores were and always had been nation states, (some of them democracies and even republics), Russia was itself an empire when it started to expand two and a half centuries ago.\u0026nbspA socially acceptable form of murderRussia detains two US Mormons as tensions flare US generals ‘thinking about possibility of nuclear war’Russia orders all orcas and belugas kept in \u0027whale prison\u0027 be set freeThe Russians are European people who share the major European values and principles – but nevertheless Russia as a country arose not as a nation based on these values but as an empire driven by a thirst for power and expansion.\u0026nbspIf a nation state builds an empire and fails, it comes back to being a (hopefully better) nation state, one which transcends imperial aspirations. But if an empire constructs an even bigger empire and fails, it reemerges as an offended, revanchist and aggressive empire – exactly as Russia now looks like.The second I draw is that we should not expect Russia to fall apart, as many current observers suggest. Even though the country remains multiethnic, the Russians make up the majority of the population in almost every part of the country. I cannot think of any cases in which truly consolidated, culturally homogenous country collapses and is ided into parts unless as the result of a war (a prospect for which there are no markers).\u0026nbspInstances of countries existing as ided entities but being inhabited by the same ethnic group or people were all caused by military conflicts (East and West Germany, South and North Korea, North\u0026nbspand South\u0026nbspVietnam, continental China and Taiwan).\u0026nbspNo foreign force could at present defeat Russia militarily and cut it into parts moreover, the fear of external powers is so huge in today’s Russia that those parts of the country that used to have some inclination for greater autonomy (like\u0026nbspeastern Siberia or the far\u0026nbspeast), no longer do.\u0026nbspAnxiety in those areas about the growing influence of China outweighs any concerns about growing pressure from and “exploitation” by the (imperial) centre. As Russia becomes weaker in the economic and political sense, any outsider hopes for its dismemberment actually fade.The final conclusion is the most important and it is this. There is, despite everything, a crucial weakness in the existing political construct of the Russian “Federation”. Inside this federation there are still several regions that look completely alien to it – those that were acquired not during the first wave of empire-building but during the second.\u0026nbspThese territories are the entire north Caucasus, which was attached to Russia as a result of bloody wars in the mid-19th century, and the Republic of Tuva at the border with Mongolia that first became part of the Soviet Union in 1944. The north Causasus lands are by no means “Russian”: today the complete share of the ethnic Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian population in the “Russian” republic of Ingushetia is a mere 0.9 per cent. Compare this with\u0026nbspremote Kyrgyzstan, a sovereign nation in central Asia, where it accounts for close to 6 per cent.\u0026nbspThese parts of the current Russia are elements of the second empire which were incorporated into the first one due to a historical mistake. Things were nearly different: in early 1990s, as Chechnya revolted against the Russian rule, it was thought other regional republics were ready to follow – but it never happened. \u0026nbspNow, Russia claims it “re-established” its control over its former military possessions, although in reality it pays countless tribute to local “khans” and “emirs”. In the end though, these remnants of the second Russia empire will surely secede at some stage.\u0026nbspIn sum then, Russia is a unique creature: not so much superior to other European empires, but drastically different from them. These differences shouldn’t be either neglected or denied one should look on the country sine ira et studio for exploring its European nature and history and for understanding what might be expected from it in the future.\u0026nbspRussia is the last existing empire – and an empire that lasts, if not forever, than for longer than its western equivalents. It should not be criticised for this, but explored and investigated.Vladislav Inozemtsev’s new book, with Alexander Abalov, is ‘The Last Empire’, published\u0026nbspin Russian\u0026nbspby Alpina Publishing House.

It is able to identify different facial features, as well as glasses, clothing, makeup and facial hair.Up until now, Face ID has struggled to differentiate between identical twins, though Apple claims it is still significantly more advanced than its Touch ID fingerprint scanner.The creating and storing of facial maps have inevitably led to concerns from privacy advocates, who worry about the implications if such data was accidentally leaked and fell into the hands of malicious actors.“I think we should be quite worried,” Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspwhen the technology was first announced.“The chances we are going to see mischief around facial data is pretty high – if not today, then soon, and if not on Apple then on Android.”It is not clear whether Apple plans to introduce the new subepidermal\u0026nbsptechnology to Face ID in its 2019 range of iPhones and iPads, as the company\u0026nbspdoes not comment on rumours surrounding forthcoming products.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Of 750 reviews on the TrustPilot website, just 36 per cent rate Persimmon as “excellent”, compared with\u0026nbsp58 per cent describing the company as “poor” or “bad”.Persimmon‘s renewed attempt to win over customers comes after former chief executive\u0026nbspJeff Fairburn stepped down\u0026nbspearlier this year. His £75m\u0026nbspbonus had become a “distraction”, the company said.Chief executive Dave Jenkinson said: “Persimmon is listening hard to all of its stakeholders and we hear the message that we need to continue to raise our game in customer care.“The initiatives we have already announced –\u0026nbspincluding the action taken in the new year to deliver greater accuracy of anticipated moving-in dates by adopting a more targeted approach to the phasing of sales on specific sites and the improvements and investments that we have made in our customer care team, operations and technology over the last few months – are beginning to take effect.75m bonus but the build quality of Persimmon’s homes has been criticised (BBC)“We are now accelerating the pace of change through the introduction of a contracted retention, which will give homebuyers far greater satisfaction at the completion of the purchase.“Moving into a new home should be a positive experience enhanced by all the benefits of a new build that is designed for modern living.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

This, however, needs to be further investigated.”Humans share almost all of our DNA with cats, cattle and miceResearcher Derry Taylor monitored 22 of the animals –\u0026nbspnative to southeast Asia –\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspspontaneous social play sessions.The bears, aged up to 12, were housed in Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre in Malaysia in which enclosures were large enough to allow bears to choose whether to interact or not.During hundreds of play bouts, two distinct expressions were coded – one involving a display of the upper incisor teeth, and one without.\u0026nbspThe bears were most likely to show precise facial mimicry during gentle play.Mr Taylor said such subtle mimicking could be to help two bears signal that they are ready to play more roughly, or to strengthen social bonds.He said: “It is widely believed that we only find complex forms of communication in species with complex social systems.“As sun bears are a largely solitary species, our study of their facial communication questions this belief, because it shows a complex form of facial communication that until now was known only in more social species.”The results were published on Thursday in the online journal Scientific Reports.We’ll tell you what’s true.

If measurements from this field cannot be considered absolute, it could change how the discipline operates.“It seems that, in contrast to classical physics, measurement results cannot be considered absolute truth but must be understood relative to the observer who performed the measurement,” said Dr Ringbauer.“The stories we tell about quantum mechanics have to adapt to that.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation.

Not all companies are prepared for the worstWith a week to go, the prime minister has finally sought to delay Brexit. As things stand, however, there is no formal agreement between the government and the EU about the length of any Article 50 extension.So, what\u0026nbspwould\u0026nbspa Brexit delay do to inidual businesses in terms of\u0026nbspcontingency planning?Not much, is the answer.\u0026nbspOne thing to understand is that a lot of businesses simply haven’t done any.When the Institute of Directors (IoD) looked at this question earlier in the year it found 40 per cent of its members had taken no steps at all to prepare for a sudden no-deal situation.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThat may seem like extraordinary complacency, given the wretched state of a\u0026nbspUK government\u0026nbspled by arguably the worst prime minister in history. And in some cases, that’s probably true. (There is still the feeling that “it just won’t happen” in some quarters.)\u0026nbspBut there is a much larger slate of smaller firms that simply lack the resources to be able to plan effectively\u0026nbspfor the\u0026nbsplooming earthquake.\u0026nbspWatchdog bans advert encouraging loans to fund Brexit food stockpilesWe’re just over a week away from the notional exit date and it’s still the case that no one really\u0026nbsphas the faintest idea how (or when) this will end, and what the impact will be. That being the case, small firms have opted to take a wait and see approach. They will react to what emerges, because they don’t have much of a choice.\u0026nbspThe IoD, and the Scottish National Party, have called for businesses to be issued with prep vouchers, along the lines of\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspschemes the Irish and Dutch governments have put into operation.\u0026nbspThese, the IoD says, could persuade some to act in the event of a short delay by incentivising them to take preparatory measures.\u0026nbspWhatever is agreed, those businesses that are prepping will continue to do so. Those that aren’t will carry on crossing their fingersBut that looks unlikely at present. For a start, the EU doesn’t seem minded to agree to a short extension\u0026nbspand such a scheme would be an example of something the current government seems allergic to: forward-thinking policy-making.Suren Thiru, from the British Chambers of Commerce, says those that have been preparing for no deal will continue to do so if a delay is secured. That means a continuation of the weak investment that is slowing the UK economy to a crawl as resources are erted to emergency planning.\u0026nbspThe problem for all businesses, as he points out, is that there are just “so many key questions to which we don’t have answers”. How will trade work, how will customs work, how will\u0026nbspfirms lay their hands on the staff they need?The prospect of a “rolling”, non-date-specific delay fills businesses with almost as much horror as no deal (which\u0026nbspmost regard as the equivalent of Hereditary, The Exorcist\u0026nbspand Children of the Corn all merged into one).\u0026nbspSo whatever is agreed, those businesses that are prepping will keep doing so. Those that aren’t will carry on crossing their fingers in the hope of Westminster coming to its senses.\u0026nbspThey’d probably best cross their toes, and anything else they can lay their hands on while they’re at it.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

The letter focuses on overshooting a March deadline for re-opening the seaside attraction. The work and pensions secretary\u0026nbspsaid she “can’t support any scenario” in which the pier remains closed indefinitely.While she is the MP for the area, Ms Rudd has little power to intervene as the pier is privately owned. The letter has prompted numerous comparisons to the torturous Brexit negotiations between Theresa May, the European Union, and parliament.Here is the letter:It was described as “an ill-disguised jibe about Mrs May\u0027s habit of keeping her cabinet in the dark about her plans for Brexit” by one newspaper.\u0026nbspOn Twitter many have expressed similar views. “This entire letter is an absolutely masterful trolling of Theresa May,” journalist Thomas Colson wrote.A genuine row has been unfolding in Hastings in recent months after the purchase of the pier which underwent a £14m lottery-funded facelift in 2017 and won it the prestigious Stirling Prize for architecture.Despite a local group crowdfunding £750,000 to take control of the pier when it went into administration, it was sold to Sheikh Abid Gulzar, the owner of Eastbourne pier, for just £60,000, according to Land Registry documents.Since then\u0026nbspit has remained closed for “repairs and improvements”, but was supposed to re-open in March.However, it now appears he is planning to keep the pier closed for longer due to structural concerns.“I urge the owner of Hastings Pier to conduct these repairs as a priority so that the pier may open as soon as possible. Our town cannot keep experiencing delay after delay,” Ms Rudd wrote.Last month Ms Rudd publicly criticised Ms May in an article demanding the prime minister ruled out a no-deal Brexit.The Independent\u0026nbsphas contacted both Ms Rudd\u0027s office and Hastings Pier for comment.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

As of tonight, April\u0026nbsp12th\u0026nbspis the new March 29th.Speaking after the agreement was struck, European Council president Donald Tusk said Ms May “accepts the extension scenarios”.He added: “Frankly speaking I was really sad before our meeting –\u0026nbspnow I am much more optimistic.”European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker added: “This closes and completes the full package. There’s no more we can give. We’re hopeful that the agreement will be adopted by the House of Commons.”I hope we can all agree that we are at the moment of decision, Theresa May said at a press conference in the early hours of the morning.Jeremy Corbyn refuses to rule out revoking Article 50It gives us the opportunity, MPs next week, to look at the choices that clearly face them: we can leave with a deal, in an orderly manner, have that extension until 22 May - or, if we don\u0027t get that deal through, if we don\u0027t get that vote through then before 12 April we have to come forward with another plan, and if that plan means a further extension it means standing in those European Parliamentary elections.At the start of the mammoth Brussels drafting session Theresa May took questions from EU leaders about her Brexit strategy,\u0026nbspwith diplomats privy to discussions describing her responses as unconvincing and wooden.According to several accounts, the prime minister was unable to answer what would happen if she could not pass the vote in parliament and had no apparent plan B, spooking her fellow leaders.After Ms May was sent out of the room, the 27 leaders discussed options for an extension that included dates in April, May, and delays until the end of the year. Both conditional and unconditional extensions were considered by EU leaders.Discussions and drafting of the new plans spilled over into a late night dinner, with a planned meeting about China-EU relations pushed back until Friday. Planned press conferences by Theresa May, Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker were postponed until just before midnight.Leaders ultimately agreed a text which read: “The European Council agrees to extension until 22 May, provided the withdrawal agreement is approved by the House of Commons next week. If the withdrawal agreement is not approved by the House of Commons next week, the European Council\u0026nbspagrees to an extension until 12 April and expects UK to indicate a way forward before this date for consideration by EUCO.”Arriving at the summit in the afternoon Theresa May said the prospect of a delay was “a matter of regret” for her. She also confirmed she would seek an extension until 30 June.On the way into the meeting Emmanuel Macron had perhaps the starkest warning of Ms May’s European counterparts, telling reporters: “We have to be clear: we can discuss and agree an extension if it is a technical extension in the case of a ‘yes’ vote. In the case of a ‘no’ vote, it will guide everybody to a no deal, for sure.”The French president said that a longer delay would require “a deep political change” in the UK, adding: “We cannot have a long-lasting situation where there is no visibility, no purpose, no political majority.”Meanwhile Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar described the situation in London as “somewhat chaotic” and said a no-deal Brexit would be a decision by the UK because it had the power to revoke Article 50.We’ll tell you what’s true.

fresh referendum supporters delighted - while minister floats extraordinary plan to suspend parliament and start a new sessionClick to followIndy PoliticsTheresa May’s hopes of forcing MPs to back\u0026nbspher Brexit deal by staging repeat votes are in tatters, after speaker\u0026nbspJohn Bercow dramatically blocked the tactic, citing rules dating back to before the Gunpowder Plot.The prime minister was left stunned by the shock announcement – which torpedoed her hopes of a third “meaningful vote” while threatening MPs with a long delay to leaving the EU if they refused to give way.The dramatic twist, outlawing fresh votes without substantial changes, left ministers scrabbling for solutions – including an extraordinary proposal to suspend parliament and start a new session.It also achieved the remarkable feat of uniting supporters of a no-deal Brexit and a second referendum, who both believed it made their favoured option more likely.The solicitor general, who warned of “a constitutional crisis”, put forward the escape route of ending the current parliamentary session early to get around the 1604 convention invoked by the speaker, which lapses after a fresh Queen’s Speech.Here’s how Theresa May can get around Bercow’s dramatic Brexit ruling“There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session,” said Robert Buckland.Created with

there are enough supporters of the deal in the first place.There was no immediate official response from Downing Street, other than to express its fury that Mr Bercow gave no warning of his bombshell

convention to stop the government bullying parliament on issues MPs have rejected.Ms May has already admitted that the negotiations with the EU are over, making it hard for her to argue that a further meaningful vote will be on a different question.Crucially, the speaker suggested something would have to be renegotiated with the EU to constitute a “change”, rather than, for example, a clarification of legal advice by the attorney general.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?French EU minister names cat ‘Brexit’ because of its indecisive natureMr Bercow told MPs: “What the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition – or substantially the same proposition – as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes.”The Independent revealed in January that pro-EU MPs believed that Ms May’s tactic to bludgeon her deal through, despite heavy defeats, was barred by parliamentary rules.Senior Tories were livid, believing the speaker had once again laid bare his anti-Brexit bias while twisting constitutional rules to suit his purpose.Rory Stewart, the prisons minister, taunted Mr Bercow by tweeting: “‘When I use a word,’\u0026nbspHumpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean.’”He added: “In the normal course of events, as the speaker says, parliament says no, and the issue is dropped.“But in this case, this is not an option, because these votes respond to an instruction in a referendum, endorsed by parliament, which rules out dropping back to the status quo.”Supporters of a Final Say referendum were delighted, with former Tory MP Anna Soubry telling\u0026nbspThe Independent: “It puts a second referendum very firmly at the top of the agenda –\u0026nbspit must do. We need a way out of this and this is the only way out.”Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister and People’s Vote supporter, said: “It is inconceivable now for ministers to carry on trying to force this broken Brexit deal on the people of the United Kingdom.”And David Lammy, a Labour supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group, said: “If the prime minister wants us to vote on her deal again, she should add an amendment allowing for her deal to be put to the people.”In the short term, the speaker’s intervention killed off any prospect of a third meaningful vote this week – already in doubt as the Democratic Unionist Party failed to switch sides.It appears certain that Ms May will have to ask EU leaders for a long\u0026nbspextension – anything between nine\u0026nbspand 21 months – to the Article 50 process at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.The new departure date will then be put to a “take-it-or-leave-it vote” in the Commons and Lords next week, just days before the 29 March Brexit day.For that reason, it increases the chances of a crash-out Brexit, which the Treasury has predicted could\u0026nbsptrigger a near 10 per cent GDP decline.However, a long extension could also open up the space for a further referendum, which some believe the prime minister might yet embrace if it is the only hope of passing her agreement.Speaking to a silent Commons, Mr Bercow said repeat votes had been blocked on 12 occasions up until 1920 – a situation only not repeated since because of “general compliance”.“This convention is very strong and longstanding, dating back to 2 April 1604,” the speaker said.“It’s a necessary rule to ensure the sensible use of house time and the proper respect for the decision which it takes.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

So far as we’re concerned, we think there’s an urgency in constructing a majority for an agreeable solution and that’s what we’re concentrating on at the moment,” he said when asked about the move.Asked again, he replied: “We think that what we’re proposing can be achieved in the British parliament ... we do believe we can construct a majority which will prevent the crashing out and all the chaos that will come from crashing out.”A Labour spokesperson later confirmed the party’s position: “As we have always said, we respect the result of the referendum and will do whatever is necessary to prevent a no-deal outcome. We do not believe that revoking Article 50 is in any way necessary.”Mr Corbyn visited the de facto EU capital on Thursday at the same time as Theresa May, meeting with senior European Commission officials like Michel Barnier and Martin Selmayr. He also met with senior centre-left prime ministers at their pre-summit gathering.What you need to know about stopping Brexit and revoking Article 50Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable, who is also in the EU capital, told The Independent that he would prefer a new referendum to revoking Article 50, but that MPs “may” have to go ahead with a revocation as a last resort.“It’s a last resort. We prefer a referendum than revocation,” he said. “But if that isn’t possible, parliamentarians may need to revoke article 50 in order to protect the country from no deal.”The European Court of Justice ruled last year that Britain\u0026nbspcould unilaterally revoke Article 50 – effectively ending the Brexit process and keeping the UK in the EU until it was triggered again. A mere extension to the negotiating period, however, requires the consent of the other 27 EU member states.Britain will leave the EU if\u0026nbspthe Article 50 period is allowed to expire – with or without a deal in place.Created with Sketch.

The idea has, however, been given a boost in recent days, after an online petition backing the move\u0026nbsphit around 900,000 signatures and climbing, as of early on Thursday afternoon.Arriving at Thursday’s European Council meeting in Brussels Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said a no-deal would “only ever be a British choice” because the UK has the power to revoke Article 50.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It happens when it rains hard.But this spring, the poppies have been so abundant and so strikingly coloured – orange peel, marigold and burned copper – that the number of people coming to walk among them has simply been too many.\u0026nbspAs a result, the city was forced to say “no” to visitors, after what some officials termed a “super bloom apocalypse”.“The city has expended all available resources to address the #SuperBloom,” they wrote on the the city’s Instagram page. “We have brought in all available staff, as many outside traffic controllers that we could, more shuttles, and our small city can not sustain crowds of this magnitude – our city is not made for Disneyland-size crowds.”It urged residents: “Please, we need your help and understanding. This is beyond our control.

Residents have complained about traffic jams, as visitors have arrived as early as 5.30am to visit the wildflowers, whose burst of growth was triggered by recent record-breaking rainfall. One person was reportedly hurt in a traffic accident.For the last few weeks, crowds have swarmed onto the fields, many ignoring\u0026nbsp instructions that they stay on the designated path. Some have even picked the flowers to take home.\u0026nbspMayor Steve Manos told The Independent he had never known a\u0026nbspbloom as spectacular as the one this year. “It only happens when it rains hard,” he said. “The last one was 2017, and before that it was 2010.”“People were pulled over on the side of the road to see the flowers as we drove here,” she said. “It was amazing to see the number of flowers grow as we got closer.”Mr Manos, mayor of the city located 70 miles to the south east of Los Angeles, posted videos of himself helping direct traffic on Facebook, to try and give an insight into how bad the situation was.\u0026nbspOn Monday morning, amid some criticism over the shutdown, the city said access to Walker Canyon had been reopened, though parking was extremely limited.\u0026nbspMr Manos appeared in another brief video, standing in front of people walking through the footpaths amid the flowers.REDIRECT Nature Studies by Michael McCarthy: A Western Isles idyllWild flowers are overpowered by exhaust fumesBritain’s most common wild flowers are latest species to disappearThe last stand of the wild flower“As you can see, there are a number of people behind me here to experience the bloom.\u0026nbspBut we are full.

I just can’t wrap my head around that one.”Another, Stephanie Kowalski, added: “Thank you for calling this out. The lack of respect is so sad.”But not everyone agreed with the museum’s actions.

We all stand united as brothers and sisters”.Her defiant words are a fitting epitaph for the New Zealand victims: “We must tell them you will not win.”ENOUGH is enough on the Brexit shambles. We want out as soon as possible.A poll today shows that  per cent want PM Theresa May to ignore MPs and leave the EU without a deal.Buther exit plan does not get past Parliament, Britain’s departure could be postponed for two years. As Andrea Leadsom says, a y delay would be humiliating.MPs must unite behind the deal on the table — or waste the chance of a letime to wave goodbye to Brussels.Sort it. Anything  is a betrayal.TRAGIC Jade Goody’s most worthwhile legacy is sadly being squandered.The -year-old’s death from cervical cancer ten years ago was a wake-up call for millions of women. But the smear test rates that shot up after she lost her le have now plummeted to record lows.Backed by this newspaper, the NHS is urging women to take the le-saving test.So our message is don’t delay, go today.

It would be an Establishment stitch-up, with serious consequences for the public’s faith in democracy for decades to come.For those Labour supporters who voted to leave, it’s a reminder that the party’s MPs are desperate to overturn the result of the ‘People’s Vote’ in June .There are some notable exceptions. But the vast majority are determined to frustrate Brexit, regardless of the result of our biggest ever democratic exercise.Labour is now far more interested in north London than the north of England.The threat of Remainers wrecking our departure gets more pressing by the day.Brexiteers must accept reality and back the best Brexit possible: the PM’s deal.MIKE Thalassitis’ suicide is a wake-up call for Britain’s TV companies — and the country at large.Suicide is the single biggest killer of men under  in the UK. But it’s not just blokes. A fth of adolescent girls say they have self-harmed, a path to more serious acts later in le.Britain has come a long way in recent years on mental health. But those statistics show there is plenty of work to do. We’re thrilled to launch our Let’s Talk campaign with Papyrus to do our bit.The pressures of modern le are even more pressing for those who are thrust suddenly into the spotlight.That’s the lesson not just of today’s news but of Love Island star Sophie Gradon’s death last year.The companies that make millions off these young men and women have a duty of care to them. It’s clear from the criticism we’ve seen since Mike’s untimely death that those outfits MUST take their responsibilities more seriously.Chloe Goodman knows better than most. And we back her call for mandatory counselling for reality stars.This tragedy must be the last.FACEBOOK are asking for our gratitude after eventually taking down videos of the horric terrorist attack in Christchurch.Which doesn’t change the fact it took far too long for them to do so, nor that it was streamed in the first place.It is ridiculous that these s continue to dodge the responsibilities that come with being a publisher, even though boss Mark Zuckerberg has admitted that that is exactly what they are.The Government MUST step in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Run for your lives.“But it really isn’t like that.”Oh, OK, you could maybe take your chances listening to her Fanny impression then. Talking of which, This Morning’s Martin Lewis. There’s a strong argument to say he should have been made to do If I Were A Rich Man, from Fiddler On The Roof. And an equally strong one to say he really shouldn’t. But he ended up doing Any Dream Will Do, from Joseph, and oh-my-s**tting dachshund he was bad. Talking point of the night, evenCorrie’s Daniel Brocklebank won, was Alan Titch-marsh singing Some Enchanted Evening, from South Pacic, on a stretch of thoughtfully placed decking.A man overcome with emotion. The main one being anger by the look on his face.Like next door’s kids had just punted their football straight into his prize begonias, it was.The audience went nuts for it, though, the judges were in floods of overwhelmed tears and, must admit, even I was aware I was watching something that would be played again and again, for both good and bad reasons.But I must urge caution here. Antony Cotton got his own ITV chat show after winning Soapstar Superstar.It just needed Simon Cowell tuning in on Sunday, and, before you know it, he’s got Titchmarsh back in the white blazer trying to Dream The Impossible Dream for the Christmas No.Still, we have to look for the positives, and what I’ll ultimately take from All Star Musicals is the fact John Barrowman appeared on telly, for two entire hours, and didn’t shout: “FAB-U-LOUS!” once.Progress. FRIDAY. This Morning’s Eamonn “Rip Van Winkle” Holmes: “If I eat before I go to bed I stand a better chance of falling into a deep sleep. Or am I just odd ”No, you’re corpulent as well.ROMESH Ranganathan broke with  years of Red Nose Day tradition and said something vaguely funny about Four Weddings And A Funeral on Friday night.“As a young Asian kid growing up in Crawley that film really spoke to me.”OK, not belly  laughs, but an acknowledgement that some of us don’t get Four Weddings and think we need a charity sequel about as much as Gregg Wallace needs a hairnet on Inside The Factory.Still, it was a chance to see what the ravages of time have done to almost everyone except Andie MacDowell, who certainly hasn’t spent the past  years taking acting lessons.The lesbian wedding plot was also entirely in keeping with the right-on tone of an event that’s so self-satisfied, starstruck and preachy you can understand why some people think Africa should go it alone rather than submit to Comic Relief’s condescension for all eternity.You’ll have to make your own judgment call on the true value of Red Nose Day, where the night’s grand total has been dropping ever since  and civilians have been almost vanished from the process entirely.Personally, I took inspiration from Sir Lenny Henry’s final words of the night: “See you in two years’ time maybe.”’Cos I heard that “maybe” and thought, “maybe not”. Channel ’s  Hours In Police ­Custody.The “fat ginger” ­playground line on Ricky ­Gervais’ new Netflix ­comedy After Le.Goggleboxer Lee dipping his Doritos in Jenny’s face pack.Scotland’s Finn Russell suddenly deciding he’d given England enough of a head start at - in an enthralling Calcutta Cup match.And Celebs Go Dating civilian Joe asking Love Island’s Georgia Steel, “What do you actually do ” and getting the perfect response  from narrator Rob Beckett: “In summary, f*** all.”b “Down Royal and Downpatrick in Northern Ireland host the racing of what animals ”Matt: “Cows.”Bradley Walsh: “What flying animal is the slang term for doing time in prison ”Rachel: “Monkey.”Bradley Walsh: “The hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah is most associated with which sport ”Shirley: “Fishing.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Colloquially known as ‘Dubya’, President George Bush used which middle initial to distinguish himself from his father ”Jacob: “J.” .CHANNEL ’s hugely entertaining series The Bachelor UK was further proof that men are  from Mars and women are from an as-yet- undiscovered galaxy many thousands of light years away.They seemed surprisingly keen to mate with Alex Marks, though, considering he looked like Captain Haddock with a man-bun, below, and would’ve been the most vacant lot on any planetit wasn’t for the presence of host Mark Wright.He had only one tactic with all of the women as well: Tell them “You’re beautul,” ask for “a hug,” then move in for the kill with Reanne, Robyn, Charlotte T, Charlotte E, mad Georgie the circus performer, and even shark-eyed Essex nightmare Alicia.It was working a treat as well, until Tuesday’s episode, when Alicia found Alex snogging Charlotte T and it all kicked off massively.Reanne took the smartest option available, in the circumstances, by immediately quitting  the show.Alicia  took the dumbest option available, by locking herself in the South African mansion’s bathroom.So she can probably be thankful it wasn’t a celebrity version of the show and Alex is hardly the sharpest tool in  the box.Because the gormless, great oaf  only went and ruined everything by picking Alicia ahead of talented, beautul and much nicer Charlotte T on Thursday night’s final.I’d give it until the end of the credits.INCIDENTALLY,you’re still trying to decide whether Baptiste is great TV or not, it’s not.Andyou don’t believe me, watch next Sunday’s far-fetched finale and try to avoid replying: “Not bloody soon enough” when Stratton screams: “God, when does it end ”Bet you can’t. SORRY. Kazakhstan away.

Then MPs backed a Brexit delay.It’s asthe House of Commons is ­following Tony Blair’s step-by-step guide to overturning the  referendum.A No Deal Brexit will only happen in nine days’ timethe EU refuses an ­extension. That is unlikely.Theresa May will beg for a delay, whatever the conditions.EU members will not want to be blamed for a messy No Deal outcome.From next week, MPs could start voting on their preferred Brexit options through so-called indicative votes. Spoiler alert — they will not end up backing a harder exit.I know there are Leave voters who do not like Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Butyou do not like her deal, look at the alternative options for softer Brexits, which would be far worse for the country.If you think this deal risks the UK ­getting stuck in a customs union, just wait till you see what the deal would look like with Labour’s “permanent” customs union glued on top.Better to have an imperfect route to controlling our own trade policy than no route at all.If you do not like the fact that, under the PM’s deal, we would have to keep existing EU goods and agricultural rules, imagine staying in the Single Market or, as it is rebranded, Common Market .. We would lose the veto over goods rules which we have in the backstop, and be forced to follow rules on services too.Even in a worst-case scenario, Theresa May’s deal lets us escape the EU’s “ever closer union” political project and seize control of our own immigration policy.We would be in control of almost all our economy and not have to pay a penny for it on an ongoing basis.It is far better than most critics will admit. Thanks to changes secured at Strasbourg last week, we have new protections.The EU can no longer do what French President Macron arrogantly threatened. It will not be able to use the backstop as a “trap” to demand access to UK fishing waters.The EU cannot just say “non” to every sensible idea for resolving the Irish border issues. The so-called Star Chamber of MPs were quick to reject the Strasbourg changes.But they should listen to the Irish opposition party.Their Brexit spokesperson said: “We have come a long way” from a “bullet-proof, rock-solid, cast-iron backstop”.Or how about top barrister Lord ­Pannick  He is the QC who won the case for Gina Miller against the Government.He argues that in some circumstances the UK could terminate the deal through the so-called Vienna Convention.Conservative Eurosceptic big beasts, from ex-leader Michael Howard to former Chancellor Norman Lamont, have all weighed in behind the deal.David Davis, who resigned over ­Chequers, is now onside.Lord Trimble, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, has backed it. If he can live with the backstop, that should count for something.But some Eurosceptic back- benchers still refuse to support the PM’s deal.Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, they would prefer a harder deal. But face facts. There is no harder Brexit on offer.With No Deal out of reach, there is no incentive for the EU to provide any more concessions.That means the choices are this deal or a softer Brexit. Or no Brexit at all.And be sure that the Speaker, John Bercow, will bend every possible rule to frustrate Brexit.So, do not expect a long delay to offer a better answer.Anyway, the choice on our future could be made soon.There is no time to lose to save Brexit. Even a snap General Election offers no easy salvation. It would mean Theresa May leading the Tories into another campaign on a manesto of her deal — precisely what her critics want to avoid. And of course, the Conservatives could lose any path to power at all, kissing goodbye to any Brexit.Brexit would never have happenedit had not been for Boris Johnson.Now he has a crucial opportunity to save the whole project.He can show how he can be a ­statesman, by compromising in the national interest.And he can demonstrate the sort of leadership that won him so much praise as Mayor of London.If the Government can persuade the DUP to vote for the deal, backbenchers including Dominic Raab, Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers and Mark Harper should follow suit.Otherwise, they risk being remembered as the MPs who wrecked Brexit, along with Labour MPs who helped trigger ­Article  and then opposed both No Deal and the current deal.Theresa May also needs to recognise that backbenchers want someone  to take forward the next stage of the negotiations.If she tries to cling to power, critics on both sides of the Brexit ide may never back her deal.Whereasshe pledges to step down on getting her deal through, she can step down as a hero who delivered Brexit against the odds.MPs should know that politics is about taking the world as you find it, not as you would like it to be.And leadership is about taking decisions, even when all the choices are unpalatable.It is fine to stick to principle, but notthat means emulating King Canute’s stand against the waves.If Brexit does not happen it will be a ­national democratic calamity.As the party in power, the Conservatives will be punished.That means risking ­letting Jeremy Corbyn — a leader who can not even deal with anti-Semitism in his own party — seize control of the country.The stakes simply could not be higher. If this chance is squandered we will likely never get another moment.Right across Europe, critics of Brussels will think “even Britain couldn’t break free”.Henry Newman is director of the Open Europe think tank.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Maybe to keep up levels of national happiness we should leave horrible, authoritarian bureaucracies every year. Just to put a grin on our faces.

Theresa May is still Prime Minister and we’re currently heading for a Brexit which would be a travesty of the one we voted for in . If we get Brexit at all.Some of the Brexiteers in Parliament think we might still be able to escape the EU with a No Deal, on World Trade Organisation terms. I think they are deluding themselves.Parliament, which is two to one in favour of NOT leaving the EU, simply will not let it happen.And the EU, desperate to retain its market for goods in the UK, will make sure it doesn’t happen, too.Our Brexiteers are right that Theresa May’s deal is awful. Butthey get a chance to vote on it again, they should hold their noses and vote in favour.Because I reckon it’s that or nothing. We will have a delay, the EU may insist we hold a second referendum as a condition of that delay.And trust me, the second referendum will be rigged in favour of remaining in the EU. It will not be a straightforward in or out option. There will be three options, to split the Leave vote down the middle.In this fight to leave the EU, the British people have had everything against them. The EU, obvs. But also the House of Commons and the puffed-up, ludicrous, pro-Remain speaker John Bercow. And the House of Lords, the civil service and the BBC.The lesson for us low-born, powerless Leavers is to take what we can and scarper before the whole idea is killed stone dead. Which I fear it may be.And now Mrs May is heading back to Brussels to plead for a delay in triggering Article .All along she has been too obsessed with the process of leaving the EU, rather than the clear imperative as demanded by the British people — to simply LEAVE the EU, all of it.She has followed Brussels’ agenda at every twist and turn. And she’ll be following it now. She’ll do what the EU wants.So here’s the deal, as I see it. Give her hopeless proposal one more chance and this time vote for it.We will have been cheated, but not as badly aswe do not leave at all.Because the longer this goes on, the more likely that outcome will be.THIS country becomes more deranged by the very hour.A Roman Catholic journalist claims she may face JAIL because she referred to a transgendered person by the sex assigned at birth, rather than the one she now identies as.Caroline Farrow has been told she must attend a police station for a taped interview.She said: “I have pointed out to police that I am a Catholic journalist commentator and it is my religious belief that a person cannot change sex.”Quite.

Such as “zir” and “hir” and the horrible “peoplekind”.I hope they have room next year for these following words I’ve just made up: Togerov – a Bulgarian man who has transitioned to female.Abbottophobia – the irrational fear that Diane is about to appear on the TV talking complete b******s.Droll – an internet troll who is nonetheless quite funny.WYLFWTS– someone on a gender studies or media studies course.

I quickly came to learn that, in relation to Brexit, nothing could be further from the truth.Unfortunately, I must remain anonymous for fear of the backlash I would receive at my place of work.However, I can reveal I am a senior policy professional within the service and work closely with a number of government departments.There are a number of extremely dangerous myths regarding civil servants that I must dispel because of the impact they are having on the Brexit process.MYTH : The civil service is independent. The civil service was founded on the pillars of political neutrality.Civil servants are meant to ensure that their own political persuasions do not affect their work. Crucially, they should accept those from all political leanings and points of view.It has become clear to me that the vast majority of civil servants support Remain.From my observations I would estimate this number to be well over  per cent.This is worrying in itself and far from representative of the  per cent of the people who voted for Brexit.Most horrying, however, is the sheer disdain and utter contempt that my colleagues display towards people who voted to Leave.I have lost count of the number of insulting and derogatory terms that are used in my own department and where to refer to the .million people who voted for Brexit: “Racist”, “stupid”, “uneducated”.Anti-Brexit jokes and snide remarks are dropped casually into everyday office con-versations. I live in fear that my colleagues will discover through a slip of my tongue that I am a Brexiteer.Were this to happen, I believe that most would refuse to talk to me again and I might even lose my job.This entire culture creates a thickening cloud of negativity towards Brexit that shades all areas of the civil service. I have witnessed first-hand civil servants doing everything within their power, subtly and under the surface, to frustrate Brexit and talk it down at every opportunity.This can only seriously undermine our efforts to be in the strongest position possible on leaving the EU.MYTH : Civil servants are experts in their field.One would like to think the iniduals making decisions that affect our entire nation would have some level of skill or experience.If only that were true.For example, I know of one stand-alone “expert” policy team leading our preparations for Brexit.You can imagine my disbelief when I discovered none of its members had worked on anything remotely related to the EU before. In fact, I have discovered over time that the vast majority of “experts” within the service have no expertise whatsoever.In many cases the “portfolio” you take on when you join the service is dictated by the one held by your predecessor.As a result, you have new civil servants inheriting politically sensitive and highly important work without the faintest clue about what they are dealing with.Civil servants who are seriously underperforming will usually have a new job title and position created for them somewhere  in the organisation instead of being sacked or performance-managed — they become someone ’s problem then.Given the influence that civil servants are exerting over the Brexit process, this is truly concerning.MYTH : The civil service does not engage in scaremongering.I had hoped that civil servants, even in times of crisis, would be able to remain calm and level-headed in pursuit of ensuring the best outcomes for our country.And yet it is not uncommon for me to receive emails from colleagues promoting Brexit scare stories that are nothing more than lies and speculation. Recently, things have become so panicked that ious “Brexit contingency” plans have been set up throughout the organisation. This is to prepare for the “national public transport breakdown”, “surge in criminality” and “widespread public unrest” that is going to follow after we leave.These plans also involve collecting the personal details of certain civil servants to put in place a -hour, on-call rota for the “emergency” that is looming. This scare-mongering, created and whipped up by civil servants, is having a marked impact on the confidence and well-being of ordinary citizens.For example, one acquain-tance of mine is so terried by the speculative threats put out by the service they have started to stockpile large quantities of their medication. This needs to stop.MYTH : Ministers are in charge.When I was outside the civil service looking in, I always believed civil servants were there simply to advise their ministers, who, as elected representatives of the people, would make the ultimate decision. However, I have come to realise that ministers are often mere puppets, with civil servants pulling ferociously at their strings.The level of bureaucracy is unimaginable.In my experience parlia-mentary briefings go through — at a minimum — five stages of internal clearance, with crucial information being amended or deleted at every stage on the whim of that inidual civil servant.The power and competence of our ministers is, I’m afraid, a facade.They are nothing more than a megaphone for the views of biased civil servants who lurk behind them in the shadows.I am a supporter of the Leave campaign.To go against the will of the people expressed in the  referendum would be the ultimate act of betrayal.The Government MUST allow us to take back control by leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation terms. If the people are betrayed, I may have no choice but to resign.Honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity. We will soon discover, once and for all, whether our politicians embody these values.©The Sunday Times News Licensing Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Increasing fuel duty would be narrow minded and hit families and businesses right across the country.“Yet again it is clear that,the Labour party were in power, they would punish drivers and ignore the impact this would have for millions of people in the UK.”APD is levied on airline passengers aged  and over who are departing from UK airports.The rate for long-haul passengers is £ in economy and £ in premium seats, with short-haul trips charged at £ in economy and £ in premium.No duty is paid on direct long-haul flights from Northern Ireland.Motoring and aviation groups have called for duty on fuel and flights to be cut, but environmental campaigners say the levels should be increased.AA president Edmund King said motorists “support reasonable measures to improve air quality” but claimed a hike in fuel duty would be “seen as an attack on the economy”.He added: “We need to promote incentives for drivers to switch to greener vehicles rather than looking at measures to tax them more.”RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: “Tax, including VAT, already equates to around two-thirds of the price of a litre so raising fuel duty above its current level of almost p a litre would almost certainly have a very negative impact on the economy.Any move like this would hit those who can least afford it the hardest, particularlythey rely on their cars for getting to work.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is really serious injury.He exposed each of the victims to serious risk.Each one of the offences is so serious only custody is appropriate.Earlier court hearings were told the ear removal was performed in  without anaesthetic, three years after McCarthy split a womans tongue with a scalpel.McCarthy first appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court in , when he initially denied six counts relating to the three procedures.An online petition gained , signatures when it was set up to support the knowledgeable, skillful and hygienic body-piercer, who was refused permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.Following a failed bid to convince a Crown Court judge consent was a lawful defence, McCarthy took the case to the Court of Appeal, arguing what he did should be lawful to protect the personal autonomy of his customers.But three Court of Appeal judges, who noted that McCarthy had split a customers tongue to produce an effect similar to that enjoyed by reptiles, said the procedures were not the same as tattoos and piercings.Although they accepted the ear removal had been done quite well the judges said it was not in the public interest that a person could wound another for no good reason.In a statement issued after McCarthy pleaded guilty, Wolverhampton City Council said Public Protection officers had served a notice preventing him from carrying out extreme services."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004594082961.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"more than half of brits on universal credit have benefits slashed to pay for loans to help them through 5 week wait","story":"Thousands of Brits had hundreds of pounds knocked off their benefits because they had to pay back advances theyd taken out at the start or other debts for housing or bills.New figures revealed yesterday showed that half a million people in October had a deduction to their Universal Credit allowance -  per cent of all claims.Of those people, around half had  per cent knocked off, and one in five had up to a third taken off., claims had more than  per cent of their allowance taken off, a written question to campaigning MP Frank Field showed.Department for Work and Pensions minister Alok Sharma wrote to say: The aim of the deductions policy in Universal Credit is to protect vulnerable claimants from eviction and or having their gas, electricity and water cut off, by providing a last resort repayment method for arrears of these essential services.But MPs have argued that forcing Brits into debt when they move onto the new system is the wrong way to go.The Sun has been campaigning for the five-week wait to be slashed to stop Brits being straddled with extra debts and costs from the very beginning.Approximately  per cent of new claimants opt to take out an advance payment to help them last the five weeks before they can get help.Amber Rudd has made it easier to claim an advance, in order to stop Brits losing their homes or going behind on bills.But shes also admitted that the five-week wait for cash has pushed people into using foodbanks.The Work and Pensions Secretary is taking on a review of the controversial new system to try and make it work.Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Some Brits are also stung for previous over payments on the old system - many of whom are totally unaware that they owed money until its taken off their Universal Credit payment.A DWP spokeswoman said: When claimants have housing or utility arrears, we make deductions from their benefits to help pay off debts and keep them in their homes.Safeguards are in place to ensure that deductions are affordable.Earlier this week MPs revealed they will look into whether Brits are being forced into prostitution because of Universal Credit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000477487236.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"baby born without nose birth defect","story":"The infant was delivered in Fallujah, Iraq, two weeks ago.Medics say the newborn has microcephaly - a condition where the head is smaller than normal, usually because the brain hasnt developed properly.It can be caused by a genetic abnormality, drug or alcohol abuse by the mother, or being exposed to a toxin or virus such as Zika during pregnancy.Images of the newborn were published by Fallujah Birth Defects, which has been documenting congenital malformation in the city, which was heavily bombed during the Iraq war.The organisation said it is the first time they have ever seen a case of microcephaly since setting up in .They said the child, whose gender hasnt been made public, comes from a family who live in a rural area and has three healthy older siblings.Writing in comments on Facebook, the organisation said that the nose deformity was due to a cleft lip and palate and everything  in his body was considered healthy.They added that the youngster was only able to breathe by gasping as the family had refused a tracheotomy, which is where a tube is inserted into the windpipe.In another similar case, an American toddler was born without a nose but died in  at the age of two.Eli Thompson had no nasal passages or sinus cavities - an extremely rare condition known as congenital arhinia - which only affects one in  million births.He had a tracheotomy to help him breathe at only five days old and was able to communicate through sign language.In , he got the chance to meet another child with the same condition - little Tessa Evans from Ireland who was two years old at the time.After the pair met, Tessas mum Grainne said: To get to introduce Tessa to Eli was like a dream come true and it meant the world to us to sit and talk with his family.Tessa was totally taken with Eli and hugged him and stroked his head.

No leaders believe that because the conditions aren’t dferent.The PM was also repeatedly asked by several leaders what she would doMPs voted the deal down.But she was described as “evasive” and “tight-lipped”.Another diplomat added: We’re running out of time and it’s not clear what’s going to happen next.Its % sure leaders will need to come back next week. That will be the real Council. Today is just an appetiser.The two-day leaders’ meeting was supposed to be the last EU summit for Britain in its  years as an EU member – but even that remained unclear.Earlier on arriving in Brussels, Mr Macron turned the screw on MPs to declare there will be “No Deal for sure” in seven days timethey torpedo it for the third and final time on Tuesday.Mr Macron also said a short delayMrs May’s deal passes to give Commons the time to push through all the necessary laws “must be as short as possible”.He added: “In case of a negative British vote, we would go to a No Deal for sure.“We cannot have an excessive extension because it affects our ability to decide and act.“We are ready for Brexit. France didn’t chose this. The British people did.”Luxembourg’s testy PM Xavier Bettel backed him up, saying: “You decided to leave - you want us to be the bad guy - we are not in a souk where we are going to be bargaining for the next five years”.Traders took fright at Mr Macron’s words, and the Pound fell by one per cent against the Dollar, leaving it worth . at the end of the day.But Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel took a far softer line, and vowed before the summit started to fight until the last hour to try and ensure Britain doesnt leave the European Union without a deal.In a clear hint that she would be ready to then offer a longer delay, Mrs Merkel added: “We will work until the last day — I will say until the last hour — to ensure that this emergency planning doesnt come into effect.“We will do everything in the remaining, admittedly few, days to achieve an orderly, joint solution.In a sign of the trouble ahead, Mrs May hastily arranged a meeting with Mr Macron for the summit’s margins.She also had a bilateral meeting with Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Under EU law, the decision to delay Brexit has to be taken unanimously by Mrs May and all  other EU leaders.Asked when the EU would run out of patience with the Brexit saga, EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker joked: I didn’t even know I had this much patience.Earlier yesterday, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned MPs the only other alternativethey reject the deal again will be a long delay with tough conditions from the EU such as a second referendum.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We definitely won’t leave on March , whether or not MPs back Theresa May ’s agreement next week.In a midnight press conference after furious behind-the-scenes wrangling - and the rare sight of hot disagreement within the EU - European Council President Donald Tusk said he is “much more optimistic” about the future. But there are still huge unanswered questions and a political crisis in the UK. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned we could yet face a long delay “to the very end”. And Mr Tusk said there’s still “a lot of space” in hell for Brexiteers in the UK Parliament.What have the EU and UK agreed  The EU has agreed to grant a delay to Brexit. For now the delay will either be short, or really short, depending on the circumstances. However, there could be a second far longer delay imposed in three weeksapos time. It all hinges on whether or not MPs back Theresa May’s Brexit deal in the House of Commons next week.  There will be an extension of Brexit until May . This date is signicant because it is just before the European Parliament holds its elections. .  The idea is the two-month extension will give enough time to pass the hundreds of laws necessary in the UK to leave the EU in an orderly, managed way. The dealgives us a “transition period” where EU laws carry over much as they do now until  December . During that time, we would negotiate a future trade relationship.  In this situation - seen as far more likely - there will be a tiny extension of Brexit until just April . This date is signicant because it’s the deadline to start the paperwork for entering European Parliament elections. In this short time the UK faces an emergency European Council summit - and an incredibly hard set of choices. In this situation, according to EU chief Donald Tusk, the UK has four choices:It agrees the deal after all It leaves the EU with No Deal It revokes Article  to cancel Brexit Or it puts forward a dferent plan to get a “long extension” - which would mean taking part in EU elections. Theresa May essentially backs options  or . She said she does not support revoking Article , an idea backed by more than million people in a petition.  And said “it would be wrong” to take part in EU elections required by a long extension, though she did not rule them out. There has been speculation she could resign in a long extension. And tonight Juncker warned that extension would be “to the very end” a phrase that will leave Brexiteer Tories enraged. She said there was a “clear choice” open to MPs to pass her deal and ensure Brexit happens.  The summit rubber-stamped the so-called ‘Strasbourg Agreement’ - the deal from earlier this month giving “legally binding assurances” that the Irish backstop, a clause in the -page deal that could trap the UK under EU customs rules, will not be permanent. However, those same assurances were labelled as not a legal guarantee by the Attorney General. They’ve already been defeated by  votes. So they’re unlikely to win MPs round next week.  No. She wanted a delay until June  -MPs approved her deal. But said nothing about what would happenthey didn’t. After an address to EU leaders brutally described as “ minutes of nothing”, they took the decision out of her hands. With May out the room, EU leaders thrashed out their own two-way plan for a conditional delay.  They disagreed and the negotiation took many twists and turns, but eventually the plan above was agreed.What happens now  MPs are set to vote probably on Tuesday on the Brexit deal - for the third time.  If it’s voted down expect a furious series of events to unfold in Parliament and between Britain and the EU. There will be an emergency EU summit and possible “indicative votes” for the House of Commons to find the way forward.The EU has insisted it will not give any more on its deal - and “emergency plans” are in place for a No Deal Brexit .Juncker said: “This closes and completes the full package. There is no more we can give. “We’re ready for every eventuality including No Deal. We’re ready and we’ve been ready since . “Emergency measures are in place and we’re continuing to prepare.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit eu draws up plan","story":"NewsBrexit: EU draws up new timetable after Theresa Mays unconvincing extension pleaThe Prime Minister is facing stark warnings of a national emergency as Britain edges closer to a chaotic no dealShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editorPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video theresa-may-am-not-prepared-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May was forced by fed-up EU leaders to delay Brexit until May  last night - but on the condition she gets her deal through the Commons next week. At a dramatic Brussels summit, they also insisted on a new clf-edge of April  , as expected, MPs vote her plan down for a third time.The Prime Minister will be able to get a much longer extension, possibly to the end of the year,she then decides to hold European elections. If she doesn’t, the UK will crash out.“I hope we can all agree, we are now at the moment of decision,” she said. EU leaders were locked in talks late last night over theof the extension, with Mrs May left to dine alone as they carved up Britain’s future without her.    But the dates on offer were far shorter than Mrs May had asked for. She had begged for a delay until the end of June to try to get her deal through. Brussels sources claimed she was “not convincing” when she addressed EU leaders and insisted that her deal could still be passed, and that she failed to set out a plan B. Asked how long the “long extension” eventually on offer to the UK could be, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker replied: “Until the very end.” Mrs May stressed her opposition to the EU poll - but did not rule out that it could happen. “I believe strongly that it would be wrong to ask people in the UK to participate in the elections three years after voting to leave the EU,” she said.    In a major climbdown, she also conceded that Parliament could end up taking control of the process.A cross-party group of MPs have already announced plans for a series of votes on alternative plans next Wednesday. Tory Brexiteers are likely to be furious that Mrs May has opened the door to a longer delay - or Brexit no happening at all.But with just seven days to go until Brexit, fears were rising that Mrs May could be willing to swing behind a catastrophic No Deal Brexithers falls once again.Unions and business leaders have warned Theresa May about a looming national emergency as Britain edges closer to a no-deal Brexit. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady and CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn urged the PM to take swt action to protect jobs and rights. In a joint letter to Mrs May, they demanded she avoids a no-deal exit and comes up with a plan B.  They said: “Our country is facing a national emergency. The shock to our economy would be felt by generations to come... “Decisions of recent days have caused the risk of no deal to soar. Firms and communities across the UK are not ready for this outcome.” It comes as it emerged military planning for a no-deal has begun in a nuclear bunker under the Ministry of Defence. Around , troops are on standby as part of Operation Redfold. Mrs May’s chances of her getting her deal through the Commons still look remote as MPs reacted furiously to her attempts to blame them for her own chaotic handling of the Brexit process.Her own chief whip, Julian Smith, was reported to have openly admitted he found the statement “appalling”. The televised message was also described as a “low blow” by former Tory minister Sam Gyimah.Labour MPs in Leave seats, who she needs to get her deal through, appeared to be backing away. Wigan MP Lisa Nandy said: “There’s absolutely no chance she is going to win over MPs in sufficient numbers after that statement. “I will not support a Government that takes such a reckless, dangerous approach.”    Mrs May, asked last night whether she would apologise for trying to sht the blame onto MPs, offered a partial climbdown - but it was unlikely to be enough. She said: “There are passionately held views on all sides of this argument “Last night I expressed my frustration and know they are frustrated too. MPs have a dficult job to do.” Tory Brexiteers were also bolstered by the belief that a short delay made a no-deal Brexit more likely.Some who switched to back her deal last week were considering U-turning to oppose it again. As leaders arrived at the Brussels summit, EU leaders had stark words of warning for the PM. French President Emmanuel Macron said it was heading for no-deal should MPs reject Mrs May’s plan again. Irish PM Leo Varadkar said “no-deal,it happens, will be a British choice and a British decision”.  A petition to cancel Brexit has already received over . million signatures just a day after it was started. The official Parliament petition website crashed several times yesterday because of the volume of people adding their names. The petition, set up by Margaret Anne Georgiadou, to revoke Article  has been backed by celebrities including actor Hugh Grant and scientist Brian Cox. Independent Group MP Heidi Allen also signed it and, more surprisingly, Camilla Cavendish who was the Director of Policy for then prime minister David Cameron. Petitions that secure , signatures receive an official response, while those that gain more than , signatures have to be debated.

We’re not running down the clock, we’re looking for solutions”.But Mr Corbyn revealed the only way Labour would back the PM’s deal wasshe agreed to move towards a softer Brexit. “If she could say she’s prepared to understand what we’re saying, the points we’re making about the future - customs union, dynamic relationship with Europe - then we will be able to talk to her about that,” he said. “She’s got to move forward on how things can change.” After talks in Brussels, Mr Corbyn warned that Left-wing EU leaders were “frustrated” with Mrs May’s handling of Brexit and “anxious” about the UK crashing out by accident. “It’s a very real threat obviously and it’s made worse by the PM preicating,” he said. “I’m very clear where the responsibility lies for where we’ve got to. I feel very, very worried indeed.”    But the Labour leader was hopeful that a cross-party group of MPs would agree a Norway Plus-style alternative this weekMrs May’s plan is defeated again, to prevent a No Deal. “I think Parliament will come to an agreement next week to stop that happening and we will do everything we can to help them,” he said. “The dangers of a chaotic exit are huge, on supplies, investment, jobs and everything .” Labour will support MPs getting a say over the way forward on Brexit on Monday. The party will then back a cross-party amendment focused on the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU, as well as workers’ rights. But it remains unclear whether there is a consensus in Parliament around a softer Brexit.The smaller opposition parties, including the SNP and the Lib Dems, are opposed to leaving the EU in any form and want a second referendum instead.But Tory Remainers working on a dferent way forward are opposed to a public vote. Mr Corbyn insisted: “I do believe that we can get there”.  He claimed his fellow leaders “get it” that Brexit is happening irrespective and “fully understand” the dangers of No Deal. And he said that Labour, which officially has kept a second referendum on the table despite Mr Corbyn’s private misgivings, would “certainly do our best to meet them” on a fresh vote. The Labour leader admitted striking a balance between referendum-supporting Labour MPs and members, and Leave voters who backed the party at the last election, was sometimes dficult. “I realise the tensions and I realise the pressures. My purpose is to prevent No Deal, to bring people together and keep the Labour Party together,” he said. “Of course it’s complicated but we weren’t sent into this le to have an easy time.”    He defended his decision to boycott a cross-party meeting convened by the PM because former Labour MP Chuka Umunna was there to represent the Independent group. Mrs May had earlier offered him a one-on-one but the No  talks had ended up “pretty chaotic”. He said: “I’ll be meeting her one Monday morning. I think it’s correct that the Leader of the Opposition should have an opportunity to meet the Prime Minister.” Mr Corbyn revealed that nothing keeps him awake at night - even Brexit. “I’m a very good sleeper,” he said. “At the end of the day I listen to a bit of music and I read a book.” He admitted concerns over the PM’s No  statement that blamed “indulgent” MPs for the chaos. “Children over-indulge themselves eating jellies at a birthday party. Parliament’s job is to hold Government to account... that’s what MPs are elected to do,” he said. “The fact that Parliament has comprehensively disagreed with her on many occasions doesn’t mean Parliament isn’t doing its job, it means it’s saying that what she’s proposing is unacceptable.” He agreed with some Labour MPs who have claimed the PM’s words had increased the risk of threats. Conceding that the approach was almost like Donald Trump, he added: “I don’t want to bring him into it, but yes, it’s this idea that you just attack somebody as having somehow or other bad motives when they’re making a political view known because they know her deal is not good.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labours lloyd russell moyle grabbed","story":"NewsLabour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle grabbed by Brexiteer who branded MPs traitorsThe Labour MP says the man tried to hit him and bent his glassesShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video labour-mp-assaulted-street-brexiteer-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA Labour MP says a Brexiteer tried to assault him, branding MPs traitors.

New Zealand’s Labour prime minister rose magnicently to the occasion when a hate-crazed assassin struck in Christchurch, killing  Muslim worshippers.

This slightly-built, witheringly articulate woman who was only named her party’s leader the month before becoming PM in , spoke for her nation asshe had been born for such a challenge.    Compare her handling of a national crisis with Theresa May’s ham-fisted, ­incoherent command of Brexit. The contrast is embarrassing. Mrs May is a politician’s politician: more than two decades as an MP, chairwoman of the Tory Party, holder of a string of ministerial offices and six years as Home Secretary, before taking over from David Cameron as PM in . But she’s not a natural leader. Jacinda is, and it shows. A one-time policy adviser to Tony Blair, this -year-old starter-premier could tell veteran Theresa a thing or two about doing the job. Like how to conduct ­yourself with people.    Mrs May is gauche, wooden and lacking in empathy. She came late to the Grenfell fire tragedy, and failed to win hearts and minds. Mrs Kiwi gets in there, talks the talk with victims’ families, and then walks the walk with tough new curbs on gun ownership. You can tell she gets it. If only we could get her, or somebody like her, to lead us out of this chaos. Time is running short. Mrs May signals she’s had enough, and might quit in the summer. No other person in her party is fit to succeed her, which is not surprising: there’s no such thing as a Tory Jacinda.

Much of the coordination is being done via social media and WhatsApp. The aposGreat British road blockapos national page said: Dishonourable MPs blocked our freedom date of March  so we will start blocking planes, trains and roads. Organisers of the south Wales protests said: Whilst we appreciate that this event will cause some disruption, we firmly believe, weighted against why we are feeling obliged to take such action, that this is now our only course of action.    A Highways England spokesman previously said they were aware of planned protests, before adding: Our focus is on providing a safe, reliable network for the millions of drivers who use our motorways and major A roads every day.

The story heaposs referring to was published in the Times last Saturday, about Primitive, a -year-old Tutsi survivor and Pascal, a -year-old Hutu.    Mr Graham attributed the murders to the Hutu on the right.

But you know what we’re sick of chatting about  Brexit .It was all supposed to be sorted by now - and quite frankly, it was boring to begin with. But since it’s dragging its heels - and could be going on even longer than we feared - British chit-chatters are being forced to talk about subjects normally off limits, on grounds of taste and embarrassment. Here’s some of the topics of conversation that, while awkward or tedious, still seem more riveting than Brexit at this point.Climate Change The almost inevitable fiery death of our planet  Rising oceans and apocalyptic storms  The certain death of every human, animal and plant - and the demise of millions of years of human history and culture, like so much ash blowing away on the wind Yep, still more fun than talking about the Northern Ireland Backstop.ReligionThe classic ‘never bring this up on a first date’ subject. It’s fraught with danger - from setting up articial barriers with a potential partner, to finding out you’ve just bought a gin and slim for a member of the Church of Scientology.    But ask me whether I’d rather start a love affair with a question about god, or spend time discussing ‘that nice Nigel Farage fellow, he’s just saying what everyone  is thinking’ with an elderly relative  Hand us the bible, babes.Sex As a nation we are prudish folk. Many of us would be utterly mortied to be forced to discuss the ins and outs of our bedroom encounters. Mainly for fear of finding out we’d been doing it wrong all these years, I think. But even the most puritanical Brit would rather wax lyrical about their deepest boudoir secrets than debate the relative merits of deal or no deal.Whether cream or jam goes on firstWars have been started over lesser disagreements than the construction of the great British cream tea scone. Itaposs half the reason Cornwall would like to be an independent state, as we understand it.    But that is nothing - NOTHING - compared to the furious rows that can explode from the question “ the Leave campaign cheated, shouldn’t we have a do-over ”Other people’s babies “Oh, you’ll never guess what darling little Olivia did yesterday, it was the absolute cutest thing ever. She put, like, her entire fist in her mouth and made this gurgly, dribbling sound. Hang on, I’ve got a video of it on my phone.” We love our offspring. But even babies that belong to us are often boring. We don’t want to talk about infants for which we have no responsibility. But we’d still rather chat about how many teeth little Jack has got now than how much we’ll be paying Brussels in the orce settlement.Interior design“Hey man, that’s a great shelving unit - where’s it from ” “Ikea.” “Nice. Love your sofa too. The way it transforms into a full-size double bed is just so convenient and innovative! Where’s it from ” “Ikea.” We all love looking at pictures of lovely rooms on Pinterest and flicking through catalogues of dining tables we will never be able to afford. But we do that alone. Interior design is not a fun group chat topic.  Still less bleak than talking about the Political Declaration on the Future Relationship.Your holiday snaps I didn’t go on your holiday. It doesn’t look like the kind of holiday I would enjoy. Iceland doesn’t seem to have any beaches, just luke-warm rock pools and knitting.But we would sit through a three-hour slideshow of all the fun things you and the weirdo youaposre dating did during your magical fortnight in Reykjavik - including your blurry, underexposed pictures of the Northern Lights.

The sale, is one of the most popular across high-street stores, with shoppers known to camp outside larger Next stores during the early hours of the morning in order to make sure they can get first dibs on any sale items. Whopping reductions are expected - and that means big queues and a fight to get the best deals. The Liverpool Echo have spoken to a former employee for advice and top tips on how to grab the best deal for the sale which is expected to attract thousands. When is the Next summer sale  For  the Next spring sale is expected to start in store on Saturday March . The store usually opens at am on the first day of the sale.    When is the best time to go to the sale  Believe it or not, mid-morning is the best time to go, according to a former Next expert, who did not wish to be named. He said: Personally I would hold off from queueing unless there is something in particular you are desperate to get or unless you need a whole new wardrobe. If you are looking to queue I would say from .am or am for Liverpool. Try and have a rough idea of what you want - just because a top isnapost in the top section doesnapost mean we haven’t got it, it could mean it’s been dropped by a customer where. What sells out first  The home section, womenswear and kids tend to sell out first.    Customers go crazy in the morning, said a former Next staff member. The home section gets really good stuff, it can go less than half price. But with the furniture sale I would hold off for a few days because they normally drop again in price by five per cent each week. So a sofa that’s been dropped from £ to £ that’s just not sold in two weeks time then it will be dropped again in price. How can you spot a potential sale item before it hits stores  It is easy for staff to recognise whataposs going to be in the sale but is it for customers  Well, the trick may be in looking out for the small notes on the barcode. You can always tell what’s going to be in the sale, said an ex-staff member.    Staff write a letter and number in pen or pencil next to the barcode. For example say a t-shirt may have R on it that would mean red and £. Sothe barcode has a small letter and number written on two weeks before the sale it usually means itaposs going to be in there. Some customers may not realise that we do get stock in, some customerssale items later that day too. Other top tips  Here are some other top tips from a former Next expert:Be nice to staff - we have got sale stuff in the back, some customers used to speak to us poorly which didnapost make us want to help them but we will always try and do our best. Bring water - You need water, it gets really hot. We once had a woman fall and a child faint and be sick, so be careful.

Tom had already grieved for Susan long before she passed away, learning the exact date of her death months previously when she booked into Dignitas.Susan had suffered with multiple sclerosis for the majority of her le, was blind and had battled breast cancer.Although the hardest part was letting his beloved mum, , go, he knew she needed to be in control.  And he says although he doesnapost regret the process, he backs a law change so families donapost experience the fear he did. Tom, , from Fleet, Hampshire, said: It scared the le out of me. Especially afterwards. The day mum died Dignitas said you should move hotels in case anything happens. From the minute mum died, the level of fear tripled. Now Iaposm in a country where sheaposs done it, the letters she posted to friends and family have been delivered... it started getting known.  And landing back in the UK, at the airport it was like aposletaposs get off the plane, lets get through passport and each bit of passport control, customs and walking into arrivalsapos, my stress levels were so high. Tom had helped his mum commit suicide - something which UK law forbid - and he was worried about hat would happen when he ed from what he sees as helping his mum take back control. And heaposs not alone in his fear Geoffrey Whaley wanted to die before his Motor Neurone disease took hold, so like Susan, he went to Dignitas to end his le. He released an open letter addressed to MPs denouncing the UK laws on assisted suicide and pleading with them to change the law after his we was interviewed by police over his death. Tom was worried about criminal repercussions but put on a brave face as he knew it was what his mum wanted.    Ever since Tom was  and living with his grandparents after his mumaposs health declined, Dignitas had been discussed. He said: It was dficult when she first brought it up because there wasnapost much information. Not everyone had access to the internet, I remember the early days in the late s looking online and the Dignitas website wasnapost even converted into English. There were certain bits you just couldnapost understand - it was so secretive. It was a taboo subject, a criminal activity. For all of our lives, and still today, you are looking at a process where you are meant to feel like a criminal. But in  as the pair ate lunch Susan told Tom sheaposd had enough. At first, Tom thought she meant the food - but then realised she was talking about ending her le. Although at first he was against the idea, Tom realised it was what his mum wanted and supported her. He said: It is the most scariest thing.    From the moment me and mum sat down and said aposyeah, letaposs do thisapos, because of the law and the fear of what youaposve read and the law, we didnapost tell anybody. For the beginning part it was only myself and my other half who knew. She didnapost tell her sister, she didnapost tell her mum, she didnapost tell anybody until she was much further down the line. It claimed such a fear in us. Tom went online and started the process, desperate for his mum to get the green light. Eventually that day came and Susan was told her date was April . . Tom says an additional fear for him was that she may be stopped at the airport, or by the doctors at Dignitas from going through with it. But Susan was determined to make memories for Tom in her last months of le.  They went to the theatre and Tom took her drinking in gay bars in London. He said: Mum spent the three months beforehand building me so many memories in places I liked. It keeps me going, she did it with me. I remember sitting at the airport, weaposd had breakfast and I was flapping about trying to keep busy. It was unreal. The scary bit is you see a doctor twice in Switzerland, he may not approve you, you may come back as a three. Deep down I knew mum wasnapost coming back and it was just so unreal - she wanted it, sheaposd lost her sight, use of her arms and legs and mobility. This was the last bit of control she had left. He said it was a bizarre feeling knowing his mum wasnapost coming home with him but was determined to be as positive as possible. Tom said: We had a bloody good time in the first two days. We laughed, did stuff, saw places.  This is going to be the worst holiday of our lives, letaposs have fun. And even though Tom knew deep down his mum wouldnapost be coming on the flight home, the fear of being caught made him book her a seat anyway. He said: The fear said book a flight out and back - you have every opportunity to show itaposs just a holiday. We got to the airport to fly home without her and they said is Susan checking in  I said no, they asked again. I was sure. They said, aposhow can you know she wonapost apos I said, aposIaposm sure. I just know she wonapost make this flightapos. We were just laughing. Tom said the added pressure of fearing repercussions made him grieve in a dferent way, fearing talking about his mumaposs death to anyone because he felt judged. He said: At the end of the day, itaposs not about hurting those who are vulnerable, itaposs letting people take back control. Mum got the ending she wanted. She was in Switzerland until we came and got her. Susanaposs stance on dying with dignity lives on her gravestone, which is engraved with To Live with Dignity, To Die with Dignity.

But, like Richard III, he would have given his kingdom for a horse to ride in yesterday’s th anniversary event. A record field of  runners and riders turned out to celebrate the quintennial competition in brilliant sunshine on the Yorkshire Wolds. The challenge is a thrilling gallop in the world’s oldest continuously-run race, across four miles of farm tracks and country lanes. The winner’s reward is scarcely regal - nobbut your name on a silver horse cup and fty quid, with the wildcard hazard of runner-up scooping the pool of entry fees.  This is horse-racing, but not as Ascot or Aintree knows it. No advance registration of mounts, no famous jockeys and no upfront betting odds: just turn up, weigh up, saddle up and they’re off!From the air, it would have looked like a festival of flat caps. At ground level, a celebration of tweed. Rural East Riding at its most farming traditional. Jeremy Corbyn would hardly have been recognised.Under a cloudless sky, riders had the public indignity of weighing in to ensure they were at least ten stone. Some underweight competitors slip lead weights into their clothes to meet the target. Hundreds gathered in classic David Hockney country to watch this extraordinary event. The horses were as coloured and ied as their names: Red Panther, Harry, Matty, Asia, The Duchess, Chocobox, The World’s Worst. Favourites of home stables, all.    The ancient rule - “whosoever doth stop or stay any of the horses that rideth for this prize...shall win no prize” is read out. Then they hacked down the course to the starting point before belting back to the finishing line. The whole affair takes not much more than ten minutes. Some of these thoroughbred horses looked suspiciously like they had last seen grass at Cheltenham. I counted them out and counted them in. No falls this year, all safely home, though riders count this a dangerous as well as thrilling competition. Tracey Corrigan was first home by several s on Frog, romping away from Jason Carver on StartMeUp. Tracey, a local huntswoman, hugged her horse. “He’s my boy. He’s my man. He thinks I’m his mother. We have a super relationship. I call him Frog because he’s French. Andyou kiss him he turns into a prince. “I’m very proud. I’m a happy hacker, and I don’t like to lose. People don’t believe me but second is first loser in my house. I was looking for a new home for Frog, but I might change my mind now.    Runner-up Jason, a lithe enthusiast looks the part more than most, with blue and white jockey’s colours told a fellow-rider: “I thought we had a chance about a mile out, but no.” The one-time winner of the Newmarket Town Plate, the longest race in the country, he assured me, would have been entitled to hundreds of pounds as runner-up taking all the £. entry fees bar the money for the prize. He was cheered for handing the cash back to the Injured Jockeys Fund. Tracey is now a four-times winner, having come first in ,  and . She was on short odds – - with the sole course bookie Chris Johnson, who comes here every year from Doncaster. “I don’t usually take much but this year looks promising.” He watches theweigh-in where riders are checked to seetheir weight has slipped below ten stones “so there’s no skulduggery.” Nothing of that sort here. This is Tyke territory, not Jilly Cooper country. “Craps odds!” mumbles a racegoer behind me. In fact, from - to -, minimum stake £, maximum £.    The cash had rolled in. I’d bet £ to win on Pudding, ridden by Becky Oxley, assuming the name had something to do with Yorkshire’s finest dish. “Oh no, I call him that because he was a bit fat when I bought him. I trimmed him down but Pudding was his pet name and it just stuck.” Tradition dictates thatthe course is not completed in any one year, then the Derby dies. Last year, it had to be cancelled because off-road vandals damaged the course.    So sole rider Stephen Crawford and his mount Firkin walked the route to comply with Rule  that says for the race to continue, an inidual and his mount must complete the course after being weighed in. The ancient rules state: “A horse race to be observed and ridd yearly on the third Thursday of March, open to horses of all ages, to convey horsemen’s weight, ten stones, exclusive of saddle, to enter ye post before eleven o’clock on the morning of ye race. The race to be run before two.”    They came from far and wide, well, much of Hockney country anyway Rebecca Wood, , and her one year-old son Douglas were there to cheer on Dougal. “It’s the first year I’ve been. It’s nice to bring children. In the grass sat two young women and an infant with a placard for their horse. Little cameos like that abound, old England in the sticks, just like it should be. As for my winning ways, the odds on Pudding ened from  to - before they even broke into a sweat. He came in very low down the field. “I told you not to back him,” said Becky, . So what went wrong  “He had to stop to talk to somebody. I didn’t want to do it but it was the th. He won’t be doing it again.” But others will. “The Derby will still be here in another five hundred years,” insists Tracey. “It’s a shame we won’t be.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman stops using steroid cream","story":"NewsWoman stops using steroid cream for eczema and embraces natural inflamed skinLaurie Williams le was taken over by eczema for years until she decided to scrap the steroids and antihistamines in favour of a vegan dietShareCommentsByAlyce Collins:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video what-eczema-find-out-dr-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman who had suffered from eczema for as long as she can remember has given up all treatments in a bid to embrace her natural inflamed skin. Before eczema took over Laurie Williamsapos le, she could treat minor flare-ups with E cream and summer sunshine, but it got increasingly worse spreading to around  per cent of her body, including her face. The events planner from Birmingham ended up being prescribed steroid cream to use twice a day, and was later given antihistamines as she was losing sleep due to her scratching.  Iaposve had eczema since I was little, but itaposs always been manageable with flare ups mostly in winter, said Laurie. The furthest back I can remember is when I was about eight years old and I just had it in the creases of my arms and legs.    I now have small scars all over my body from where Iaposve scratched, and the cut has been so deep and was scratched so many times in the same spot that Iaposve scarred my skin. After not seeing much improvement by the end of last summer, the -year-old started researching topical steroid withdrawalafter spotting people on Instagram warning others of the dangers of what she was applying. In January  Laurie stopped using all steroids and creams in favour of treating her skin naturally. The withdrawal caused Laurieaposs skin to become broken and flaky, leading her to cancel social engagements out of fear of people seeing her skin. Iaposve stripped everything back to basics and Iaposve been vegan since the new year, I have oat baths every two days and no longer slather my body with moisturiser, she continued.    I am also taking daily vitamins, D, zinc, selenium and acidophilus and drinking lots of juice. I actively avoid taking any paracetamol, which seems drastic, but Iaposd rather find the underlying cause of my problems and treat it myself rather than masking the symptoms. My sleep was disrupted every night without doubt as Iaposd wake up and scratch for about  minutes, five times a night. I have never been a sweater, but I am sweating like mad through the night because of TSW. When I first came off steroids, I couldnapost get warm. Iaposd sit at work with a cup of tea, my coat on all day and a heater by me and Iaposd still be cold and shivering. My skin was so broken, so it wasnapost retaining heat. Iaposd also feel weak and my legs would shake.    People double take when they see me now, but thataposs only natural, and some ask me whataposs happened to my face and skin.

Experts said the study, published in journal Science, was a major step towards developing fertility-restoring treatments for boys who undergo potentially sterilising procedures. Treatments like chemotherapy can lead to infertility and, while it is possible for men to freeze their sperm ahead of treatment, pre-pubescent males are too young to produce it. The scientists, from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, removed a testis from five young rhesus macaques and froze the testicular tissue. The animals then underwent chemotherapy.    As the animals approached puberty, the researchers thawed the tissue samples and implanted them back in the animals, along with fresh tissue from the remaining testis. The team found that after a few months, the tissue had produced sperm, which was used to generate embryos and transferred to females. Grady, a healthy female rhesus macaque, was born in April . Dr Adetunji Fayomi, one of the studyaposs authors, said: With Gradyaposs birth, we were able to show proof-of-principle that we can cryopreserve pre-pubertal testicular tissue, and later use it to restore fertility as an adult. Dr Kyle Orwig, the studyaposs senior author, added: This advance is an important step toward offering young cancer patients around the world a chance at having a family in the future. Dr Rod Mitchell, from the University of Edinburgh, said: This study represents a major step towards developing treatments for restoring fertility potential in boys facing sterilising cancer treatment.    Since , we have been freezing and storing testicular tissue in boys at high risk of future infertility as a result of their cancer treatment. This study provides proof-of-principle for restoring fertility potential in these boys when they reach adulthood. This is the first primate study to show that pre-pubertal testicular tissue can be successfully removed, cryopreserved and re-transplanted, resulting in the development of sperm that can generate a live birth. Whilst translation of this approach into humans will require carefully conducted clinical studies, for young boys currently having their testicular tissue cryopreserved these results provide genuine optimism for their future fertility.

One woman has managed to combine her love for these things, along with her passion for Disney, and turn it into a dream job. AJ Wolfe lives in Texas with her family and is the creator of Disney Food Blog, a thriving site which features the most comprehensive inventory of the food options currently available at Disney theme parks.What this means, is that she literally makes a living by trying and reviewing all the incredible, magical looking food at Disney theme parks.  Wolfe recently opened up about running the successful blog, as well as ious social media s including a popular Instagram account, Twitter, Facebook and a YouTube channel.She recalls first being interested in Disney food around , but not being able to find a single place that covered it in depth, so she decided to take matters into her own hands. Speaking to People, she said: There was almost a stigma attached to talking about food because people thought it was weird to care so much about Disney restaurants. I remember thinking aposWill people read this  Is that going to be weird apos    But her worries were for nothing as people quickly became obsessed with her blog and the unbiased reviews she shared on it, of everything from dole whip to Mickey bars and purple churros. Even Disney took note of what she was saying. She explained: [The parks] have some iconic foods that people are addicted to, and thataposs a big part of their vacation. Quickly we started to see Disney catch on and realise that food was a part of the destination.    What started as her own pet project  years ago has spiralled with millions of monthly readers and , followers on the aposgram- and she now has the power to make food items at Disney World go viral. Just one photo shared by the blogger can spark a craze, with visitors to the theme parks desperate to try it too, be it a character-themed cupcake, milkshake or cocktail. She is also now able to sustain herself through advertising and sales of her Disney Food Blog dining guides. But despite the success Wolfe still tries to keep a low profile online, avoiding sharing photos of her face so that staff at Disney donapost work out who she is and try to give her special treatment or free food. Instead she insists upon paying for every item herself.   So what does a working day look like for Wolfe  Mostly she manages the website from home in Dallas, but she also has staff based in Calornia who help out and are close to the parks. As well as this, she visits Disney World in Orlando monthly to make sure sheaposs up to date on the food scene. She travels alone and claims her Disney days can last from am until am, taking in four to five meals throughout the day - and she also makes sure to leave a bit of time to go on the rides. Wolfe adds: I started the blog because I love the parks. They just carry a real enchantment for me. I always like to build in time for myself to hang out in the parks and ride some rides. Thataposs part of the benefit of doing this job.

I thought that was too much time added on but, having said that, it’s not the reason,” he said.“We had a great opportunity on the counter attack with two minutes to go and we’ve got to be better.“That’s the reason we are where we are because we’ve been going into so many good areas in each of the last few games and we’re not punishing teams.“We didn’t do what Celtic did. They were ruthless and that’s why we’ve not picked up enough points since I’ve come.“There has been plenty of positive play, plenty of areas we’ve got into but we need to be better in the final third.“It’s the only thing that’s going to get you out of the situation that you’re in – winning games.”Returning to Madden’s decision to play on for so long, Jim confirmed he had spoken to the referee to get his reasoning.“He said there were a couple of head knocks, so that was the reason why. It’s generally about three but there were a couple of knocks, so I could understand maybe four.

get stuffed over parking issues","story":"Council staff have told a senior boss to “get stuffed” after he “told them off” for parking in the streets when their own car parks are packed out by locals avoiding new charges.Staff working for Angus Council in Arbroath have hit out at the message sent out by Mark Armstrong, strategic resources director, which “reminds” workers to use designated staff car parks – which they claim they can never access.Mr Armstrong had been contacted by councillors in the town – who could not be reached for comment – after they received complaints from locals living nearby.Roads around Dewar House and Academy Lane offices have been particularly hard-hit, as they are largely free of parking restrictions.However, workers have criticised the “spineless” email sent by Mr Armstrong because it fails to address what they claim is the real root of the problem – the off-street parking fees introduced by the council last November.One council worker, who declined to be named to protect her job, said Mr Armstrong could “go and get stuffed” over his remarks.She said: “Mark Armstrong seems to think his time is well spent sending an email to staff telling them that they shouldn’t be parking where they are entitled to park.“He can go and get stuffed – we will park where we wish to park. He needs to get a backbone and back off – we are raging.”In his email, Mr Armstrong claims the council is powerless to stop the public from misusing council staff car parks. He wrote: “I understand members of the public are using council staff car parks in Arbroath, possibly in response to parking charges.“Unfortunately there is nothing we can do to deter or prevent this and I appreciate that this may be forcing staff to park where.“Please remind staff to use our car parks wherever possible.”A spokesman for Angus Council said: “Any suggestion this request aims to put pressure on staff is wrong.“We have no intention of enforcing areas where staff, as members of the public themselves, are entitled to park or vice-versa.“It is simply a request for staff to be considerate of residents and to use staff parking wherever possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie dundee united win can put pressure on top dogs ross county","story":"Theof winter weather last weekend, and the raft of postponements it led to, has given Dundee United the chance to put some pressure on leaders Ross County when the Championship’s top two clash at Tannadice tonight.First to fall foul of the conditions was County’s Highland derby trip to Inverness Caley Thistle on Friday evening, that one going off because of a waterlogged pitch.Had it gone ahead, it would have provided the Staggies with the opportunity to stretch their advantage over United in the race for automatic promotion to a massive  points.Their own scheduled action at Dunfermline on Saturday afternoon had to be called off after heavy snow and rain left the East End Park playing surface saturated.United had already arrived at the ground and most of their travelling support were not that far away when the call-off was confirmed just  minutes from kick-off.That made it a frustrating afternoon, particularly as it was clear the pitch was in no fit state for a game to be played.But it still means the Tangerines can cut the deficit to their main rivals to eight pointsthey can beat them.With another clash between the pair to come in the Highlands early next month, a victory would leave boss Robbie Neilson still believing his side can finish in top spot in the second tier.To do that United will have to find the form that’s deserted them in recent outings. They’ve managed just one win in four games.And as well as a dip in performance over that period, United have struggled to find the back of the net from open play.In the last five games, only Cammy Smith’s close-range opener in the draw at Falkirk was not from a set-piece and the four other efforts to hit the mark have all been from the boot of Nicky Clark, either from the penalty spot or free-kicks.The effort to improve on that will not be helped by the absence of main striker Pavol Safranko tonight and again when Alloa visit on Saturday, because he is now away on international duty with Slovakia.The other experienced No  in the squad, Osman Sow, would not have been fit for the weekend after aggravating a troublesome calf problem early on in the last outing down at Partick Thistle.Sow was being checked in training yesterday but the chances are he will not make tonight and will even be a major doubt for this weekend.That being the case, Robbie has a big call to make when it comes to how he sets up his attack for the next couple of outings.He does at least have Peter Pawlett back available after the one-game suspension he picked up for his red card in the league win over Inverness. Theof the former Aberdeen man could see Clark pushed right up top and him used in a supporting role.Another option would be to use Matty Smith as the main striker but given the young attacker has not started since the Tannadice win over Dunfermline back on January , that would be a big ask.Whatever way he decides to go, tonight and in the coming games, the boss will be looking for both more chances to be created and a much better conversation rate.That will be a challenge against a County team that have hit league-winning form since mid-January.Their only defeat in  games in all competitions was when they went down to Inverness on penalties in a Scottish Cup replay."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"princes-street-evacuation-suspicious-package-found-day-after-glasgow-university-on-lockdown","story":"BREAKING:Glasgow Universityrsquos Dumfries campus evacuated after lsquosuspicious packagersquo found.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less.

A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

He was a former member of shinty#s South of Scotland area executive council and did a lot of work for the Referees’ Association.He was probably best known for his work with young players in Mid Argyll, organising qualying tournaments of the Aviemore Indoor Sixes tournament for many years.

He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"eyesore burns house knocked down","story":"South Ayrshire Councils Burns House, Burns Statue Square.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEyesore Burns House is set to be torn down this upcoming year. Staff working at the South Ayrshire Council building in Ayr will be relocated to other offices to allow work to get underway. The move means historic Burns Statue Square will be completely transformed. The decision was announced as part of the council’s budget for the year, which comes into effect next month. The cost to flatten the office block is estimated to be £. million. Council leader, the SNP’s Douglas Campbell said: “We will relocate staff from Burns House into properties already owned by the council in Ayr and other town centres to continue to support the local day time economy.” Speaking during his budget speech, he added:”This will result in the demolishing of Burns House commencing during this financial year.” Meanwhile across the road the crumbling Station Hotel remains covered over as question marks hang over its future. It is understood ScotRail staff will neverto the dangerous building. It is believed they are to be housed in new portable cabins across the railway line at empty ground on Station Road. The option of a new new transport hub being built in the vicinity of Burns Statue Square has been mooted in the past. But no solid plan has emerged. Councillor Campbell said: “We maintain dialogue with the Scottish Government, Transport Scotland and Network Rail about future investment at the station. Once we are clearer about their intentions we will begin discussions on the future of Burns Statue Square. “ The council’s former regeneration contractor Ayr Renaissance was tasked with hiring consultants to redesign the space at the top of the High Street.

Police objected to McLelland getting a personal licence at the council’s licensing board meeting heard last week, McLelland, , of Main Street, Auchinleck carried out the crime in November . Police Sergeant David Dougan told councillors McLelland was sentenced to a community payback order at Ayr Sherf Court last year as punishment. But McLelland said she was plagued by anti-social behaviour outside at her home in Main Street. She told the board: “I love kids. I regret it.” She claims she has had problems with people “chapping her door” and urinating in her garden. She rushed out to the nearby bus shelter during one incident, she told the meeting.. McLelland said: “I went out. It wasn’t even raw bleach. It is not an excuse. I shouldn’t have done it.” She claimed the bottle was kicked out of her hand and spilled over the victim. But the meeting heard McLelland pled guilty in court. The shop worker said: “I am not in the habit of going out and fighting with kids. “I am a -year-old woman.” She added: “Everybody in this le makes mistakes. Nobody in this world is perfect.” She told the meeting she had phoned the police numerous times to report anti-social behaviour at her property. Councillors adjourned the meeting to discuss whether she should be handed a licence. Ontheir opinion was split with three councillors voting to grant her application and the same number against. Board Chair Councillor Tom Cook had the ruling say and decided to grant McLelland’s licence. He said giving her the licence would not increase her chances of committing a similar offence in the future. Councillors George Mair, John Campbell and Fiona Campbell voted to refuse the licence. Councilors Drew Filson, Lillian Jones supported Councillor Cook’s view to grant it. Councillor Cook said he would grant the licence “albeit with reservations.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEast Ayrshire CouncilCourtsJusticeAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"people say future high rise","story":"NewsPeople to have their say on the future of high-rise flats in AyrTenants asked for their preferred optionShareByGary Fanning:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTenants in the Riverside Place multi-storey flats in Ayr are getting the chance to have their say on the future of the high-rise properties as South Ayrshire Council’s consultation on ‘Your place, your future’ gets underway. The consultation and engagement exercise – approved by Councillors last year – gives tenants the chance to choose their preferred option for the long-term future of the flats: Refurbish  – this means the Council would keep the flats, decant tenants, carry out identied refurbishment works, and thentenants to their refurbished flats. Rehouse  – this means tenants would be rehoused permanently in suitable alternative accommodation and the flats would be demolished. Rebuild  – this means tenants would be decanted to temporary accommodation and the flats would be demolished before some tenantsto a new-build housing development on the Riverside Place site. The detailed consultation, which is based around inidual one-to-one meetings with more than  tenants, has been planned in conjunction with the River Ayr Tenants Association, which represents tenants in the three blocks. The Council has communicated regularly with tenants in the lead-up to the consultation to ensure they have all the information they need to take part. A further letter has now been distributed to homes in Riverside Place following queries and concerns raised by tenants regarding a letter sent to them by Fort, Seafield  Wallacetown Community Council. The community council’s letter appears to query the three consultation options being discussed with tenants and questions South Ayrshire Council’s interpretation of the expert report approved last year regarding the “essential and advisable” works required to the flats. Councillor Philip Saxton, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Housing and Community Wellbeing, said: “We are committed to ensuring that our tenants are fully involved in the discussions about the future of their flats, which is why we’re taking such a detailed approach to this consultation. “It’s vital that tenants understand all the facts so they can form their own views about the option that is best for them. That is why we have gone back out to them to respond to the queries and confusion that have been generated by the community council’s letter. “We fully appreciate that the community council may have a view on the consultation, which is why colleagues are meeting with them next week and we’re happy to keep them informed about the consultation and engagement process. “However, our focus – which was clearly expressed by tenants at the recent River Ayr Tenants Association meeting – has to be on hearing the views of those who will be directly affected by Councillors’ decisions later this year: the tenants of Riverside Place. “We thank them for their participation in the consultation and I can reassure them that their views will be taken into account before any decisions are taken about the future of Riverside Place.” Joe Lafferty, Chair of the River Ayr Tenants Association, said: “We have worked closely with the Council over the last couple of years as discussions around the future of the flats have moved forward – and we very much appreciate the approach the Council has taken. “It is for every tenant to consider what is the best option for them and to ensure their voice is heard by those who will be making the decisions about what happens next. Clear facts, easy to understand information and answers to the questions tenants have is what’s needed and that’s exactly what we have got from the Council.”   Feedback from the consultation will be considered by Councillors in June this year.Full details of the Riverside Place consultation are available at  www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk riverside-place .

The Post can exclusively reveal that the developers McCarthy  Stone have thrown in the towel and withdrawn their multi-million pound proposals. Major question marks hang over the building’s future following the bombshell announcement. The news prompted an angry backlash from Derek Hart, chair of Prestwick North Community Council. In an extraordinary outburst he claimed the building has been “plundered and left to rot.” The building provided a retreat for children battling cancer for more than  years. It was opened by Princess Diana in . In  it was sold by owners Clic Sargent after claims of a “challenging fundraising environment”. They sold it to McCarthy  Stone and trousered £.m from the deal. However, since McCarthy  Stone took ownership and unveiled their luxury flat plans they have been embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. Other objections included the potential impact it would have had on their historic course and the surrounding conservation area. In addition, there were fears that errant balls could smash into residents’ properties. Plans involved building  flats for people aged over , spread out in a T-shape over four floors. Many would have had sea views and balconies. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work on the former retreat had to stop. It was estimated that  jobs would be created between the construction phase and posts at the new development. Despite a PR charm offensive from McCarthy  Stone throughout the process and a public exhibition of plans at the  Club in Prestwick’s Main Street, the developers pulled the plug on the project. A spokesperson said: “Following a strategic review last year we are no longer pursuing any new developments within Scotland and have withdrawn our plans for Prestwick.” Derek Hart reckons the decision is a kick in the teeth for all the campaigners who fought to retain the presence of a sick children’s home in Prestwick. He told the Post: “I find this action taken by McCarthy  Stone not only deplorable but a slap in the face to the Save Malcolm Sargent House team who fought bravely to try to purchase it. “Is it not time for South Ayrshire Council to stop and listen to the community  “The community stated that the development would only feather the nests of McCarthy  Stone – and perhaps chemists –as the age group targeted by them were over  years. “There’s been very little input to Prestwick and we are now left with a building that has been plundered and left to rot. “Will we find the same response to the other end of the beach, at the old Gym, I wonder ”He added: “Time after time SAC have allowed developers to build as they wish with barely a challenge to the character ofthe town and how it should look.”The news will be viewed as a major victory for Prestwick Golf Club, who fought long and hard against the development. A statement by the club said: “While we welcome this news we hope that, should a new development proposal for the site be put forward in the future, the design and scale will be more sympathetic to the surrounding area.” The statement said the club was not against the principle of redeveloping the site but was “disappointed” at the scale and design of the proposed development. It added: “We believed that McCarthy  Stone hadn’t listened to the concerns raised by the club.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrincess DianaSouth Ayrshire CouncilRoyal FamilyPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"shopper yelled get back your","story":"NewsShopper yelled \"Get back to your own country, you Iraqi b******\" to Ayr Lidl workerManus McGhee avoided jail after his foul mouth outburst at the store.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsThe outburst took place at Lidl in Ayr \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man who was asked to leave Ayr’s Lidl store went back in to racially abuse a staff member, writes Edwin Lawrence.

Super-fit Fiona McBlane was , practised yoga and cycled and was in London lapping up a glamorous working le in the music industry for companies such as EMI and Smash Hits. But during a Christmas visit home to Ayrshire she fell unwell with leg, arm and head pain. Such was her distress she admitted herself to hospital. First the minor stroke hit - on January ,  - and then the searing biggie nine days later. It left her semi-paralysed in hospital for  months, unable to speak, hardly walking and retaining very limited brain capacity. That was when Clan McBlane rallied round to give her the best future they could. They had been advised the best place for her was an old folks home but they stood firm. Once Fiona was fit enough to leave hospital she was brought into the bosom of the family in Prestwick. Twelve years on at the age of , Fiona is battling away and has got to the stage where she has joined the gym at Prestwick Tennis Club.

Gillian said: “She loved her work and was a real high flier. “People were drawn to Fiona’s fun-loving nature and her great big heart. “Never for a minute did we think she would have a stroke. “At  years old she had lost everything she loved.” Fiona is prone to falling and choking, often passing out. Sometimes the enormity of what has happened becomes too much for her and she struggles emotionally. But Gillian said: “Our parents taught us to look for the positive things in le and not to feel sorry for ourselves. We spend time together and Fiona enjoys the company. “Despite the extent of her disability, she does brilliantly. “Doctors told us that her friends would eventually tail off but Fiona’s haven’t . They keep in contact with her and visit when they can. “People have shown us great kindness over the years in so many ways and this means a lot, helping us immensely. We don’t know what the future will hold for Fiona but we do know that whatever it is we will face it together.” There are , strokes in Scotland every year. Angela Macleod at the Stroke Association said: “Our latest research shows that by training and taking part in a Resolution Run you are helping to lower your stroke risk. “The funds raised by each runner means we can reach out to more stroke survivors and their families to offer the support that they may need to rebuild their lives.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnstrokeAyrAyr NewsPrestwickRunningCharity"},{"url":null,"title":"upper crust roost alloway","story":"NewsAn Upper Crust roost in AllowayAyrshire Post Property of the WeekShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere are few better places to bring up a family than the secluded suburban streets of Alloway.

The objectors also presented evidence to the committee showing how their own planning policies were being ignored by their officials.Peebles Community Council and many residents objected to the land at South Parks site being earmarked for development in the Local Development Plan back in .Mr Turnbull said: ldquoWhat makes objectors particularly annoyed is the notion that once building sites have been included in Local Development Plans, their inclusion cannot be questioned.\"Their views then were ignored just as their views have been totally ignored now. One of the questions that needs to be asked is, why Mr Turnbull said the conduct of the planning committee with the housing application was ldquoappalling and added that the system is loaded in favour of developers.He added: ldquoWell over  dferent objectors submitted some very detailed evidence to planners who ignored it.\"This has brought many objectors to question the validity of the planning process. It would appear that this process is designed to allow developers to build as and when they want and they can appealtheir application is refused.ldquoObjectors on the other hand have no right of appeal given that they have no right of appeal it is surely essential that they are given a fair hearing where evidence is properly considered.ldquoIn the South Parks case, Councillor Fullarton made comments regarding the Caledonian Road being wide and safe, based on his knowledge of over  years ago - no one challenged him.ldquoWhat has caused so much anger was that not a single councillor on the committee knew enough about Peebles to question Councillor Fullartonrsquos assertion. It may be that the planning committee has insufficient time to deal properly with these more complicated and contentious applicationsthat is the case then something has to change.ldquoThey simply failed to understand the issues before them nor the tremendous amount of anger within our community.\"The Scottish Government has launched an initiative called Democracy Matters, which aims to improve the level of involvement of local communities.Mr Turnbull continued: ldquoWhat is the pointplanning officers can write what they want, ignore government guidance and legislation, which is then allowed to stand by councillors who either do not have the knowledge to challenge them or the will to do so. For democracy to matter the peoplesrsquo voice needs to be heard.The community leader says the democratic deficit will be brought into sharp focus with the next Local Development plan, and heeded a warning to elected councillors to be prepared to answer why Peebles is mooted for major development when Scottish Borders Council is not prepared to develop infrastructure first.Scottish Borders Council strongly refutes the claims that councillors and officials ignored the views of the community.A spokesperson said: ldquoAll planning decisions require the delicate balancing of a range of policy objectives and other material factors, including the views expressed by the Community Council.\"The two recent planning applications in Peebles highlighted how dficult that can be and the complexity of the decision making process. Both proposals were subject to detailed analysis, which was reflected in the presentation of the cases by officers and the y debate members had on these applications.ldquoIt is clear that a considerable amount of time was spent considering the points and issues made both for and against the proposed developments. Indeed, both applications were revised to take into consideration the views expressed by local residents and the Community Council.ldquoUltimately, and after considering all of the evidence before them, the Committee came to the view that it could support one of the applications, which was the development at South Parks.

pound for each offence - and there is still a pound bill outstanding for the  original parking offences between April and July last year.Humphries of Bourtree Place, Hawick, pleaded guilty at Selkirk JP Court to a total of  charges.Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser told the court that there was no CCTV in the car park showing who had come to collect the car on the days of the offences and Humphries had never informed the council of the identity of the driver despite the repeated requests.But he pointed out Humphries worked in the Iceland store which is right beside the High Street car park.Mr Fraser also said that failing to reveal the identity of the driver carried a maximum penalty of pound, for each offence.He explained that the council had to go through the laborious process of establishing who the regular keeper of the vehicle was and to find out who the driver was for the penalty to be paid.Mr Fraser said:\"In relation to all these charges he ignored the correct parking penalty which was not paid.\"There were other people who could have used this car parkspace but have not been able to do so.\"The accuseds vehicle repeatedly committed the offences of being parked overtime.\"Who did that we do not know as the accused did not bother to communicate with the council and say who the driver was which is a legal requirement.\"Not guilty pleas to nine other charges relating to the parking offences were accepted by the Crown.Defence lawyer Colin Severin said his client was negotiating with the council about the outstanding parking fines.He added: \"He got to the point where he was bogged down with the volume of letters coming through and did not know how to react.\"Andrew Bramhall JP told Humphries that ulging the identity of the identity of the driver when an offence is committed was an important part of the Road Traffic Act legislation.He said: \"The onus was on you and it has mounted up considerably.\"Mr Bramhall said he would have fined Humphries pound for each offence but restricted the fine to pound due to the guilty plea.As there were  offences, the fine totalled pound - and Humphries, who earns pound, a year from his salary as the Iceland store manager - was allowed to pay it off in instalments of pound a month.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said afterwards: \"This court case sends out a message that Scottish Borders Council will take action against drivers who fail to pay a parking charge issued in any of our Pay and Display car parks.\"To avoid matters going to court, drivers should pay a parking charge notice within the -day deadline.\"Alternatively, to avoid a penalty altogether, simply pay the appropriate parking fee for your vehicles stay.\"It is also a criminal offence for the keeper of a vehicle to fail to give the identication of the driver to the Councila parking charge notice has been issued.\"If anyone is concerned about an outstanding parking charge notice they have received please contact the Councils parking team on    or visit our website.\""},{"url":null,"title":"lorry-driver-accused-of-being-four-times-legal-limit-on-a7-and-a68","story":"A LORRY driver has been accused of being more than four times the alcohol limit while driving through the Borders.Sixty two year old Donald Russell denies driving with a breath alcohol count of  microgrammes -

With  minutes left, a tremendous fingertip save, by Neil McMillan, pushed the ball over the bar.With four minutes left the away side put the game beyond #Dale#s reach when Matthew Lamont tried to clear a corner shot but unforunately scored an own goal.In high winds and driving rain the game fizzled out.Both sides had played well in the conditions and kept the ball on the deck in addition, referee, Archie Mitchell said it was an easy game to ref with no bad tackles.The match ball was sponsored by Wee Toon Sports and a Carradale spokesperson thanked Food for Thought for the post match hospitality.Tomorrow Carradale travels to Helensburgh for an early kick off at noon."},{"url":null,"title":"kspbs novice b band impresses","story":"Last Sunday#s Livingston performance was the first time a pipe band of any grade from Campbeltown has taken part in these championships and it was dficult for them to know what to expect.The band was in a category of  others and they needed a good performance, to get a place, as there were a number of top bands playing.Kintyre Schools Band, the top band from a non-fee-paying school, gave a great performance playing Sweet Maid of Glendarual, Greenwood side, Fairwell to Aberdeen and Campbell’s Fairwell to Redcastle.After everyone had played it was over to the judges and the Novice B band was placed as follows: piping adjudicatorone: J Wilson # , PA two:  J Connor-, drumming adjudicator: A Dudgeon-, ensemble adjudicator-D Brown-.When added together this gave the Campbeltown band a total of  points and gave them a very credible fourth place and only two points off the second placed band.After the results were confirmed Pipe Major Fiona Mitchell said how proud she was of her young band and thought th place was a very good start to the season.Both KPBA bands, KSPB and Beinn an Tuirc Kintyre are now practicing hard for the first major pipe band competition of the season when the bands perform at the British Championships in Paisley on Saturday May .KSPB Novice B band perform at Livingston.

cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will bring energy ashore from an offshore wind farm ndash on land at the former Cockenzie Power Station by Scottish Ministers.A planning application was initially lodged with East Lothian Council but was called in by the Scottish Government before a decision was made.That decision sparked anger after it was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China, where she met representatives of Chinese state owned Red Rock, which owns Inch Cape.Now the company has presented a revised plan of the space it intends to use to Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council.The community council posted the new design on social media and revealed plans were under way for Inch Cape to host workshops in the local communities in the coming months.The image shows the substation on about a third of the original .-hectare footprint applied for.One of the biggest concerns raised by communities and the local authority, which owns the land, was that a substation dominating the old power station site would make it a no-go area for other developments.The new plans were welcomed by many on the community councilrsquos Facebook page, with one person saying: ldquoGood news, less sterilisation of the site.Ian Johnson, Inch Capersquos project manager, said: ldquoWe are continuing to engage with East Lothian Council and local community councils on options to signicantly reduce the footprint of the onshore transmission works and moving this to the west of the site.ldquoWhile this detailed design plan is subject to further technical assessments, consultation and approval from the council, we are taking steps to ensure remaining land is available for other developments."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-school-pupils-to-take-part-in-strike-against-climate-change","story":"The NBHS Eco Committee have encouraged students to travel by public transport to attend the rally campaigning for stronger government action to combat climate change.The Edinburgh protest is one of many around the world that are happening tomorrow morning, where school children are walking out of classes to protest climate change.The protest starts at am outside the Scottish Parliament.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe want to support our young people as global citizens to have their voice and to be able to express their views on important matters such as climate change.\"The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of paramount importance to us.

That novel was widely lambasted for its so-called profanity, which so shocked one judge, Rabbi Julia Neuberger, she stormed out of the meeting. ldquoOver my dead body was the mildest of her comments.About a year ago, Kelman finished a new novel which, he revealed, has still to find a publisher. After a long period with Secker  Warburg and Hamish Hamilton, he moved to Canongate with his last two books, That Was a Shiver, and Dirt Road, both of which were well received. But this new manuscript languishes, untouched and apparently unloved. Nobody, it seems, even in his own heath, is willing to make a decent offer for it.With some writers, you could understand. Thanks to technology that registers every sale, publisherscan see exactly how bankable their books are. When approached by a writer, they can track their performance at the click of a mouse. If this is healthy, they are far more likely to pounce on them thanthe novelistrsquos sales have not even covered their advance, leaving a publisher effectively in the red.This does not, of course, mean the novelist is no good. Sometimes it indicates the reverse. Literary fiction is a highly raried taste ndash as it always was. Only the most fortunate of such writers make a good living from the proceeds of books alone. For most it is a struggle to get by, hence the number finding shelter teaching on creative writing courses. Kelman himself went down that route for a time, but you can be fairly sure thathis books had sold like airport bestsellers, there would have been no need to find a financial cushion.In what you can only call the good old days, a young writer like Graham Greene would be given considerable leeway with his early books by a publisher confident that one day he would reward their patience. Today, there is no slack in the system, no time to nurture or take the long view. You are only as good as your last book. And in the case of someone like Kelman, whose readership is a mere fraction of those interested in serious fiction, that spells trouble.Why do most of those who leap on every title by Julian Barnes or Rose Tremain often not bother with Kelman  Undoubtedly, the furore over his Booker winner damaged his reputation, not only in the rest of the UK, but also here. Kelman, however, suspects there is a more fundamental and disturbing reason. He believes that English publishers are ldquokeeping a lid on Scottish writers, by dismissing them as a genre. They would rather publish mediocre English novelists, he says, than good Scottish ones.Read more: Kelman: British establishment is keeping a lid on Scottish writingThere are enough excellent Scottish novelists reaching print to argue that point, but for me this is a distraction from the main issue. EvenKelman is right and there is anti-Scottish bias among literary publishers, that still does not explain why no Scottish publisher is willing to take him on.Could his new book be too dficult, or tricky  It would seem strangethat were the case, given his long and distinguished backlist in which there is rarely a misfire. The answer is far more likely to be about money, and the state of the book trade in general. In other words, there is no publisher able or prepared to offer a fee commensurate with what a Kelman book is worth. Thatrsquos worth in artistic terms, you understand, not sales. I do not doubt it would be a better investment to publish Diana Gabaldonfilling the coffers is the main objective.But while the kind of books Kelman writes are unlikely to shower a publisher in gold, they would add immeasurably to its lustre. Here is a novelist who has been shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, and is a worthy Nobel contender. Indeed, consider this my official plea to the Nobel Prize Literature Committee to read everything Kelman has written and tell us his oeuvre does not equal or surpass many of their laureates.Yet, nobody on his doorstep wants to take his new book. Itrsquos hard to think of another country where its foremost living writer would be treated like this. The only conclusion you can come to is that the world of books has lost it.

However, there are signicant caveats.Crucially, the resulting percentage is not a pass rate for the school.

Some schools lower down have more than  per cent of pupils experiencing disadvantage.Armed with this information our league tables tell us something very signicant about the impressive work of many schools serving disadvantaged communities.St Andrews School, in the east end of Glasgow, is a case in point with  per cent of pupils from the most disadvantaged communities, but  per cent going on to secure five or more Highers.The national data from the league tables is also interesting because it shows how dficult it will be for the Scottish Government to achieve its stated aim of closing the poverty-related attainment gap.Read more:In full: How every secondary school in Scotland ranks in exam league tableThis yearrsquos figures show disadvantaged pupils have done better than ever before, with a . per cent improvement in average overall attainment.However, because pupils from the most affluent neighbourhoods have seen attainment rise by nearly two per cent, the attainment gap is actually getting wider on this measure.Mark Priestley, professor of education at Stirling University, said improvement in the performance of the poorest pupils was welcome, but closing the gap was dficult to achieve through education alone.He said: ldquoWhen additional resources are put into schools in disadvantaged neighbourhoods to improve performance it may not be surprising that pupils from other backgrounds also benefit.ldquoBut education is not a magic bullet and the impact of poverty has to be tackled with wider measures."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-sets-sights-on-bigger-role-in-global-issues","story":"For the first time, her government has been registered with the US authorities as a foreign power trying to influence affairs on the other side of the Atlantic.Calling itself the ldquoGovernment of Scotland in North America, it has also engaged a public relations agency in Washington DC to help it become ldquomore vocal and present internationally.Explained:Nicola Sturgeon bids to give Scotland greater influence global issuesScottish business quangos in the US have been registered in the same way for years, but the governmentrsquos plans are overtly political.In paperwork filed with the US Department of Justice, it contrasts its own ldquoprogressive voice with the Trump presidency, Brexit and ldquoa conflicted Congress.The Tories said Ms Sturgeon was taking the Scottish Government into inappropriate territory.Ms Sturgeon last month spent five days in the US and Canada to promote Scottish businesses and Scotland as a place to invest, but also talked frequently to the media about independence.Read documents in full: Government of Scotland in North AmericaThe First Minister was also recognised by the United Nations for her work in advancing gender equality during the trip.Opposition parties have criticised the recent overseas forays as extravagant -

Abuses of power are only possible because such power exists in the first place and because the land market is so open to anyone from anywhere in the world.Quite literally, the market is unregulated and, as the Commission notes, the evidence demonstrates a pattern of market and social power associated with landownership that is consistent with characteristics of monopoly power in other economic sectors. Indeed,land was subject to the powers of the Competitions and Markets Authority, there would be a clear case for intervention.The report notes that market and social power can damage the public interest, that detrimental impacts on communities are a product of a concentration of power and that Scotland would benefit from a far more erse pattern of power over land. Importantly, this is not simply a question of private landownership but also public.Scottish Ministers are themselves by far the largest landowner in Scotland and there is a strong case for decentralising some of this power to local councils, communities and iniduals.Land reform to date has tinkered at the margins for too long. There is nothing in this report that comes as a surprise to land reformers but it is refreshing to read advice from a government agency that tackles this question head on and recommends new powers of intervention as well as reform in the way that land is taxed.If Scottish Ministers approve these recommendations then we could be on the brink of resolving the central problem of Scottish landownership, namely the centuries-long persistence of hegemonic landed power.I am not holding my breath, however. Scottish Ministers have had opportunities to act ndash on inheritance law and on land taxation and have avoided both. If this report is to be the tipping point that it could be, Government needs to be far clearer about its intentions and timescales.Above all we need to move beyond debates about community ownership, important thought that is. The reason many communities find themselves having to contemplate the prospect of landownership is solely because of the failings of the current system that is open to abuse and speculative financial gain by external interests.Admittedly, such reforms take time and the path ahead is strewn with legal and political challenges. Today in Parliament, we will be debating the topic and I will be inviting Parliament to agree with the findings of the Commission. Such agreement would provide a clear expression of the will of the people of Scotland to turn the clock on centuries of landed power and make land an asset for the many and not the few."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-blame-game-what-the-papers-say-on-pms-extension-request","story":"The Prime Minister made a direct appeal to the public on Wednesday evening, telling the UK that she was ldquoon their side.:Brexit: What Theresa May said in her Downing St statementShe has written to European Council president Donald Tusk formally requesting an extension of Brexit until June  ahead of travelling to Brussels for more discussions.My full statement on #Brexit after receiving PM Mayrsquos letter requesting an extension of Art. : https:t.co mVWReAo#euco pic daBLUIQMqmdash Donald TuskMarch , The word ldquoblame features on a number of the fronts, with the i referring to the ldquoBrexit blame game, while thecarries the headline ldquoMay: donrsquot blame me for Brexit crisis, blame MPs.The paper says Mrs May is facing a ldquofurious backlash after her statement in Downing Street, with MPs suggesting she should step down.Comments from the Prime Minister also lead the Times, with the paper suggesting Mrs May is trying to turn votersrsquo anger at MPs.The Times   The newly restored Painted Hall , is at the Old Royal Naval College in London.

It was the home of Jacobite rebels, its illegal whisky trade led to the Scotch whisky industry we know today, and its people fought in the countryrsquos great wars but all this was in danger of being forgotten.\"The Heritage Centre will bring that history to le and unveil the secrets of the Cabrach through interactive exhibits where visitors will travel back in time to experience le in this harsh but beautul place.The project took shape two years ago after researchers commissioned by the Cabrach Trust discovered a former illicit whisky bothy built into the side of a hill and thought to date back to the early s.Sheltered by a small crag and built into the side of the hill, the secret bothy offering smugglers an excellent vantage point to keep an eye out for excise men on the nearby highway.The centre makes use of those existing traditional farm steadings.Peter McIlhenny, partner at LDN Architects, which has put together the design, said: ldquoThis project will transform an existing ancient steading into a visitor attraction, centred around a museum and distillery. Our design adapts the existing range of buildings in a delicate way, whilst incorporating a completely new st century building containing the reception, tasting room, shop, cafeacute and multi-purpose spaces.\"Those new spaces are tuned to visitor needs while taking full advantage of the magnicent panoramic outlook of the setting. Great care has been brought to the selection and placing of materials to both old and new.The distillery received pound, from the William Grant Foundation, pound, from Foundation Scotland, and pound, from the Reekimlane Foundation. A further pound, came from an anonymous donor.The funding from William Grant Foundation will go towards cultural heritage activities, refurbishing the buildings and preparing the site to allow preparatory works.Additional funding for the project has come from a mix of social finance, grants and charitable trusts and foundations, with several other funding applications in progress.The centre plans also included room for a shop, cafe, exhibition space and play area.Cabrach, which means antler place in Scottish Gaelic as a one time home of herds of red deer, is home to some of Scotlandrsquos rarest wildle and a once-secret nuclear bunker, among other attractions.In  it was given dark sky discovery site status.

We are now engaging with the treasury on the issue of revenue support for the sector, and any support she can give to that would be very welcome. In the meantime, we have the prospect of the Energy White Paper coming up. Will she use her office to ensure that the potential for marine renewable energy generation is fully recognised when that white paper comes to publication #Responding on behalf of the government the energy minister, Claire Perry MP, said: “I don’t want to pre-empt the white paper, but one of the things we will show in that is how the ongoing attempts to be technology neutral to try and work across the piece to generate low cost, low carbon and highly competitive technologies will be part of that. We remain interested in marine and tidal as the Rt. Hon. Gentleman knows. Of course we need to discuss with the Treasury any support mechanisms, but I do want to continue to engage with the sector on a long term basis.#Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “White papers outline government’s thinking on policy areas, and are a key stage in influencing decisions made by ministers. Getting something in the white paper on support for the wave and tidal energy would be a huge coup for the industry which is big in the Northern Isles.“The marine energy industry is an innovative area of research, with the potential to add even more to our ability to export renewable energy to mainland Scotland. If the minister is committed to what she said about the policy now being ‘technology neutral’ then marine renewables should get a fair chance to be heard.“With a little more understanding and investment from central government, I believe we will soon reach a point where this industry can support itself, and provide stable, well paid and skilled jobs for many in Orkney and Shetland.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the s, his predecessors in the conservative government then regarded our fishermen as expendable. It is beginning to look like this government has taken the same attitude towards our farmers.”Responding on behalf of the government parliamentary under-secretary of state for exiting the European Union, Chris Heaton-Harris MP, replied: “I disagree entirely. The tarf schedule is designed to protect every sector of the economy including agriculture. He then went on to talk about standards, and we are not dropping standards of what we expect in agricultural goods.”Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “The minister can disagree with me all he wants, but he can’t dismiss the views of our farmers and crofters.

The government must start listening to the experts in this area, and the unions who work on their behalf otherwise we risk undermining an important part of our rural economy.“With only nine days left before we could find ourselves falling into a no deal scenario, the government have got to fix these tarf schedules before they do irreparable damage to our agriculture industry.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He set out that, between -, tourism numbers have increased by an impressive  per cent to almost , people with an estimated value of nearly £m.Mr McArthur warned that this success could not be taken for granted and presented its own challenges. As well as urging ministers to resolve the stand-off over RET and provide support for the replacement Orkney’s ageing internal ferry fleet, the Orkney MSP also repeated his call for Orkney’s world-class heritage sites to be backed by world-class infrastructure.Speaking after the debate, he said: #Tourism is one of the few sectors that touches almost every part of the country and it is one where Orkney has been punching above its weight over recent years.#With the natural assets we have and a lot of hard work by those involved in all aspects of the tourism sector locally, Orkney has seen visitor numbers and income increase signicantly over recent years. This success has brought awards and recognition, but it also brings with it challenges.#Everyone knows that Orkney’s reputation for quality requires the tourist experience to be managed carefully. This will involve taking pressure off key sites as well as making more of what Orkney has to offer.#It also needs Scottish Government to step up to the plate, not least when it comes to transport links. The long-overdue introduction of RET would help Orkney remain competitive as a destination, while replacement of the ageing internal ferry fleet is not only vital for the islands they serve but a means of encouraging visitors to explore more widely once they get here.“Ministers also have a role to play, through Historic Environment Scotland, in helping ensure that Orkney’s world-class heritage sites are supported by high-quality infrastructure. Local partners, including Destination Orkney and the Council, must be closely involved but investment through HES is crucial to making this happen.“There is good reason to believe that Orkney can continue playing to its strengths when it comes to tourism and there will be plenty of opportunities over the years ahead showcase our islands.  However, we cannot be complacent about what it will take to maintain and enhance Orkney’s reputation for good quality”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A public consultation is to follow later this yearThe consultation contains proposals around the use of one of two member wards, where a ward includes an inhabited island — an option made available under new islands legislation — as well as looking at the boundaries of wards.As part of the review, the public#s views will be asked for this summer.Responding to the launch of the consultation, a spokeswoman for Orkney Islands Council explained that, the commission are not recommending changes to the number of councillors but have proposed some changes to ward boundaries. Representatives from the commission are due to come to Orkney next month to discuss the proposals.Speaking yesterday, Ronnie Hinds, chairman of the commission, said: “We are pleased to begin our consultation on electoral arrangements with the three councils today and I look forward to engaging with them on our proposals.#It is important that electoral arrangements for Scottish councils are effective and that our proposals deliver on requirements for electoral parity and, as far as possible, take account of local ties and special geographical considerations.“We also welcome the flexibility offered by the IslandsAct to use one or two member wards and have used this flexibility as appropriate in our proposals. After completion of our consultation with councils we will be seeking public views on our proposals over the summer.”The  Review of Electoral Arrangements will make proposals for the six council areas specied in the IslandsAct  – Argyll and Bute, Highland, North Ayrshire, Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands.The commission is conducting the review in two phases, focusing firstly on Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands, with the reviews of  Argyll and Bute, Highland and North Ayrshire to take place after the public consultation in the islands groups takes place.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But when the guy propping up the bar is Theresa May’s top Europe advisor, Olly Robbins – the architect of her strategy in Brussels and the ERG’s favourite hate figure – you should safely be able to draw your Brexit roadmap from it.When ITV reported a second-hand overheard conversation in a Brussels bar where Robbins described how MPs would end up being presented with the option of May’s Brexit deal or a long delay, it seemed to offer a key that would unlock the whole process of leaving the EU.After MPs voted against no-deal last week and for an extension to Article , events appeared to be following Robbins’ script perfectly. The Government had hoped to bring the deal back for a third vote this week, with the threat of staying in the EU for anywhere between nine and  months looming over Brexiteers, forcing them to fall into line. Personally, I admit to breathing a sigh of relief at the end of last week’s chaos, thinking that a plan was coming together and no-deal was off the table.But some forces are beyond even Robbins’ reckoning. And the fact that his plan was so dramatically derailed this week means that a no-deal Brexit – always the legal default – is now likely to happen by accident, unless there is an even bigger twist in the week ahead.No one in Government predicted John Bercow’s intervention ruling out a third vote on the Brexit deal unless there was a signicant change in content or circumstances. That in itself is worrying – the convention that motions can’t be voted on twice in the parliamentary session isn’t an obscure one. No one needs more evidence that Downing Street is floundering, but there it is.His critics say Bercow’s intervention was an attempt to block Brexit and allow the second EU referendum he really wants, or at least rule out a no-deal scenario. If that’s true, it may have backfired.: No-deal Brexit would place food banks in ‘dangerous position’, warns Ian BlackfordBy ruling out a vote before yesterday’s EU Council summit, the Commons Speaker denied the Government its best chance of getting the deal through. The threat of a long Brexit extension needed to be a vague one, with fatigued EU leaders worried that keeping the UK in the bloc for two more years would trash its laws and budget-setting process.Bercow’s statement forced the EU Commission’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier to come out the following day and say a long extension had to have a “clear purpose” – something largely absent from the UK’s strategy. And it also gave time for Brexiteers in the Cabinet to ambush May and force her to take a request for a long extension off the table.The spectre aimed at scaring Brexiteers was vanquished, leaving opposition MPs as the only avenue for getting the votes to pass the deal. With her extraordinary statement in Downing Street, trying to sht all the blame onto parliament, May burnt that bridge, too.To avoid a no-deal Brexit, the UK is now at the mercy of two groups: Remainers in the Cabinet, and the  governments of the EU.A group of pro-EU Cabinet ministers have insisted they would do whatever it takes to stop no deal. They will have the chance to prove it next week.Some argue that the door is open to a longer extension. Both Barnier and French President Emmanuel Macron have said there is a way back,the UK is willing to dare “deep political change”.This could be a general election or a second EU referendum, but what the EU really wants to hear is that the red lines that have made a deal so dficultare going to be jettisoned, either by May, or her successor.: Jeremy Corbyn won’t rule out stopping Brexit as PM arrives in BrusselsThe Remain group in Cabinet includes Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who joined Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke in breaking a three-line whip to abstain on a motion to extend Article  last week. With so little time left, resignation isn’t enough. They would have to become the ‘men and women in grey suits’, insisting the Prime Minister abandons her red lines, or ushering her out of Downing Street.The likes of David Lidington would need to lead a government of national unity in all but name, getting a Brexit deal through with Labour and SNP votes that keeps the UK in the single market and customs union. It would likely mean the end of the Conservative Party as we know it at the very least, it would leave it to the next Tory leader to put its surviving pieces back together.If that sounds far-fetched, that’s because it is: even in Brexit Britain, a week can’t possibly hold that much drama.EU leaders can’t give the UK something it isn’t prepared to ask for itself. Conservative MPs lost the chance to push May from office when they failed to do the job before Christmas. The UK’s venerable parliamentary democracy has proven itself not to be nimble enough for the last-minute pivot needed to avoid a catastrophic accident, and evenit could, its leaders command too little confidence to bring the public along with them.And in EU capitals, an election or a new EU referendum would really only be a leap into fresh uncertainty, which the continent scarcely needs. Leaders and officials gathered in Brussels spoke openly about the “crisis” in the UK, and don’t want their fragile politics infected by the febrile mood in and around Westminster.It’s far more likely that the Government simply doesn’t have the votes –it even puts the deal back before the Commons – and rather than sparing the UK, the EU decide to cut their losses and let it meet the future it set for itself.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn won t rule out stopping brexit as pm arrives in brussels","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has refused to rule out cancelling Brexit by revoking Article  as both he and Theresa May met EU leaders in Brussels with eight days to go until the UK leaves the EU.Arriving for an EU Council summit to sign off an extension to Article , the Prime Minister was askedshe would lead the UK out of the EU without a deal and said the most important thing was for parliament to deliver on the result of the referendum.Brussels is insisting that any delay to Brexit is condition on parliament approving Mrs Mays deal, and that the extension only runs to the date of European elections on  May, not the Prime Ministers requested date of  June.: No Deal Brexit would place food banks in ‘dangerous position’, warns Ian BlackfordSpeaking after what he described as \"very constructive discussions\" with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and European Commission secretary general Martin Selmayr in Brussels, Mr Corbyn said calls from other opposition leaders for Article  to be revoked to avoid no-deal was \"hypothetical\".\"So far as were concerned, we think theres an urgency in constructing a majority for an agreeable solution and thats what were concentrating on at the moment,\" he said.\"We think that what we are proposing can be achieved in the British parliament.

They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in . The  documents, which are inidually dated, numbered and signed, relate to the rights of deacons and tradesmen in the city, the selling of meat at the Tolbooth and the making of salt in Newhaven.Early conservation work on the documents, which were recently discovered in the Museum of Edinburgh’s own storage facility off the Canongate, has revealed watermarks – one of a goat and another of a flower – which can only been seen when held up to light.It is thought the papers entered the archives of the local authority in the s, but were then “lost” before being rediscovered nearly a century later during conservation work.

It’s fascinating to think of her reading through these official papers before carefully applying her signature.“They are staying in storage at the museum for now. But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters.

The Glen Road man’s first job was as a compositor printer with Pitman’s University Press. However, during these early working days, he undertook voluntary youth work within the greater West Belfast area and soon realised that this was where his future lay. Eventually Pat left Belfast for Leicester University where he achieved his degree in youth and social care, following this up with a Master’s degree from the Ulster University. Pat eventually became a youth worker in charge at St Michael’s Youth Club, Finaghy Road North, where he spent many happy years. During this time, Pat managed a number of the youth football teams, with home games being played at Woodlands playing fields. Pat’s brothers commented that to say he was “vocerous” in his coaching would be an “understatement”. “In fact the story goes that at this time, house prices in Orchardville depreciated by  per cent!”At a time when West Belfast was often in turmoil, the youth club was a haven for young people a place where parents knew their children would be safe. Pat took this onboard and enabled the young people in his care to reach their full potential. Pat developed an insatiable love for sport from a very early age. He joined Davitt’s GAC for a short time before transferring to St Agnes’ where he spent many happy years as both a player and manager. In the course of his time with the ‘Aggies’ Pat, along with many of the players, made those never to be forgotten trips to the continent and of course Shannon events that proved to be hugely enjoyable and deeply spitural ventures. A serious arm break when he was  curtailed Pat’s playing career but he had much success in his managerial roles. Pat, affectionately known as Butsy, also loved soccer and had a long and enjoyable time playing for and supporting Dominic Savio. During the ’s, Pat embraced the basketball scene and in particular St Gall’s basketball club. Pat was committed totally to this new undertaking. In fact, his brother Gerard remembers ing back to Denewood one day and discovering a very large American making himself a cup of tea. Of course Pat had not told Gerard that ‘Soupy’ Campbell would be staying for a few days – a bit of a shock. As a commentator and administrator Pat gave  per cent to this new venture. His famous commentary during lives games in the Andersonstown Leisure Centre is still talked about.On the sporting front, Pat finally finished up as a member of Falls Bowling Club where he spent many happy years as a player, administrator and advisor to the long suffering groundsman. Pat eventually became the club president, something of which he was particular proud of. He also became president of the private greens – a role which again Pat embraced with diligence and total commitment. A spokesperson for Falls Bowling Club described Pat, their th President, as someone with a personality that “could fill the Waterfront Hall”. “His passing has left a gap that we will not attempt to fill.”Married to Shelia since August  , Pat lived le to the full, had a hugely positive influence on many and ultimately made a dference.

However, after ing to education at the Belfast College of Business Studies in the late s, he enrolled in history classes, which he would go on to utilise with the fledgling Belfast History Project.“I came back from college and started to get people involved in learning about the history of the area,” he explained.“From that, we discussed a number of dferent ideas. One idea we had worked on before that was cleaning up Clton Street Cemetery – which was where we used to drink our cider. It was all overgrown and wrecked at the time, but we all got together to fix it up. We tied in with people like Enterprise Ulster, and then Belfast City Council took it over and a number of volunteers came on board. Through that we developed this interest in local history.“Once the ball started rolling that was it. We started doing dferent educational projects. One of the things we started to discuss was putting a magazine together, which sounds very easy, but at that time there was this new thing coming out called a computer that you had to learn to use. Then you had to learn the computer programmes, which in those days was Pagemaker. Then you had to learn about printing and all the rest of it. Once we go up and running everything just fell into place.”The Belfast History Project has been exemplary in its endeavours, setting up groundbreaking publications and establishing history tours in long-unexplored areas of the city.“One of the good things is that when you look in Belfast city centre now and you see all the tours done here and there – blue badge this, white badge that – we get to look at it and say we did it first,” said Joe with a smile.“We did a walking tour in the Half Bap area and one of the very first tours was cancelled because of a bomb scare – not many tour operators can claim that.”The end of the conflict has ushered in a new age of competition as ious operators compete to sell tours of the ever-developing city of Belfast. While Joe believes the growing interest in local history is “brilliant” he insists branding and profits have often got in the way of fact.“People are trying to put these brands on things,” he said.“At my last count Belfast has nine-quarters. When I was at school,I was asked how many quarters there were andI had said nine I know what would’ve happened.“There is a lot of  stuff like this Tribeca development, which is a lot of nonsense.“They should do the names to reflect the history of the area. It annoys me when people try to put a  history on an area or say things that just aren’t true. We’ve always argued thatyou’re going to do history you should tell the truth. I love to see the tourism industry grow and change, but as long as they stick to a principle of truth.”Having started as a small local initiative, the Belfast History Project has flourished over the years, and now provides tours all over Europe, with their Russian tours booked up for nearly two years in advance. However, with all of its wider triumphs, the Belfast History Project remains a social enterprise, whose key aim is to give back to the community. Local tours and events still run regularly, such as the highly successful historical photographic exhibiton, which recently appeared in the New Lodge – and, as Joe explained, “It’s all about education”.“If we get people into history we can get them into education and guide them along their own path,” he said.“For example, we had a group of kids studying the history of the New Lodge, which grew to Belfast, Ireland and then Europe. They might be kids at the time, and they’ll mess about, but about tenyears later they’ll come back to us and say ‘That was the best project I was ever part of’ and that gives us a buzz.”Joe continued: “I remember years ago that the Barrack area in the New Lodge was just called the Barrack, but younger people didn’t know why it was called that. If you ask them now they’ll tell you it’s because there used to be an army barracks there.“Whenever you do a photographic exhibition and people are learning about their own area, then that’s the start of an educational journey.“As we always say, there is no more fruitful form of education than to raise the interest of people in their own surroundings.“Once you do that it can open up countless other opportunities.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"priceless 1916 artefacts to go on show at opening of new james","story":"AN ORIGINAL  Proclamation along with the printing blocks used to create the document are among the historically invaluable artacts to go on display for the first time ever together when Áras Uí Chonghaile opens its doors next month. The Gaeltacht Quarter-based £. million three-storey building is set to welcome tourists and visitors from Saturday, April  when the centre opens to offer an interactive exhibition, study area, a fascinating library of Connolly’s writings, café and conference facility. The opening of Áras Uí Chonghaile comes three years after a statue of James Connolly was unveiled outside the Falls Community Council to commemorate the th year of the Easter Rising. The bronze statue was unveiled by a great-grandson of the  hero, James Connolly Heron, who described West Belfast as Connolly’s “spiritual home”.The ambitious project, led by Fáilte Feirste Thiar, will host a pageant parade on April , Good Friday, and will leave from Conway Mill, a site where James Connolly organised mill workers during the time he made West Belfast his home. “Aras Uí Chonghaile is designed to celebrate everything James Connolly contributed to Belfast, Ireland and beyond,” explained Fáilte Feirste Director Harry Connolly. “There are five core elements to the centre, starting with the ground floor, world-class visitor exhibition. The first floor of the centre will house the Connolly Library and will consist of the world’s finest collection of writings including books we have secured from when James Connolly spent his time in Kilmainham Gaol. The fourth element of the centre will be an event and conference space, with all the first class facilities you would expect.”Harry told the Andersonstown News that a year-long events programme has also been planned with folk sessions, film club meetings held once a month in conjunction with Sean Murray’s Respect film company, and a series of seminars and lectures.“We are also delighted to announce that Hatch Café will take up residence in the centre as our hospitality partners and will be open to the public,” he said. Áras Uí Chonghaile centre manger Séanna Walsh spoke of how the centre will host a programme of events that will try to emphasise that “It’s not just about Connolly the Irish rebel, it’s as much about Connolly the trade unionist, the guy who organised the mill workers in Conway Street, the guy who went to the States and organised several trade unions there, who all take their lineage right back that far.” Séanna continued: “There will be a major educational element to the centre, we want schools, colleges, universities coming to see the project.“It’s ground-breaking the things we will have on display for the first time: an original Proclamation and also a half Proclamation which was actually produced by the British to use in evidence during the court martial.“Having the seven signatories at the bottom was all they needed, those along with the original printing blocks will be displayed for the first time ever together. “At the end of the day, the centre has to be Connolly in the round. Not the one-dimensional Connolly – the Irish rebel. It’s important to the legacy of the man this centre is seen as a resource by the trade unions right across the island.”Harry said that there is no doubt Áras Uí Chonghaile will become a key part of the city’s tourism trail. “We want to thank our funders Belfast City Council and the wide range of sponsoring trade unions from the States that have pledged and delivered key financial resources which haveallowed the centre to become a reality.” "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37939559.ece/d42ed/AUTOCROP/w620h342/POLITICS%20382.jpg","title":"eu leaders offer uk brexit delay until may 22 after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is no more that we can have.”I hope we can all agree that we are now at the moment of decision and I will make every effort to make sure we can leave with a deal and move our country forward.Theresa MayFacebookTwitterSpeaking at a Brussels press conference after the announcement Mrs May said: \"Firstly I welcome the Councils approval of the legally-binding assurances in relation to the Northern Ireland backstop, which I negotiated with President Juncker last week.\"This should give extra assurance to Parliament that in the unlikely event that the backstop is ever used it will only be temporary and that the UK and EU will begin work immediately to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by the end of December .\"Mrs May saidParliament does not pass her deal next week the European Council will extend Article  to April  when the UK would have the choice of no deal or to put forward an alternative plan.She saidthis involved another extension then the country will have to take part in the European Parliament elections.Mrs May added: \"I believe strongly it would be wrong to ask people in the UK to participate in these elections three years after voting to leave the EU.\"Mrs May said she would be doing her utmost to ensure her deal was passed next week.\"What the decision today underlines is the importance of the House of Commons passing a Brexit deal next week so that we can bring an end to the uncertainty and leave in a smooth and orderly manner,\" she said.\"Tomorrow morning I will be ing to the UK and working hard to build support for getting the deal through.\"The so-called “flextension” plan was drawn up in a meeting stretching over eight hours at an EU summit in Brussels, as EU leaders wrangled over possible final cut-off dates for Brexit.The format increases pressure on Leave-backing MPs to row in behind Mrs May’s deal, for fear thatit falls the UK could find itself electing new MEPs and remaining for month or years within the EU.But it also creates a breathing space of a fortnightMrs May reaches the end of next week without securing agreement for her package – orSpeaker John Bercow prevents her from tabling a motion which he regards as a repeat of those already defeated by  votes in January and  votes last week.Parliament could use that time to try to take control of the process and force Mrs May towards a softer Brexit stance or second referendum.The bulk of the meeting took place behind closed doors in Mrs May’s absence, after her plea for a longer extension to June  fell on deaf ears.Mrs May had to leave the room after making her case in a -minute presentation to her European counterparts.The Prime Minister was reportedly pressed on what she will doMPs reject her deal for a third time but did not commit herself to a Plan B or rule out a no-deal Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"alevel northern ireland school league table","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No one in public le, whether in journalism, the creative arts or politics, has ever been spared it..pushSo those who say that the current Led By Donkeys billboard campaign is unkind or unwarranted, as Lembit Opik argued on the Nolan Show, are taking a novel and, to my mind, bizarre position.The campaign selects the statements of politicians and recreates them in the format of tweets on huge posters in town centres. The targets include Karen Bradley, our unfortunate Secretary of State, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Theresa May and more to come.I hope.For nothing lts the spirits more in dull political times than for the earnest failures to be held up to public ridicule.In this campaign, the criticism is unusual for a magnicent piece of public satire.Usually satire exaggerates the foibles and absurdities of the targets. Led By Donkeys simply restates them in the words of the politicians themselves.David Cameron really did say that the choice available to us was strong and stable government or the sort of chaos Ed Milliband would bring.And thats funny because Cameron excelled himself in the degree of chaos that could be triggered by a single decision.Political le in Westminster, within the parties, between the parties and between the Government and its partner governments in the European Union, is a shambles. No one knows how the conundrum is to be resolved and how the choice that Cameron offered us is to be realised. We voted on whether to stay in the European Union or to leave it on the assumption that leaving was a realistic prospect.Yet political le is at a halt and the media are distracted by the hand-wringing and head-scratching over how the leave decision that was voted for could actually be delivered.Youd think a leader who offered stability over chaos would have thought that through.Yet he could hardly have done more damage to Parliament, democracy and international relations short of declaring war on France or the Irish Republic.Usually politicians do not make it so easy to ridicule them.Nigel Farage is a twitter joke this week as drones follow his Leave March trying to find him at the head of it, or even at the back of it. And tweeters relish the fantastic buffoonery of the man, the self-inflicted humiliation of summoning the people to his cause and not being there to lead them.Karen Bradley gets quoted saying that she hadnt realised that unionists dont vote for nationalists. Hilarious. But she did say it.In the usual tradition of satire, cartoonists and the sketch writers amply the characteristics or the positions of those they invite us to laugh at.So Spitting Image depicted former Labour deputy leader Roy Hattersley spitting at his audiences. This was deeply unkind. The mans lisp was hardly a personal failing. Hattersley himself was one of the most intelligent and humane politicians we have had, perhaps the last in a generation that produced people who had a compassionate imagination informed by a real education, before the wide boys and the chancers came in.Ken Clarke strikes me as one of that type, somebody you could have a conversation with.David Steele, a co-founder of the Liberal Democratic Party, was always depicted as sitting in the top pocket of David Owen, a slight not only on his apparent secondary position but also on his size. Tony Blair has been depicted by Steve Bell, thecartoonist, with a dead staring eye. John Major was always represented as wearing Y-front underpants over his trousers.Compared to this kind of humour, merely reminding us of the daft and incongruous things that people said amounts almost to respect.My fear is that we dont have enough of this scoffing at our politicians.The viewers and listeners are left to provide it themselves. When Karen Bradley said that killings by soldiers were not crimes, the BBC responded by inviting that old criminal, Sinn Feins Gerry Kelly, onto Evening Extra.If you cant find something to scoff at in a gunman being given a  to sneer at the justication of murder, the very art in which he himself excels, then you are a dull person indeed.Seamus McKee asked Kellykillings by the IRA had been crimes and Kelly conceded after much evasion that they had been against the law of the land at the time.The hoots of derision in thousands of homes and cars passed unheard by the audience.There are arguments which are so bad and so immorally grounded that they arent worth being engaged with rationally. The only thing an insult to your intelligence warrants is an insult in .But there is a genuine feeling abroad that the media dont have the stomach for really tearing down the humbug and hokum of a Gerry Kelly.The danger is always that the argument will get tangled up in whataboutery and other distractions.So the job of ripping into republican smugness falls to the blogger and the commentator. Shane Paul ODoherty, a former bomber himself, provides the most trenchant criticism of the IRA in any forum today. He is scathing and uncompromising and goes so far as to outrage readers by posting photographs of dead bodies, of people shot and dumped as informers on the border.

plannersrsquo recommendation to refuse permission to develop Northern Irelandrsquos first woodland graveyard outside Downpatrick.The decision to allow those behind the controversial proposal for a -acre site at Loughmoney more time to provide additional information was taken at last weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilsrsquo Planning Committee.Plans for the graveyard, which has split public opinion, were unveiled in September  by Down to Earth Ltd, which hosted a series of public consultation meetings to outline the detail of its proposal.Those behind the lsquogreen graveyardrsquo project, which would be sited off the Ballyculter Road and contain parking provision for  cars, say they are confident that the proposal would have a low environmental impact and offer an alternative to those seeking an environmentally-friendly approach to burial.They argue there are no designations that would preclude a development of this nature and that the proposal will enhance the location by creating and enhancing shared space, supporting good design and improving the built and natural environment.Supporters of the project also contend that the project will ldquopreserve restore and enhance ecosystems, turning an arable field into a nature reserve.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed they had representations in support and opposition to the proposal, with the planned burial site having no headstones, with all burials recorded on a map.Signicantly, planners confirmed that while there can be no objections in principle to the proposal, those behind the project had not provided the requested additional information.They revealed that while extra time was allowed to comply with the request, no further extension was being afforded with the recommendation to refuse the application now being made.Planners added: ldquoWhile it is considered that the proposal will not create any unacceptable visual or residential impact due to its nature, it is considered further information is required for the consultees which also encompasses a number of concerns raised from interested parties.Planners confirmed Environment and Rivers Agencies are among those who still require further information to enable them to fully assess the planning application and provide detailed comment.Planners had described the information they required as ldquocrucial and pertinent to the application and that it was most unfortunate that it has not been provided.They said while there may be no objection in principle to the proposal ldquoit is not possible to fully consider the merits of the case at this time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down in pole position  ","story":"DOWN had to dig deep mdash and then some mdash to come away from Netwatch Cullen Park on Saturday with two more precious points.A win or draw for Paddy Tallyrsquos this Sunday against Louth at Pairc Esler would be enough to send Down into a Division  final at Croke Park at the end of the month and secure promotion back into Division .However, Down left it extremely late before securing the spoils and it took a point in added time from Donal OrsquoHare to kill off a game Carlow offering in a controversial conclusion to the game.Three minutes injury-time had been played when Diarmuid Walshe converted a free to tie the game for the home side.With the home fans waiting on the final whistle, play was allowed to continue and OrsquoHare was again Downrsquos saviour with a last-gasp winner.The game was far from being a classic with referee, James Bermingham, booking five Carlow players and seven from Down before issuing red to Shane Redmond from the home county and Kevin McKiernan and Paul Devlin from Down.Carlow led - to - at the interval with Darragh Foley using the wind well in the half landing six points from placed balls.Down used the elements to their advantage after the break and points from Paul Devlin, Conor Poland, Darren OrsquoHagan and OrsquoHare had the visitors in the ascendancy.Carlow then hit back with Eoghan Ruth pouncing on a loose ball in the square before beating an exposed Rory Burns up breaking ball in the big square and eased the ball home to level at - to -.Caolan Mooney restored Downrsquos lead with a point, but Carlow refused to go away. Devlin picked up his red card after a second yellow and Diarmuid Walsh levelled with a free three minutes into added time.That seemed to be it, but the referee let play continue and OrsquoHare showed great composure to send the winning point over the bar from quite a way out.Carlow: Robert Sansom, Chris Crowley, Shane Redmond, Conor Lawlor, Benny Kavanagh, Eoghan Ruth , Ciaran Moran, Brendan Murphy , Sean Murphy, Jordan Morrissey , Sean Gannon, Darragh OrsquoBrien, Conor Crowley, Darragh Foley , Daniel St Ledger.

He is also receiving a gelatin diet, full of calcium, vitamins and minerals, which is important for the development of his shell.ldquoAs JC has taken well to rehabilitation we have decided that it is best for him to be moved to a larger space as he will have more room to swim and e.ldquoLuckily he has responded well to treatment and is currently settling in to his new home where visitors to the aquarium will be able to get a glimpse of the vulnerable species as he continues to recover.The future is looking bright for JC as the team at Exploris will continue to monitor his weight over the coming months. They plan to release him back to his natural environment when he has fully recovered.Loggerhead turtles like JC can live to about  years of age in the wild and usually reach about three feet in shell .Mr Williams says the ultimate goal is to release the reptile back into the wild in warmer waters.This is not the first time Exploris has tried to nurse a lost loggerhead turtle back to health.In January , another loggerhead was found washed up on a Co Donegal beach and was also taken to Exploris suffering from hypothermia.Staff named that male turtle Columba, but sadly it died a short time later, making JCrsquos recovery all the more remarkable..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McKinstry is on the mark at Jimmy’s 10  ","story":"THE Beast from the East was well and truly caged this year as the day dawned bright and sunny, although with a noticeable frosty nip to awaken unsuspecting toes and fingers of the small army of East Down clubmen and their cons which descended on the sleeping streets of the county town on Jimmyrsquos Ten Sunday.Their mission was to display the necessary Kilometre markers and warning signs around the soon to be crowded route.Time was of the essence as upwards of , runners and walkers had signed up for the biggest participation sporting event in the district and with the start brought forward to am, to facilitate the festival paradersquos new start time of pm, it was going to be a tight run affair to have all in place before the runners took over.But, as ever, the super team managed it with a bit to spare.It should be pointed out that at am the pathway at the Quoile was water free.

There will also be a dedicated parking area for coaches.Original plans for the new hotel described finishing the exterior of the building in stone slate, with the accommodation centred around a landscaped courtyard.

You will agree that you were heard with respect and courtesy. As an inclusive and civic unionist, it is what I endorse and seek to promote. If we are to address our many problems it is the least that we can ask of each other.In the course of your talk you referred to the need for unionism, which is not exclusively but largely representative of iniduals from Anglo and Ulster  Scotch Irish backgrounds, to engage with nationalists and republicans to build a ‘new Ireland ‘where unionists could feel included and confident that their rights and rich mosaic of identity, culture and heritage will be afforded respect and recognition.Your recent political actions in New York where you chose to walk with an offensive banner calling for ‘England to get out of Ireland’ lends to the view that your presence and association with the sentiment expressed was either misjudged and misguided or your presentation at QUB is best seen as expedient rhetoric designed to mask strategic and political intentions that are worrying in their implications. You will understand the clear contradictions as viewed from the side-lines and the injury that results.Letter to the editorWithin the audience at Queen’s University were gathered iniduals, like me, who are genetically and culturally from Ulster Scots-Irish or Anglo- Irish background. In regard to the latter they are the embodiment of a culture and heritage which you seem to see as unwelcome. You would do well to remember that there is historically, a thin line between ‘England out’ and ‘English out.’ The history of de-Anglicisation in Ireland is peppered with the legacy of the deliberate targeting of the Anglo-Irish community and identity well beyond the ‘Big House’ and the Ascendancy. More recent history evidences similar traits especially in Northern Ireland where Englishness was subsumed under an umbrella of ‘Britishness.’ To embrace a mantra of exclusivity which implies that this is worthy of support undermines trust and renders problematic any attempt at the reconciliation which civic unionism promotes. It is hard to shake hands with a closed fist. As informed by extensive discussion with other civic unionists, I believe that they are committed to and will continue to work towards building an inclusive community for everyone regardless of identity, culture, gender, faith and heritage. I can envisage no situation wherein civic unionists would denigrate an inidual’s identity or call for anyone to leave their home and get out of Ireland, North or South.I am disappointed to find that Sinn Fein under your leadership is not at the same point.Yours sincerely,Terry Wright, LondonderryJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics      David McNarry: Bring on a general election and the Brexit party coalition to take on the remainersStand fast, stay calm Brexiteers and be patient for a little while longer.

A general election bring it on! The Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems, the lot will be shaking in their remainer boots when a Brexit party coalition takes them on. It will delay the leaving process but a new Parliament representative of the people will make the result worthwhile. The nation is leaving on WTO terms or with a withdrawal treaty which excludes the backstop irrespective of an election, or the Speaker’s intervention. Brexit is unstoppable. We are not as Corbyn asserts in a national crisis but dogged by a self inflicted remainer party political mess.The UK is in a better economical state than any EU member state. Inward investment is the best in Europe and the second best in the world. Employment is at record levels, things are looking up despite the doom and gloom merchants. The country is not grinding to a halt. No one will starve or die of thirst. We produce enough food products to feed ourselves with more than enough left to market. Le saving medicines will never be denied by humanitarians. Business will lead as it always has and succeed in finding its own levels.Time to sort out the men and women from the children and get out of the EU with control of our self determination in responsible hands.David McNarry, Comber, Co DownJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/9601786.jpg","title":"news","story":"Two left with minor injuries after four car collision near Dinas PowysAccidentSchool of the Month - A small school with a big impactAccident\"\"\"Students seize control over primary schoolAccident\"\"\"From the Archive: Man makes bid for world recordAccident\"\"\"View from Westminster: Stephen Doughty MPAccident\"\"\"New wellbeing centre - have your sayAccident\"\"\"Penarth, the sea, le and me: Alison PowellAccident\"\"\"Cycle comments scheme amid roundabout rowAccident\"\"\"Parking charges could be on the way to Vale areasAccident\"\"\"Vale mum to star in TV cancer awareness campaignAccident\"\"\"Vale councils help for homeless rewardedAccident\"\"\"Hotel chain plans next site in PenarthAccident\"\"\"Surgeon shares stories of le working in war zonesAccident\"\"\"Divisions cited as Vale council administration suffers budget disputeAccident\"\"\"Plans for new bypass ‘closest in  years’Accident\"\"\"Vale of Glamorgan Council#s new budget agreedAccident\"\"\"Ty Hafn children#s hospice to support community nursesAccident\"\"\"Main road blocked by tree brought down due to strong windsAccident\"\"\"New Divisional Commander appointed for ValeAccident\"\"\"View from the SeneddAccident\"\"\"Library moves to new site during renovationsAccident\"\"\"Man found dead on beach ruled to have drownedAccident\"\"\"View from Westminster: Stephen Doughty MPAccident\"\"\"Nextbikes scheme could be extended to the ValeAccident\"\"\"Twenty is plenty Vale chiefs tell Welsh GovernmentAccident\"\"\"An Inspector calls: Andy RiceAccident\"\"\"Laughter and partying galore as town enjoys Winter CarnivalAccident\"\"\"New trees to be planted at country parkAccident\"\"\"Explorers ready to take on Iceland expedition for charityAccident\"\"\"Special statement made on Vale council budgetAccident\"\"\"Vale of Glamorgan has lowest rate of diabetes across WalesAccident\"\"\"Cancelled bus routes alarm residentsAccident\"\"\"Fundraiser for care home totals up to £,Accident\"\"\"Volunteers start microplastics survey on beachAccident\"\"\"View from The Senedd: Andrew RT Davies AMAccident\"\"\"View from Westminster: Stephen Doughty MPAccident\"\"\"Delight as company scoops major Welsh awardAccident\"\"\"Penarth, the sea, le and me: Alison PowellAccident\"\"\"Cardf  Vale health board launches eating disorder videosAccident of King Street Penarth.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

QUB has since suspended links with UTC.The letter which informed him of his dismissal highlighted his comments to BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback in June  after PCI’s decision to cut official links with the Church of Scotland over the issue of same sex relationships.He was commenting after a controversial vote by church leaders from across Ireland in June, which affirmed that nobody in a same sex relationship could be a full member of the church.The letter to Mr Kirkpatrick, seen and reported by the BBC, said: “Your contribution to the Talkback programme on  June  brought Union Theological College and by association, your employer, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland into disrepute.“Your comments on the Talkback programme had a signicant and material adverse impact on PCI’s relationship with Queen’s University Belfast and caused hurt and damage to the faculty’s relationship and cohesion.”The letter said he had taken part in the Talkback programme “at a time when there was considerable media comment, mostly of an adverse nature, about your employer, the Presbyterian Church”.It said that he had failed to gain the church’s approval for taking part and that his comments were “unacceptable”.“You stated that you would be ‘horried’, using that word twice,a student at Union Theological College was taught that a same-sex, sexually active relationship was sinful, knowing full well that was the doctrinal position of your employer,” the BBC reported.It also said that when another guest had questioned QUB’s link to UTC, hemade no attempt to defend the college’s reputation.The letter said that Prof Kirkpatrick’s comments had “contributed signicantly to a fracturing of the relationship between your employer and Queen’s University Belfast”.The disciplinary  found that his participation and what he said on-air amounted to gross misconduct and left them with no alternative but to dismiss him.DUP calls for a halt to school consultation Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Another four charges related to offences including entering UTC and attending a Queen’s graduation ceremony after he had been suspended, as well as unauthorised access to the church’s IT systems.These constituted misconduct and would have led to one ‘first’ and three ‘final’ written warnings, the  found.UTC said it could not comment as the case was “an employment matter which is still subject to appeal”.A QUB spokeswoman said it has no role in the staffing arrangements at UTC and is not in a position to comment on specic cases. Prof Kirkpatrick offered no comment to the BBC.Last June Prof Kirkpatrick told BBC Talkback that lecturers at UTC have got to “try and create a neutral environment, and of course I would be heartbrokenanyone turned around and said ‘Kirkpatrick, you have been bigoted against Catholic students or gay students or whatever’.”He said of his students: “I don’t even ask religious background. I don’t ask anything, obviously, about someone’s sexual leanings or anything or like that.”Asked by presenter William Crawley what would happena gay student at UTC was offered “only one view” that a “same-sex sexually active relationship is sinful”, Professor Kirkpatrick replied: “I would be horriedthey would be getting that in our college. And it is of course not consistent with the university as near as possible we uphold everything that the university stands for, our ersity, inclusiveness, equality - all of those things. That is what adds to the mix. I would be horriedthat was the case.”Mr Crawley said today on BBC Talkback that he had a document from the Presbyterian church which lays out the ways they are developing a task group the decision making and dissent. He said it is tasked with drawing up a report on Presbyterian decision making and the place of dissent, and that the report will go first to the general council and then the general assembly of the church.A range of commentators on BBC Talkback expressed deep disappointment yesterday with the Presbyterian Church’s decision to dismiss Professor Laurence Kirkpatrick.Alliance MLA David Ford, who had previously clashed with the church after voicing a more liberal position on same sex relationships, told Talkback he is now “an elder without charge” as a result of that controversy.He said: “If find it very surprising that anything he said... was anything beyond the expression of his inidual conscience as he, a minister of the church, is entitled to do as any minister or elder is entitled to do. They are bound by the decisions of the General Assembly but they have freedom of conscience to express their views. And I find it very sad that Laurence Kirkpatrick has faced disciplinary action to the point of losing his job.”Presbyterian minister Rev Cheryl Meban said there is now “a terrible chill factor” but that it is “really important that we allow there not to be a chill factor that stops us engaging fully in public debate” adding that the Presbyterian Church should be “the first place to be able to express erse opinions and to hold dference well”. She added: “I am deeply disappointed that this has happened. I am really surprised that the outcome has been given as based primarily on what Laurence Kirkpatrick said on the radio. I am horried that would be the main reason why somebody would lose their job.”Gavin Boyd of the Rainbow Project said: “I think it is just a really sad chapter in the story of the presbyterian church in Ireland which I think has got a noble and honourable tradition of dissent and radical thought and inidual conscience.” He added that “over the past couple of years there has been a really depressing chilling hardening of views within the church”.try catch  TrendingSex case man still to tell employerPrayers for local family of Greenvale victim \"Call for drivers to take care as wall

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/west.jpg","title":"major ni firms in eleventh hour westminster plea to avoid no deal brexit","story":"Posted on Friday March  by John Mulgrew More than  of Northern Ireland’s biggest businesses – employing tens of thousands of workers here – have written to MPs in an eleventh hour plea to avoid a ‘no deal’ Brexit.  As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.

For some there will be little or no change to their daily lives after the UK leaves the EU. But for others, Brexit may have an impact on some aspects of their day-to-day lives. To provide as much practical information for people across Northern Ireland that is currently available, a Brexit section has been created on the nidirect website. Useful public information is being published on www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit on a regular basis. You may have also seen some of the digital advertisements across Northern Ireland or on your social media channels asking you to visit the nidirect website for the most up to date information. The nidirect Brexit section also points to information being published by the UK Government to give people as much information as possible. At this stage, it won’t answer every question that people will have. But it serves as a useful tool to get people to start thinking about what they may need to do dferently once the UK leaves the EU. Included in the www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit is a section on travelling, which includes the most up to date information for motorists. Depending on how the UK leaves the EU, motorists in Northern Ireland may need a Green Card to drive across the border. A Green Card is an international certicate of insurance issued by insurance providers in the UK, guaranteeing that the driver has the necessary third-party motor insurance cover for driving in the country being travelled to. In the event of a no deal Brexit, motorists in Northern Ireland travelling to the Republic of Ireland will need a Green Card as proof of insurance. There’s also the most up-to-date information from the Department of Health on prescriptions, medicines and medical supplies. The Department of Health has already said that there is enough medicines and medical products to meet current needs. Therefore people should not ask for longer prescriptions and should continue to follow their GP’s advice. Likewise, arrangements for the provision of specic cross border healthcare services made between the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health in Dublinshould not be affected by EU Exit as they are not based on EU legislation.
