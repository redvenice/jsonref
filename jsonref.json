A debut album is due in springMost modern poets laureate have released recordings of their work, but none hitherto has put out an album billed as providing “ambient post-rock passages, jazz flourishes and atonal experimentalism”. But that’s the latest direction for the current incumbent, Simon Armitage.Armitage and his band LYR, which includes musician Richard Walters and producer and multi-instrumentalist Patrick Pearson, have signed to “post-classical” label Mercury KX, with their first single, Never Good With Horses, out on Friday, and their debut album Call in the Crash Team to follow in the spring.“We’re lining up some shows as well,” said Armitage. “Or as they call them in this business, gigs.” LYR will be appearing on 9 March in Leeds, and 10 March in London.Armitage said the songs on the first album started as “sort-of poems, hybrid things between songs and lyrics and poems”.“I quite often read them at events, but I think they were reaching out for tunes and musical setting,” he said. “This allows me to indulge an aspect of lyricism which is generally not available on the printed page.”Never Good With Horses, in which the poet’s downbeat recitation is joined by awkward keyboards, impassioned vocals and soaring strings, evokes the sadness at the end of a relationship. “That phrase ‘Never Good With Horses’ just drifted into my head one day and the whole thing just fell out of the title, like a venetian blind,” said Armitage. “The speaker is a woman describing her disenchantment with a partner who exhibits traditional male characteristics of insensitivity and a lack of empathy.”The poet described LYR’s music as “electronica, ambient, spoken word by definition – something quite genuinely hybrid”, with all 10 tracks adopting the perspective of a different fictional character. “They’re monologues or soliloquies from people in personal crises,” he said. “They’ve all been written since 2008, which probably has some bearing on that.”Armitage said he was not the only poet laureate to have released music, citing John Betjeman’s 1974 album Banana Blush – although Betjeman subsequently dismissed it as a “vulgar pop song record, a serious lapse in taste”. He also proposed a new party game, where players suggest the kind of band former laureates might have performed with: “Tennyson in some sort of grunge band, maybe.”But even though his voice features on Call in the Crash Team, the poet insisted he has no intention of breaking into song. “My singing days are over,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d63e28a4f36518364cf4fe078c8f77a93aa1e53/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fad5a84fe5ab18028281547cf5269a0b","title":"burberry impact coronavirus hong kong china","story":"British brand closes 24 of its 64 stores in mainland China as shopper numbers plummetBurberry has said the coronavirus is having a devastating effect on the luxury goods market, as wealthy Chinese consumers stay away from shops and travel restrictions curb overseas shopping sprees.It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.\u0026nbspThe virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Two members of one family have been confirmed to have the virus in the UK, and a third person was diagnosed with it in Brighton, after more than 400 were tested and found negative. The Foreign Office has urged UK citizens to leave\u0026nbspChina\u0026nbspif they can.The number of people to have contracted the virus could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsp(WHO) experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP’s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO’s list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a “window of opportunity” to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.The chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, said: “The outbreak of coronavirus in mainland China is having a material negative effect on luxury demand.“While we cannot currently predict how long this situation will last, we remain confident in our strategy. In the meantime, we are taking mitigating actions and every precaution to help ensure the safety and wellbeing of our employees.”Burberry said the outbreak had hit trading harder than last year’s anti-government protests in Hong Kong, where sales halved and stores were forced to close.Burberry said only domestic spending patterns had been affected in China but the widening travel restrictions meant there was likely to be a reduction in spending across Europe and key tourist destinations in the coming weeks.It was too early to predict the impact on its profits in the current financial year, which ends in March, but the company said it would update investors in April.An analyst at the Share Centre said investors should expect a significant impact on Burberry’s profits.“While Burberry was relatively unscathed from the period of protests and political unrest in Hong Kong, it’s apparent there is no escaping the impact of the coronavirus as parts of the country are virtually shut down,” Helal Miah said.“While no financial impact assessment has been released by management, investors should brace themselves for a material hit to full-year profits.”Several other luxury goods companies have also said the impact the virus was hampering their businesses in the important region.Tapestry, the company behind Kate Spade and Coach, said sales had fallen and profits would be lower than previously forecast.Morningstar’s equity analyst, Jelena Sokolova, predicted the short-term effect of the virus on luxury goods sales would be more severe than the Sars outbreak in 2002-03."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aca33690a189dc4c887cb2a85e94cefbedf3be40/0_268_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5861c7a25f533a99946f2170dd7b10e9","title":"uk house prices rising property market halifax","story":"UK house prices are rising at their fastest annual rate for nearly two years, according to Halifax, prompting claims that the property market is heading into the crucial spring season in reasonable shape.Market commentators have talked about a “Boris bounce” in housing activity since the election in mid-December, and the new figures come days after Nationwide pointed to a revival in fortunes, with data showing annual price growth at a 14-month high.However, Halifax was a little less upbeat than some analysts, saying that while a number of market indicators were showing signs of improvement, “it is too early to say if a corner has been turned”.Russell Galley, the lender’s managing director, added: “The recent positive figures may actually represent activity that would ordinarily have been expected to take place last year, but was delayed by economic uncertainty.”Halifax expects only a “moderate” rate of price growth this year. However, it said demand for homes was likely to continue to exceed the supply of properties for sale, and that levels of home-building were “subdued”, with both of these factors likely to add to upwards price pressure.The Halifax figures show that despite 2019 being viewed by many as a challenging year, the typical UK home is currently worth £9,000 more than it was in January 2019, when the average price was £230,784.Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and former residential chairman at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: “Halifax confirms what we have been seeing at the sharp end since just before the election: that there is a modest recovery under way.” He added that the improvement was “patchy”, with a more sustained uplift only likely if there was an increase in the supply of homes for sale.Jonathan Hopper, the managing director of Garrington Property Finders, said: “This is encouraging, rather than explosive, price growth. This is a property market enjoying the first flush of spring … The question now is whether this moment in the sun will turn into real momentum.”David Westgate, the group chief executive of Andrews Property Group, said he expected demand to strengthen during the key spring period as pent-up demand started to come through. “In the past week alone, since we formally exited the EU, activity levels and sentiment have picked up even more. It’s like people have had a weight taken off their minds,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65ff8c8a085df08173ee7cdf1aa8bd81040459b9/395_0_3105_1864/master/3105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbb3009502ebeb919e50b909dce57870","title":"brexit regulation britain eu agencies sajid javid","story":"From medicines to aviation, Britain will need to replicate EU agencies, no matter what the chancellor wantsPutting the lead back in paint, the sewage back on beaches and enhancing the lethality of children’s toys. These are just some of the “opportunities” for deregulation offered in Sajid Javid’s call for the public to propose ways to erge from the EU rulebook.Slashing European regulation has long been an article of faith for the Tory party, fulfilling both its Thatcherite and Europhobic instincts. No matter that recent history – from the global financial crisis to the tragedy at Grenfell Tower – has taught us that regulation is a public good to be protected, not an evil to be eradicated.Just like Boris Johnson, Javid has learned to live outside history, eschewing any responsibility for his party’s decade in power. Brexit is presented as a fresh start for the country and the government. The idea of ergence is crucial to provide Brexit with a sense of purpose.But the truth is Brexit will create a more bureaucratic state rather than a more agile one. The UK now needs to build its own regulatory functions in Whitehall to replace those that were delegated to Brussels. From medicines to chemicals to aviation, the UK will need to replicate European agencies, no matter the chancellor’s ideological bent. Instead of sharing these regulatory functions with 27 other states, Britain will now need to shoulder the responsibility alone. Brexit will be a boon for British bureaucrats.Good regulation requires deep technical expertise. Neither the public, politicians nor commentators possess the expertise to judge whether medicines are safe or whether complex financial instruments pose a risk to economic stability. Brexit may have been the politics of the gut – the instinct that the country would be better off out – but it is only viable with a vast expansion in the number of technocrats.So what will these technocrats do? The fundamental error is to think that less burdensome regulation means a lower regulatory burden. In practice it means two sets of regulation to replace one, if the UK and the EU operate with different standards and rules – even if they are lighter touch here than across the Channel. That means complexity goes up, not down.Moreover, product markets are increasingly global, not local. So any firm that wants to export into the European single market will need to match its regulatory requirements. Products will be produced to the highest standards, not the lowest. For any goods produced here that firms want to export, deregulation is merely a mirage.There are some areas where Britain could realistically deregulate, though none are desirable. It could erode workers’ rights, lowering the cost of production. But we already have one of the most “flexible” labour markets in the world – and many Brexit voters expect more protection not less. The UK could cut back on environmental standards, but this would be inconsistent with commitments under the Paris climate agreement.While financial regulation was given effect by an EU directive, this was based on the global Basel agreements: erging from these would make the UK a pariah a little over a decade since the global financial crisis nearly tipped the world economy into a depression due to the sharp business practices of banks in the City of London as much as Wall Street. The Bank of England has always been a more important financial regulator than the European commissionThe truth is that Britain’s economic problems are the result of a failed free-market model. The path to success lies in a more active and entrepreneurial state that works in partnership with business and unions to raise productivity and unleash innovation. Our problems are of our own making. Only in the delusions of Brexit fantasists is putting the lead back in paint the way to put the great back in Great Britain.• Tom Kibasi is a writer and researcher on politics and economics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5de9e04d06d47c1e7037653b54c62e987b5b0825/0_108_5161_3097/master/5161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe0ceb74c05c7ebe9171d70f51297cc6","title":"eu green deal greenwash ursula von der leyen climate","story":"Ursula von der Leyen’s signature proposal co-opts the slogans of climate activism, but has none of the substanceEmergencies tend to reveal our true priorities. When our house is burning down or the storm waters are flooding in, we hold on to what we value most, and leave the rest behind.A decade ago, the leaders of the European Union found themselves facing such a moment. With the French and German banks falling into a black hole, they did whatever it took to save them. Between 2009 and 2013, European governments channelled €1.6tn (£1.36tn) to Europe’s bankers, while imposing stringent austerity upon the European citizens they pledged to serve. When in 2015 they realised that more support was necessary, the European Central Bank printed €2.6tn over just four years. At first, one cannot resist comparing the two sums and the priorities they reveal: more than €4.2tn to save Europe’s financial sector €1tn to save our world.But things are far worse than that. Whereas the €4.2tn for the financiers was new, actual funding, the €1tn that Von der Leyen has promised across 10 years in her green deal – €100bn annually – is mostly smoke and mirrors.Contrary to Von der Leyen’s pledge to deliver a “green investment wave”, the green deal is largely composed of reshuffled money from existing EU funds and reheated promises to mobilise private-sector capital down the road. In total, the green deal will generate just €7.5bn in new budget commitments, stretched over seven years. By way of comparison, the commission is set to spend €29bn – almost four times more – on “unnecessary” and environmentally destructive gas projects, according to a recent study. So much for a lunar landing.Looking at it dispassionately, Europe’s green deal fails to inspire on all three important criteria: size, composition and scope.The composition of the green deal is another cause for despair. The so-called sustainable Europe investment plan waxes lyrical in the language of “mobilisation”, pledging to unlock billions of privately held euros in the interests of sustainable investment. Much like the Juncker plan before it, the green deal proposes to encourage private investment by shifting risk from privateers to the EU budget. But this does not reduce risk – it simply shifts it on to the shoulders of the European public, while ensuring that private investors enjoy all of the gains. Without a plan to coordinate energy production and distribution within a proper energy union, the commission’s commitment to private capital promises only to intensify inequalities within and between member states.This brings us to the green deal’s scope. On paper, the plan looks impressively holistic, from a “farm to fork” sustainable food strategy to a “new circular economy action plan”. However, its capacity to transform Europeans’ lives is circumscribed by the commission’s commitment to the austerian straitjacket of the “stability and growth pact”, which has condemned Europe to chronic stagnation. Valdis Dombrovskis, the commissioner at the helm of the green deal’s investment plan, has said that he is keen to avoid the “isive debate” of loosening fiscal rules.In short, the Green Deal is a plan for preservation, not transformation.The so-called “just transition mechanism” – the commission’s plan to support communities negatively affected by the shift away from fossil fuels – illustrates this logic of preservation. Von der Leyen has pitched the just transition mechanism as a “pledge of solidarity and fairness”. But to whom? Will there be “justice” for the communities across Germany and France that have been asked to shoulder the costs of the climate transition? Does it speak to the swathes of Greek or Portuguese people who cannot afford to care about carbon emissions in 2050, preoccupied as they are with making ends meet this week? The stark answer is no.The just transition mechanism will “mobilise” a total of €100bn over 10 years towards coal-producing countries such as Hungary and Poland, which expect to see a “very significant part” of the funding. Support for coal-dependent regions is an essential dimension of the just transition. But it does not take a cynic to see that the deployment of just transition funding in the green deal is a pork-barrel payoff to rightwing governments that supported Von der Leyen’s election and who she fears might throw a ner into her signature proposal. Entrusting these governments to deliver the just transition – given their extensive track record of corruption and abuse of EU funds – seems unwise.Von der Leyen is fond of speaking about the green deal as a big structural change. “Our goal is to reconcile the economy with our planet,” she has said. But at the same time, the EU has approved and supported the construction of a multibillion-euro pipeline to transport gas between Israel and the EU, passing through the debtor’s prison in which the Greek people continue to languish.Climate activists will not be placated. In Brussels and around the world, the calls for a genuine green new deal continue to grow louder. They will not allow the EU green deal to co-opt their slogans while excluding their substance. Because this is an emergency, and a “greenwashed” status quo is simply not enough.• Yanis Varoufakis is the co-founder, and David Adler is the policy coordinator, of DiEM25 (Democracy in Europe Movement 2025)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03c477f45e7cc38bb7166f1a6c30af598ec112b7/0_61_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfe853320756bacfdc6ed8992df8dd40","title":"loneliness social connect local communities","story":"More than 2 million adults suffer from chronic loneliness and although its most severe form is more prevalent among Britain’s oldest citizens, younger adults report loneliness more  than any other age group.A desire for social connection is fundamentally hardwired into our psychology, and so being deprived of it has devastating mental and physical consequences. Yet we live in a society which has become ever more fragmented and atomised. This coincides with the decline of Britain’s industrial era. Though this period was male-dominated, and the work often physically damaging, whole communities were based around mines, docks and factories. Call centres, supermarkets, office blocks and zero-hours work do not provide the same social connections.Indeed, in that era the problem was often the opposite of loneliness: of claustrophobia, of everyone knowing what everyone else was up to. Jobs have become more precarious and staff turnover has increased while union membership has plummeted, weakening workplace solidarity.The social spaces where we congregate and connect are dying. In the 1970s, there were more than 4,000 working men’s clubs just 1,300 remain. A quarter of Britain’s pubs have closed since the beginning of the century. Nightlife is withering: in 2018 alone, the number of British nightclubs fell by a fifth. The decade-long fall in young people’s living standards has robbed them of their collective spaces: hundreds of youth centres have closed their doors. And almost 800 libraries have been axed in the decade of austerity.Nonbelievers may welcome the collapse in British religiosity, but the decline in church attendance has meant that the chance to chat each week with other people has vanished.Is this unravelling of social connections inevitable and irreversible? On Tuesday night at the Old Red Lion pub in Kennington, south London, there were people in their 80s chatting to women six decades younger. This was the local group of The Cares Family: an initiative bringing together older locals and young professionals in urban areas. The pub gives everyone a free drink, and they mingle: I found myself chatting to a woman born in 1939 who fought for equal pay in the 60s, and another who became isolated after spending years caring for her ill mother, and now fears there will be no one to care for her at the end of life.Here is an imaginative attempt to overcome loneliness and bridge Britain’s generational ide. “I think obviously there’s a big difference between being lonely and being isolated,” says Annie, a 26-year-old volunteer from Bath. “It’s easy to feel lonely ... in London everyone is doing their own thing. But older people are genuinely isolated: there’s no social structure around them, they often don’t have family and friends around them.”Here are clubs that build connections, and self-confidence too. Activities range from singing in choirs to script reading. Some attract 150 people, young and old in equal numbers, ranging from working-class white residents from “old London” to first-generation migrants.The Cares Family is the brainchild of Alex Smith, a former Labour activist who met an octogenarian named Fred while door-knocking for a council election. Fred had never missed an election before, but he hadn’t been able to leave the house in three months: so Alex wheeled him to the polling station, watching as Fred waved and smiled at people he hadn’t seen for ages.Alex discovered that Fred had once run a fancy-dress shop in Camden Town that he visited in his youth. “I realised there were a lot of people like Fred,” Alex explains, with deep historic community connections but few current ones. And though Alex had “loads of connections” on social media, his community roots had “frayed or gone unattended in the rush of working life and digitisation”. This network has helped transform lives: Alex cites an older woman who would ask a cab driver to drop her off outside a chippy so she could chat to people coming and going now she has somewhere she can establish meaningful connections. Here’s a community network that makes clear that the long drift towards isolation is not inevitable. All of us need to connect with others, even as society has robbed us of opportunities to do so. An atomised, fragmented society is not simply sad – something to passively mourn – but contributes to a major public health crisis. Loneliness is devastating our mental and physical health and, at its worst, is killing us. Yet thankfully, unlike some conditions, we can easily cure it. We just need the will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce6ed075603cb6aacc27a8f7818c78d90ad69431/0_204_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=880495d05d05653fd7a255ca54b11227","title":"climate activists bring trojan horse to british museum","story":"Activists dressed as warriors protest against corporate sponsorship deal with oil firmActivists have taken a Trojan horse into the grounds of the British Museum to protest against its sponsorship deal with the oil corporation BP.Protesters dressed as ancient Greek warriors snuck their 13ft-tall wooden horse through a side gate at 7.30am on Friday and pulled it on to the forecourt in front of the museum’s entrance.The installation – based on the wooden horse in the ancient Greek myth of the siege of Troy – was timed to coincide with the museum’s latest exhibition, Troy: Myth and Reality, which is described as “supported by BP”.“The Troy exhibition has inspired us to create this magnificent beast, because the Trojan horse is the perfect metaphor for BP sponsorship,” said Helen Glynn, an activist with the theatrical protest group BP or not BP?. “On its surface the sponsorship looks like a generous gift, but inside lurks death and destruction.”The activists have asked the museum to allow them to keep the wooden horse outside the front door until Saturday, when a bigger demonstration is planned.In a letter handed to the museum, they said: “Hundreds of people have helped to crowdfund this horse because they feel so strongly that the museum should not be promoting and giving legitimacy to an oil company when we are in the midst of a climate emergency.“The museum has previously said that it will facilitate peaceful protest and we want to work with you to make sure that our interactive artwork enhances tomorrow’s event.”The museum said it was awaiting advice from the police.The protest is the latest move in activists’ campaign to end fossil fuel sponsorship of the UK’s leading cultural institutions.

These simple steps will help to cultivate an inclusive organisationBut ersity isn’t limited to a candidate’s race, gender, or age – it includes their education, socioeconomic background, sexuality, religion, mental and physical health and many more facets. When we create environments that encourage different opinions and contain a multitude of backgrounds and experiences, we broaden our communities, which in turn benefits both the work and the culture of the organisation.Here’s how to get started with building an inclusive and erse business:Look outside of the obvious education channelsThis may come as a surprise, but where someone studied - for their qualifications – doesn’t necessarily correlate to their qualities as a candidate. It’s important to be intentional about recruitment, and if you are only accepting candidates who have a certain level of education, or attended a certain type of university, you may be missing out on someone just right for the job. Go further afield when you attend university job fairs and remember to think digitally. With an increasing number of courses being offered online, make sure you connect with those graduates as well. The Open University has been offering qualifications through distance learning for 50 years. It has an excellent resource – the OU’s OpportunityHub, which connects prospective employers with graduates and alumni around the country for work and internships. The OU also regularly runs OU Online TalentConnect, a digital careers fair where employers can chat and interact with its uniquely erse body of graduates and undergraduates all over the UK and internationally.“The OU provides a unique supply of candidates, as a majority study alongside full-time employment – it shows a true commitment and a willingness to go that extra mile,” says the HMRC’s Memunatu Bangura.Create a ersity, equity, and inclusion committeeHave a specific committee to oversee ersity, equity, and inclusion at your organisation, to ensure that not only the roles you are hiring, but the work that you do appeals to a broad group of people. Of course, ersity isn’t just about hiring – but it’s probably a good idea to ensure that the team responsible for hiring are erse themselves.Could the role be remote? Or part-time?For many candidates, especially those with disabilities, knowing that a job can be done remotely, or part-time, is deeply attractive. You can also sign up to be a part of the Disability Confident programme, which signals to jobseekers with disabilities that your organisation supports and encourages a talent pool that is inclusive. When pulling together your job description, think seriously about whether it would be possible to offer remote work, or a job share – many parents benefit from flexible schedules.Consider mature studentsNot everyone attends university. Many candidates from lower-income backgrounds, or BAME candidates, may not have been given the same access to opportunity as others, and many people choose to attend university later in life, if at all. Mature students are defined as being undergraduates over the age of 21, and they account for almost 300,000 people a year. According to Ucas, the majority of mature students are women who live at home, undertaking degrees in vocational subjects. These are candidates who will have learned to juggle work, or parenting, alongside their studies.“We want to work with OU students and graduates because we know they are highly motivated and talented iniduals who have the potential to make an enormous contribution to Mencap as either staff or volunteers. We work across England, Wales and Northern Ireland and we know that OU students are spread across the whole of the UK too,” says Jen Stoneman, volunteer services coordinator at Mencap.Be realistic about your goalsWhile it would be amazing to cultivate a erse work environment, it won’t happen overnight. Be patient, and set metrics of success that ensure that you are appealing to erse groups, and growing your workforce.

Mercury-free LED light bulbs were said to produce significantly poorer levels of lighting, but it is now claimed that the technology has sufficiently moved on.Brussels’ next move is being billed as a test of its stated commitment to fighting the climate crisis.“Sweden’s main concern is that there are no legal grounds for renewing an exemption for the use in questions,” a letter from the Swedish government to the commission stated on 22 January. “Today there are economically viable substitutes available for most of the mercury-containing light sources.”In 2017, the EU signed the Minamata convention obliging it to reduce the use of toxic materials such as mercury. The Swedish government argued in its letter that Brussels risked being in breach of its legal obligations.“Sweden also doubts that renewing the exemptions for mercury in question would be in line with the goal on climate neutrality and the ambitions on chemicals of the green deal recently launched by the commission”, its government added, citing the 40.9m metric tonnes of CO2 emissions savings that would be delivered by phasing mercury out by September 2021.The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in December that the premise of the so-called European Green Deal targeting a “climate-neutral continent” by 2050 was that the “old growth model that is based on fossil fuels and pollution is out of date”. She described it as Europe’s “man on the moon moment” as she laid out 50 policies to revamp EU rules and regulations. Discussions among the member states, the commission and stake-holders on mercury-bearing lamps are due to continue next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0762fd43b844d92de49c7c116864573f02fc0989/47_0_2832_1700/master/2832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f99a0e4cc1b1d1c6e9b89235a9202649","title":"modern ark designs for the new climate reality in pictures","story":"Floating villages and an ‘amphibious house’ are among some of the solutions as architecture adapts to the growing problem of urban flooding• Sea Change: Flood Resilient Architecture for the 21st Century is at the Roca London Gallery, until 16 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a78a36996db8d836619fa22ad30fb24741917c/855_1101_2903_1742/master/2903.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=435fbe724b6d2a0bd846df4ff28e5774","title":"how to wear glasual jess cartner morley","story":"I’m introducing a new dress code: glamorous but casual.

It’s all very well, in principle, being free to do your own thing, go your own way, choose your own path, etc. But sometimes it would be quite helpful to have guard rails to hang on to when you are at risk of falling flat on your face and making an idiot of yourself in public, you know?So I’m introducing a new dress code, which we can call glasual. Meaning, obviously, glamorous but casual. Glasual is completely different from smart casual, in case you were wondering. Smart casual is about bringing a dash of formality to a casual look. Glasual is about bringing a dash of extra fun, added energy, instead. Smart casual is serving up a vodka tonic with a neat slice of lime and a linen napkin on the side. Glasual is adding an extra slosh of vodka.Glasual is the jazz-hands of the dress code scene. It’s about clothes that bring a bit of joy. These are clothes to wear because you are seeing your friends and your friends are brilliant. Or because you’re going to work, but it’s Friday. Because you are excited to be going to a party. Or because you would actually really rather stay home but you’ve promised you’ll go, and dressing up will help you get in the party mood.

Start with a wardrobe template you feel comfortable in (whether that’s jeans and a top, or a dress) and add something extra. The shirt I’m wearing here is an ancient J Crew buy, which has become one of my wardrobe get-out-of-jail-free cards, the piece I always pack because it can turn any number of outfits around. It is fancy, but it doesn’t take itself too seriously. Layered under a sweater, as here, or on its own under a simple blazer, it adds just the right amount of silliness.A fancy skirt is another good glasual option. If there’s a sequined, fringed or feathered skirt in your wardrobe, don’t file it away as eveningwear to be worn with a tuxedo at some hypothetical event: wear it out to lunch with a pristine T-shirt and loafers, or to the pub with a sweatshirt and ankle boots. Major earrings can make a white shirt glasual a posh jacket can do the same for a pair of jeans. Think of it like hot sauce for your wardrobe: just a dash, and you’re good and spicy.

This generation’s Chariots of Fire, say, or The English Patient. But its success hinges on a certain cultural amnesia which has not affected one of its chief rivals, Joker.Unlike Joker 1917 has been relatively untainted by controversy: it is not a film accused of inciting incels. The other knock on Joker has been that it is Todd Phillips doing Scorsese karaoke, that it is a facsimile of other, better films. But the same is true of 1917.Like 1917, Peter Weir’s 1981 film Gallipoli is about two young men, one worldlier than the other, making a perilous cross-country trek that (spoiler alert) only one survives, ending with a desperate sprint through the trenches. The hero in both films is running not for his own life but that of his fellow soldiers, with a message to abort an imminent attack. In each case he fails to reach his destination before the first wave goes over. No less a critic than Pauline Kael described Gallipoli with lethal politeness, as “an exemplary academic film about the waste of war”. The film is held up as a classic in Australia, but less well remembered in the US. To its credit, 1917 takes some of those elements and welds them to a new, or at least newly fashionable, form. Mendes has spoken of his admiration for Alfonso Cuarón’s Children of Men, and the long takes in that film have since become de rigueur. The natural extension of the long take is the single-shot film – or the pretend single-shot film, as in 1917 and Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Oscar-winning Birdman. Mendes owes a debt, too, to Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk, with which 1917 shares an editor (Lee Smith), a ticking-clock structure and the emphasis on spectacle over character that marks a blockbuster built for international markets.All of which would be fine, if 1917 wasn’t being hailed as groundbreaking. Yet the film’s acceleration to pole position in the Oscar race can be attributed, I think, to the fact that all that technical ingenuity is exercised in service of a familiar, comforting story. (As well as the degree to which its studio backers hves publicised the difficulty of its production – the same rules have long applied in the acting categories). It’s a tale of heroism in the manner of 2016’s Hacksaw Ridge, only this particular war has been thoughtfully airbrushed: you’ll never hear a quieter medic’s tent than the one Mendes gives us. Screams are conspicuously absent, never mind that the company has just been ambushed in no man’s land.It ends with our hero wandering from tent to tree, slumping against one in an image that echoes the film’s first. There’s a striking romanticism to the scene – a return to nature after the horrors of the trenches, explicitly tied to a yearning for home: away from Europe and back to England. Mendes would surely bristle at the parallel, but 1917 ends with the same kind of nostalgia for a green and pleasant land that attracted people to Brexit (not to mention Midsomer Murders). And it’s a hankering for that same kind of Britishness that might help explain its appeal.In contrast, Gallipoli dramatised a military disaster that is seen as the moment in which a young country realised the motherland couldn’t be trusted. But as any member of a former colony will tell you, sentimental deference dies hard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/657ae9e1e67e35d277b16f0a8fff61c48d516b91/0_181_2732_1640/master/2732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8b628c4bd90c4560e81f5341f682dc5","title":"parasite review bong joon ho south korean satire","story":"Members of an unemployed family target a wealthy household in Bong Joon-ho’s superbly written, horribly fascinating comedy-dramaIn all its delicious cruelty and ingenuity, Bong Joon-ho’s satirical suspense thriller Parasite has arrived in the UK from Korea, having won the Palme d’Or in Cannes last year and dominated the connoisseur conversation from then on – at the expense, rightly or wrongly, of every other non-English-language film.This really is a horribly fascinating film, brilliantly written, superbly furnished and designed, with a glorious ensemble cast put to work in an elegantly plotted nightmare. Its narrative engine hums with the luxurious smoothness of the Mercedes-Benz that one character is fatefully given the chance to drive. In my original review from Cannes, I wondered if the narrative was a little over-extended, but, on a second viewing, I can see how that amplitude of detail is what gives the film its flavour.Parasite is a scabrous black comedy-slash-farce that resonates beyond its generic limits – a movie about status envy, aspiration, materialism, the patriarchal family unit and the idea of having (or leasing) servants. More than this, it is about the suppressed horror of the overclass for its underlings and its morbid distaste for the smell of people who have to use public transport. The satirical reflex extends to a vision of South and North Korea living together in paranoid, resentful intimacy, and its climax is precipitated by an almost Biblical climate-emergency catastrophe.The parasites in question are a dodgy unemployed family living together in a scuzzy, stinky basement flat, with the teenage son and daughter periodically roaming around, holding their smartphones up to the ceiling to pinch the non-password-protected wifi of neighbours and nearby businesses. The dad is Ki-taek (a lovely performance from veteran player Song Kang-ho), a laidback loafer married to former track star Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin). The son is Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), a shiftless young guy who has flunked the university entrance exams and the daughter is Ki-jung (Park So-dam), a smart, cool customer with an artistic gift for web-based fraud.One summer, by posing as a college student, Ki-woo gets the chance to tutor the teenage daughter of a very rich family in a spectacularly grand modernist house, owned by business high-flier Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun). Ki-woo’s student is the demure Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), whose instant crush on him is something Ki-woo does nothing to discourage. The somewhat distraite mistress of the house, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), asks if this smart young man might also recommend an art tutor for Da-hye’s negligibly talented kid brother Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). He passes off his sister as the cousin of a friend and her brazen grifter-sense of when and how to be confident, and even arrogant, bags her the job.Soon, these wicked kids have cunningly contrived to get the family chauffeur fired and replaced with their dad. They then dislodge the housekeeper Moon-gwang (Lee Jeong-eun) and install their placidly smiling mum. A whole family of cuckoos in a brand new nest, pretending to be strangers to each other. But then the artless little kid points out that they all smell alike – and they smell of poor people.Parasite is a movie that taps into a rich cinematic tradition of unreliable servants with an intimate knowledge of their employers, an intimacy that easily, and inevitably, congeals into hostility. Joseph Losey’s The Servant invokes a comparable transgression, nightmarishly amplified here by the subterfuge and by the sheer numbers of people getting up close and personal.Parasite is also in a Korean tradition of pictures such as Kim Ki-young’s classic thriller The Housemaid from 1960, remade in 2010 by Im Sang-soo, and also Park Chan-wook’s servant-class con-trick drama, The Handmaiden. A second viewing of this film also put me in mind of the claustrophobic horror in Park’s Oldboy.And there is something else, too. The Park family love to play Handel on the music system in their lovely home – the Spietati, io vi giurai aria from his opera Rodelinde. It is so expansive, so airy, caressingly sumptuous and wealthy, and not a million miles from the Care selve arioso from Handel’s Atalanta – listened to by the smug wealthy couple in Michael Haneke’s home-invasion horror Funny Games, before their own appointment with dark destiny.The home invaders here gaze on their super-rich employers and see themselves in a distorting mirror that pitilessly reveals to them how wretched they are and shows them what could and should be theirs. It is almost a supernatural or sci-fi story: the invasion of the lifestyle snatchers. Parasite gets its toxic tendrils into your skin.• Parasite is released in the UK on 7 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/641c1532389e74364780dc06d05a401e7210f9db/1_0_2956_1774/master/2956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=005922c143fa86f82f06c0d810950bf3","title":"swag charm and birthday party invites how to win an oscar in 2020","story":"When a star gets their hands on a golden statuette on Sunday, it will be the results of meticulous planning, relentless charm – and millions of dollars. (Oh, and acting, too)Buried in the endearingly manic jumble of thoughts and dedications in Olivia Colman’s dumbfounded Oscar acceptance speech last year – the one sealed as a classic by its panicked shoutout to Lady Gaga at the very end – was a telling thank-you that went largely overlooked. “And to Bryna,” Colman said, “who made me do things that I said ‘no’ to, but she was right.” It underlined the fact that Colman’s surprise victory over the frontrunner, Glenn Close, was not just a happy stroke of luck, but the result of a long and expertly calculated campaign.The Bryna in question was Bryna Rifkin, the Hollywood publicist extraordinaire and dab hand at steering stars through the almost six-month marathon of “awards season”, from the essential autumn trio of buzz-building autumn festivals (Venice, Telluride, Toronto) to Oscars night. Rifkin’s client list is elite: in addition to Colman, she has in recent years carried the likes of Marion Cotillard, Ruth Negga, Willem Dafoe and Michael Shannon to against-the-odds Oscars recognition. All would have been put on a rigorous circuit of interviews, roundtables, talkshow spots and dressy appearances at umpteen precursor events and lesser award ceremonies – the very things a perennially working and not especially attention-seeking character actor such as Colman might have “said ‘no’ to”, only to be persuaded by a determined PR team that visibility is the key to victory.Such promotion does not come cheap – $5m (£3.8m) is a typical cost for a single Oscar campaign, although for studios hungry and deep-pocketed enough, the sky is the limit. It is estimated that Netflix, still a relative newcomer to this game, spent upwards of $25m last year in its efforts to secure a best picture win for Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma – another critically adored, non-English-language arthouse film that didn’t look or feel much like a typical Oscar frontrunner, and thus needed a concerted push from its distributor to make voters view it as such.The all-out campaign included all manner of Roma-related swag, from throw cushions to lush coffee table books, sent out to voters and journalists. And it worked – up to a point. It won three Oscars, but fell at the final hurdle to the cosily old-fashioned and very American Green Book – which not only spent a bit less money on the way, but weathered a variety of PR crises, including excavated #MeToo stories of the film’s director, Peter Farrelly, flashing his penis on the set of past productions, and an Islamophobic tweet from the screenwriter, Nick Vallelonga.When Roma lost, some pundits speculated that voters had been put off by Netflix’s overeager campaigning, although given the obstacles the film was already up against – including industry wariness of the streaming model and the Academy’s general phobia of subtitles – it can’t have lost more than it gained.The Golden Globes are another kind of race entirely. Eyebrows were raised last month when Taron Egerton won the Globe for best actor in a musical or comedy – not because his committed performance as Elton John in Rocketman was undeserving of the honour, but because of reports circulating on social media that all 90 voting members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) had been invited to a reception for the film that also happened to be on his birthday. Nine years ago, an unlikely best-picture Globe nomination for the riotous CherChristina Aguilera campfest Burlesque probably had a little something to do with the fact that Sony had flown out HFPA members for a Cher concert and hotel stay in Las Vegas.Egerton didn’t get an Oscar nomination. (Nor did Burlesque, for that matter, to this writer’s eternal disappointment.) Wooing Academy members is a subtler art more about making them believe they love your film on their own terms. The disgraced Harvey Weinstein, once the master of opportunistic Oscar campaigning, knew this better than anyone. Spending an alleged $15m (at the time, a jaw-dropping industry record) on campaigning for the frothily charming period romcom Shakespeare in Love was the gamechanger that shaped the awards-season machine as we know it today: it beat Steven Spielberg’s solemnly macho frontrunner, Saving Private Ryan, to the prize on the strength of a cynically ingenious “love v war” campaign line that persuaded voters that the lighter contender was the one truly in their hearts. (The same year, a similarly button-pushing Miramax campaign for Life Is Beautiful netted it three wins, proving the Academy’s aversion to foreign-language fare can be overcome if the film is sweetened enough.)Weinstein may be persona non grata, but his tactics endure. A recent campaign pivot for Joker, which leads the field with 11 Oscar nominations – but is also one of the most polarising contenders in recent memory – is worthy of the character himself: yes, the violent, nihilistic supervillain origin story is attempting a touchy-feely rebrand. Last week, as Oscar voting opened, a glossy sheaf of Warner Bros-sponsored content on the film’s behalf appeared in the industry trade bible, Variety, headed by a feature titled A Case for Empathy, talking up the film’s themes of class ision and mental health awareness, and going so far as to conclude with a Gandhi quote: “The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.”It was the most brazen development yet in a campaign that has even turned the rebellious, publicity-shy nature of its star, Joaquin Phoenix (now the best-actor favourite), into a strategic advantage – with his unpredictable acceptance speeches (including his scorching attack on industry racism at the Baftas) and interview walkouts projecting the very image of anxious outsider-hood that Joker’s admirers respond to in its troubled hero. Is that just Phoenix being Phoenix or is it his own kind of anti-campaign strategy, the equally winning opposite of Colman’s funny, agreeable compliance? In this racket, it’s increasingly hard to tell. If he loses in an upset to Marriage Story’s star, Adam Driver, however, look no further than Driver’s publicist – one Bryna Rifkin – for an explanation.Judy Garland was the one to beat. Her all-stops-out, career-best performance in a Star Is Born movingly reflected her own career ups and downs, and the Oscars ceremony directors were so confident of her victory that they sent a camera crew to the hospital room where she had just given birth to her third child. Kelly emerged the winner for her against-type role as a dowdy, put-upon housewife in The Country Girl, proving the Academy’s eternal preference for unblemished ingenues over complicated legends – particularly when they are “brave” enough to strip away their glamour on screen.It looked like a tight race between the four highbrow non-US stars nominated: Judy Davis was the critics’ choice, Joan Plowright the sentimental favourite, Miranda Richardson the ubiquitous breakout who was in everything that year and Vanessa Redgrave the beneficiary of best-picture heat for Howards End. Instead, in a classic vote-split scenario, they gave way to the one nominee who was not like the others: the Brooklyn-born newcomer Marisa Tomei for a brashly hilarious comic turn in the very mainstream My Cousin Vinny. Cruel rumours persisted for years that the award’s presenter, Jack Palance, had read the wrong name in retrospect, voters simply chose the most entertaining performance.Jack Nicholson’s ever-expressive eyebrows shot up a mile when he opened the best picture envelope to reveal the title of Paul Haggis’s tortuously contrived “everyone’s a little bit racist” parable. Ang Lee’s acclaimed cowboy love story, Brokeback Mountain, had swept all the other prizes that season, and seemed poised to make history as the first overtly LGBT film to win the top Oscar. But word of a homophobic backlash from the Academy’s more conservative members had been circulating in the industry: veteran stars Ernest Borgnine and Tony Curtis evidently spoke for many when they said they refused to see Lee’s film, and that faction tipped the balance.Two types of films tend to win the best visual effects Oscar these days: lavishly expensive blockbuster spectacles or best-picture contenders looking to add another trophy to their haul. (Ideally, both.) Nominated against Star Wars: The Force Awakens, The Martian, The Revenant and Mad Max: Fury Road, Alex Garland’s low-budget, minimalist British sci-fi didn’t seem to have a prayer. But the work that went into creating Alicia Vikander’s sentient humanoid robot was so plainly ingenious and essential to her much-admired performance – it helped she was that year’s It-girl, winning that night for another film – that it pulled off a true David-v-Goliath shocker.The circumstances of Moonlight’s win were themselves so stunning – as Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway erroneously declared La La Land the victor, only to be corrected minutes later – it’s easy to forget just how breathtaking a moment it would have been anyway. Barry Jenkins’ melancholy study of gay black masculinity seemed destined all season long to finish second to Damien Chazelle’s vibrant LA musical, which landed a record 14 nominations and led 6-2 in wins as the final envelope was opened. But, in the wake of Donald Trump’s election victory, Academy members were perhaps in a more pensive, socially conscious mood, enabling a historic win."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bcce022b655bb7a9134bc751a0c74661dd1ec12/554_410_3236_1942/master/3236.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08dba0cb94731d6d2f4c47bd9c617a57","title":"why once upon a time in hollywood should win the best picture oscar","story":"Tarantino’s cinematic ode to the movie industry is so relaxed it is barely a film at all and there are scenes that will stay with you for daysOne of the highlights of the final furlong of awards season is the Hollywood Reporter’s Brutally Honest Oscar Ballot series, in which Scott Feinberg talks outrageous truths out of an anonymous voter (whose identity Twitter then scurries to guess).The first one this year was quite the corrective for all those who thought 1917 was a lock-in for best picture – unless Parasite were to dazzlingly pip it. Turns out, both of those movies are just too goddamn foreign. Sam Mendes’s 1917 might be fine for the Baftas but the Oscars are an American bash and a Yank has got to win in order to make Hollywood great again.It’s a reminder that Quentin Tarantino’s ninth film really does tick a lot of Oscar boxes. It’s about Hollywood, obviously no film since The Artist has lavished so much airtime on the mechanics of the movie biz, nor riffed so lovingly on its folklore.It stars men – and a woman – that the industry adores. It flatters its audience with the assumption of enough cultural knowledge to indulge its spoof inserts and that final act rug-pull. Aside from some fairly uncontroversial scepticism about Charles Manson, it studiously avoids politics. And it offers voters an opportunity to fete Tarantino, one of their own, slightly-unsung prodigal sons – a tamed yet still spunky enfant terrible who’s just about to become a dad.To be honest, I have long harboured a loathing for Tarantino – the man maybe more than his movies, though I’ve never gone nuts for those either. Pulp Fiction is overcooked Kill Bill tension free Inglorious Basterds flat-out awful. But the problems I had with his back catalogue – especially the fetish-level self-indulgence and sniggering revisionism – evaporated here.I think that’s mostly on account of pace: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is so relaxed as to be barely a film at all, while also being the most obviously cinematic contender. It is both an episodic meander and a formally stringent genre fairytale. It is all about the feeling: of being a hot and charming washed-up stuntman with the warm breeze flowing through your gorgeous hair as you fix an aerial on a Beverley Hills mansion. Of being a hot and charming 26-year-old starlet, married to Roman Polanski, feeling the warm breeze flow through your gorgeous hair as you zip through traffic-free freeways in an open-top motor, off to the hottest party in town.And if its actual narrative is all over the shop, it functions just fine as a delivery vehicle for scenes that stay with you for days: the humbling of Leonardo DiCaprio by a child star Pitt scoping out a derelict movie ranch Margot Robbie gleeful at seeing her own character up on the big screen (hat-tip to Tarantino for leaving Sharon Tate in the movie, rather than artfully substituting his own star).In its extreme auteurish extravagance, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is absolutely uncompromising. It is also a manifesto: baked into the movie is the line Tarantino has been trotting since its release – that he, like Scorsese, is a celluloid defender, a crusader against the dark forces of the franchise. That might ring a little hollow. But it will still be music to many voters’ ears. Mine too, for once. Few, it seems, can carry a tune quite like Tarantino."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fbd0623f60962bb181e9253c0c7de9d4bf68fdc/0_230_2798_1677/master/2798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b7e02f57f0410656d3823d4e6fc64fd","title":"kirk douglas a life in pictures","story":"Kirk Douglas, the last great star of Hollywood’s golden age, once said he had ‘made a career playing sons of bitches’, a career that began in 1946 with the film The Strange Love of Martha Ivers.

Is sourdough the only way to go? Should the ’shrooms be creamed or naked? And is a flat white the ultimate drink pairing?As recently chronicled in the , the mushroom is having a moment, and nowhere more so than in Antipodean-inspired brunch cafes, where meat is in retreat and avocados, eggs and sweetcorn fritters are in the ascendancy. Packed with beneficial nutrients and so sustainable you can grow them in spent coffee grounds (creating a virtuous breakfast circle), mushrooms are set to play an ever bigger part in our mornings.Like the bacon sandwich or boiled egg, mushrooms on toast is a dish of such seeming simplicity you may wonder how it warrants How to Eat’s attention. How will it support 1,500 words of painfully verbose, serio-comic riffing? But at How to Eat the deliciousness is in the detail. For instance, two plain, baked flat mushrooms on Warburton’s toastie loaf is, technically, mushrooms on toast. But is that the dish that celebrity fans such as Nigel Slater, Timothy Spall and Victoria Coren fell in love with? It is certainly not a plate you would happily pay £7 for in your local hipster café (after drone yoga, Weds 7.30am). Not without asking: “Oi, tattoos, where’s the rest of it?”So, without further ado, it is time for How to Eat (HTE) to put the fun in fungi and adjudicate on mushrooms on toast.Disclaimer: much as HTE loves the picture of Britain painted in this American article, of a nation of Siobhans habitually foraging their own mushrooms, please don’t. It will likely be a waste of time in built-up Bolton or Birmingham (pro tip: try the supermarket), or you may die. Eight years in, HTE cannot afford to lose any more readers. We are barely quorate here as it is.The meatier the mushrooms, the mightier the dish that is, both meaty in texture and in their bosky woodland flavours. They have their uses elsewhere, but in this case avoid mushrooms that can take on a flabby, chewy consistency, such as oyster, hen of the woods, girolles and shimeji. Instead, use stocky, muscular varieties such as chestnut or shiitake, bulked out if necessary with field or cup, and, perhaps, given a given a bit of extra bottom-end weight in the bass cabinets (note: it is often useful to think of a dish as a dub reggae soundsystem), by adding a few dried, rehydrated wild porcini.Chop everything into broadly uniform bite-sized chunks. You do not want a jumble of mushrooms ranging from minuscule to XXL pieces you struggle to manoeuvre into your mouth. Cook with care so that, beyond their silky surfaces, those earthy mushrooms retain a toothsome bite.To be precise, this entry should be titled creamed mushrooms on toast. You can fry your mushrooms in A Fat of Your Choosing (it should be butter and plenty of it) and simply plonk them on toast, but why deny yourself the pleasure of also enrobing them in something creamy? Preferably, half-fat creme fraiche, as its lactic twang is useful as we build flavour into this dish.Adding cream of some sort also helps overcome a major issue: during frying, mushrooms disgorge so much water you will struggle to drive it off. Served naked, wet mushrooms will create an unedifying damp patch in the middle of your toast. The addition of creme fraiche, however, seems to hold the sauce atop the toast for longer, slowing the rate of absorbency, preventing the bread from turning into a rank wet mulch. How does that work, you ask? Let’s call it an emulsion-cum-viscosity-type-thing-maybe. If you came here for hard science, you are reading the wrong column.In terms of additional flavourings, garlic is key, shallots or onion less so. You can crush, smoosh and generally obliterate the former into a melting paste, but, no matter how finely chopped, onions bring an itty-bitty texture to the dish that detracts from its velvet smoothness (see also, bacon shrapnel, pine nuts, chopped chives etc). For extra umami impact andor general interest, you should also vigorously reduce a splash of soy sauce, dry Marsala or other wine in your mushrooms. HTE’s preference is for soy early doors, then a squeeze of lemon just before serving to give it some top-line zip.Grated cheese is more tempting but similarly inessential. Deploy your soy efficiently and you will not need a sprinklingavalanche of parmesan or cheddar to ramp up this dish’s umami levels. In fact, go too heavy on the cheese and your ’shrooms will turn into a greasy quagmire.Adding an egg creates a similar issue. Yolk running in creamy sauce is not the sublime diary duet it appears on paper. It turns your hillock of creamed mushrooms into an overly thickened mess, while the egg white turns this already rich dish into something that eats like a precursor to gout.You could add a green side salad to make yourself feel virtuous but it will taste disgusting. Is there anything more dispiriting in food than eating iron-packed, chlorophyll-stacked leaves that have wilted in a hot, creamy sauce? It is a truly jarring experience. Like Thom Yorke supporting Taylor Swift, a misplaced Manchester City pass, Paddy McGuinness fronting Newsnight.Adding anything more substantial or radical to mushrooms on toast (please click past suggestions such as goat’s cheese, crab meat, prosciutto or leeks), turns this into an irreconcilably different animal. The only thing worse would be dressing your plate with that Brian Blessed of condiments, truffle oil. No matter how little you use, it shouts down every other flavour. Less a finishing flourish, more aerial bombardment.Take two inch-thick slices from the middle of a circular off-white sourdough boule and after toasting them to a Mediterranean tan, arrange them in a crossed V-shape*, one on top of the other. That way, you can drape your mushrooms over the “joint” in that V and ensure that a section of the bottom piece of toast remains dry. This is the section, along with the indestructibly robust crusts, that you can then use to mop up any remnants of sauce or stray mushrooms. It is the best of both worlds: the generously buttered toast will be gently softened by the creamy sauce yet, elsewhere, will remain dry enough that you can taste its lightly sour, long-fermented complexity.You could try other breads. You could try ones that appear to make sense, such as ciabatta or English muffins (too woolly, too absorbent, ultimately). If you really hate yourself, you could also try those that don’t, too (dark rye, worthy wholemeal, supermarket white sliced that will drown and disintegrate beneath those mushrooms). But with the exception of Simon Hopkinson’s beloved fried bread – worth trying, but just too much, frankly – you will always come back to sourdough.* Please invert the V so its apex is facing away from you as you eat. Only a monster would eat food that is pointing aggressively at them. And why have you made your food so angry? Because you are eating it upside down.A flat plate with a low lip to retain the sauce, but nothing deeper or curved that exists in that growing grey zone where bowls meet plates. You need a proper flat surface to work on, one that in no way inhibits your movements with a knife and fork. Put the kitchen roll on the table, too. Let’s go all out. This is a saucy dish. It can get messy.Historically, mushrooms on toast was regularly described as the ultimate “light supper”, that middle-class meal eaten mid-evening (in lieu of a proper tea, the bohemian layabouts) that baffled working-class northerners who, by that hour, had already eaten their supper – cornflakes in front of Coronation Street. But now we all work and eat at increasingly irregular hours and that confusion no longer opens up the seam of comic gold it once did. The light supper is toast. Eating a main(ish) meal at 8pm (or 4pm or 10pm) has been normalised.That is good news for mushrooms on toast, because other than before 9am, when a deeply savoury version can be a bit over-facing, it works at any time. It is big enough to fill any hunger gap, but not so heavy it will leave you prone and groaning. Quite the opposite. It is a relatively easily digestible livener. As a fan of the savoury course, HTE also recommends it as dessert, albeit in a half-size version.I know this is Britain. I know this is How to Eat. But, hey guys, we don’t have to drink alcohol with every meal, right? Because in a very satisfying case of serendipity, vis-a-vis the Oz-style brunch cafe, the flat white is the perfect partner for mushrooms on toast. In a Venn diagram they would overlap in their creaminess, but then the coffee’s smoothly modulated bitterness clears the palate of any overbearing greasiness. It’s perfection. For 20 minutes. Then you can go for a pint.So, mushrooms on toast, how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80a8628bffee220cd7ab1cb22c80b4020acad088/0_192_5632_3380/master/5632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e97a12311612ceb6e42974cb2e92301","title":"george best manchester united six goals northampton fa cup 1970","story":"The meticulousness with which even the lowliest football clubs prepare for matches these days makes Northampton’s meeting the day before their FA Cup fifth-round game against Manchester United 50 years ago seem endearingly quaint. Convening in the County Ground boardroom for sherry, the fourth ision side’s players were on a promise of a £15-a-man bonus if they could beat their top-flight opponents. Hopeful of an upset, they settled down to be briefed by the club’s scouting department, an elderly local gentleman who had gone to watch United’s most recent match.With players of the calibre of Paddy Crerand, Bobby Charlton and Brian Kidd prognosis was bleak, he told them, but if they could “nobble” Charlton they might have a chance. Sadly, Northampton’s reconnaissance man failed to mention that a 23-year-old by the name of George Best would probably be lining up against them, as the Ballon d’Or and European Cup winner had been serving a month-long ban when the scouting mission was carried out. It would prove, with the benefit of hindsight, quite the oversight.Some weeks previously, Best had incurred the wrath of the Football Association for kicking the ball out of referee Jack Taylor’s hands at the end of a League Cup match against Manchester City and been suspended for a month. It was a punishment the mercurial midfielder deemed excessive and attributed to the FA’s disapproval of his playboy lifestyle. He was further peeved by mutterings that during a subsequent five-match unbeaten streak, Manchester United were much improved in his absence.“While I’ve been suspended I’ve had letters from cranks saying that the team played better without me,” he said. “I felt if we were beaten by Northampton, people would say it was my fault.”Despite struggling against their lowly rivals for the first 20 minutes of the game played on 7 February 1970, United ran out 8-2 winners. Best, on a mission to prove his detractors wrong, chipped in with the winning margin of six goals. “I don’t really class myself as a footballer,” he said in the aftermath of the game. “I call myself an entertainer. I know a lot of people have paid to see me do something spectacular and that’s what I was trying to do on Saturday. It’s my job to do something that will send people away feeling that they’d like to see me play again.”And how. Putting his heroics into context in the following Monday’s , Albert Barham revealed that Best was the fourth player to score six in an FA Cup match. His double hat-rick wasn’t even a record, he noted, as Bill Minter had scored seven for St Albans against Dulwich Hamlet in the fourth qualifying round in 1922 and still finished on the losing side. A little under two years later, Ted McDougall would eclipse these feats by scoring nine for Bournemouth in an 11-0 first-round win over Margate.In the Observer the day after United’s win, John Heilpern had been effusive in his praise for Best. “His unique contribution made the suggestion that United play better without him look simply insane,” he wrote. “To have seen Best score those six goals is to have seen genius.”A capacity crowd of 21,711 fans was wedged into Northampton’s three-sided stadium, but few had a better view of their team’s main tormentor than Kim Book, the Northampton goalkeeper. “I have to hold my hand up for two of the goals but the rest were brilliant,” he later conceded. “When the fourth went in I thought we might just have our backs to the wall. They were a tremendous side. We all felt it was just an honour to be on the same park.” Book, the brother of Manchester City’s captain, Tony, had received a pre-match call from his sibling. “If you haven’t got anyone who can take care of George, you might have a bit of a problem,” he was advised.On match day, the sun was out but the County Ground was a quagmire, with the pitch markings practically indiscernible and barely a blade of grass to be seen. Best, unfazed by the uneven terrain on which he was forced to work his magic, at times seemed to glide above it as he set about almost singlehandedly dismantling the Cobblers.His opener was a gift, Book letting a Kidd cross from the right sail over his outstretched arms and leaving United’s No 7 with a straightforward back-post header towards the Hotel End. Latching on to a through ball from Crerand, the faintest of touches took him past Book before he fired a low diagonal shot into the corner for his second. Kidd, who scored United’s other two goals, turned provider again for goal number three, with Book weakly palming his cross into the path of Best, who roofed it at the second attempt despite the best efforts of three defenders attempting to block its path from six yards. No longer bothering to celebrate, he converted another Kidd cross after getting in front of his man to skim a deft near-post header home for his fourth.Northampton, 5-0 down after Kidd added to United’s tally by stabbing home from a corner, decided to implement their original gameplan by nobbling Charlton, who was forced off with injury and replaced by Francis Burns. Joining his muddied colleagues, the substitute cut a decidedly incongruous figure in his pristine red and white kit as, with his first touch, he sent Best haring through the middle past two defenders before slotting his fifth and United’s sixth past the increasingly forlorn Book.An exchange of goals – Kidd’s second and a consolation for Northampton’s Dixie McNeill – preceded the pick of Best’s half-dozen. Collecting a pass from Crerand on the edge of the penalty area, he ghosted past a defender and with a little feint and left Book on his backside gazing in admiration as he ked home his sixth from a couple of yards. Exhausted, he leaned against the adjacent upright for support as the home crowd acknowledged his genius.“I remember thinking George was going to go one way but he dropped his shoulder and went the other and by then I was already on the deck,” Book recalled. “He was just too good for me.” A subsequent Frank Large header doubled Northampton’s tally.Northampton’s chairman, a local pharmacist by the name of Eric Northover, was not as magnanimous as his players or the home crowd. “It was disgraceful,” he fumed. “To lose 8-2 on your own ground is unforgivable. Six of the Best? I would call them six of the easiest.” In the immediate aftermath of a performance that would earn Best an invitation to 10 Downing Street from the prime minister, Harold Wilson, Best and Crerand adjourned to the Northampton dressing room to commiserate with their traumatised opponents. “They sat down with us and George said: ‘Don’t worry about it, mate. There wasn’t much you could do.’ He was a gentleman,” Book recalled. Floating above a Northampton bog on a February afternoon a half-century ago, there was little or nothing George Best could not do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72c8427a1b6e6e01ec778fa0c7ce997b04c2ae07/0_50_4416_2650/master/4416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0a93b1f4ee2a098721a6cbc081a835e","title":"safe standing across english football step closer sports grounds safety autority report positive","story":"Safe standing across English football has come a step closer after a report found it had “a positive impact on spectator safety”.The findings, made by the Sports Grounds Safety Authority (SGSA) in an interim report, have been welcomed by government. They could herald the return of standing to the top two isions in England for the first time since the implementation of the Taylor report, should they be borne out in the final version of the report due this summer.The SGSA has this season studied behaviour at Celtic Park and Borussia Dortmund’s Westfalenstadion as well as at English clubs Shrewsbury Town, Wycombe Wanderers and Oxford United which are trialling the technology. Their key observation in the interim report is that safe standing “has had a positive impact on spectator safety, particularly in mitigating the risk of crowd collapse.”The SGSA also observe that safe standing has not caused tension between supporters or between supporters and stewards. “There has been very little conflict as a result of standing,” it said.While the findings are still provisional, they have met with approval from the government Every political party endorsed the idea of safe standing in their manifestos during last year’s election and the sports minister Nigel Adams reinforced that view in light of the report.“I welcome the latest findings from the Sports Grounds Safety Authority’s research. As we made clear in our election manifesto, we will work with fans and clubs towards introducing safe standing at football grounds.“However it is imperative that football remains as safe as it has become over the past 25 years. Robust evidence that this change will provide equivalent or improved safety for supporters, will be absolutely paramount to this process.“There is more work that needs to be done. The SGSA is continuing to gather evidence over the course of this season, and I have asked them to work with the football authorities to consider next steps as we work with clubs and fans to introduce safe standing.”Standing in the top two flights of English football has been banned since the implementation of the Taylor report which followed the Hillsborough tragedy of 1989. Since 1994 all clubs in the Premier League and Championship have been obliged to have all-seater stadia.Standing is possible in Leagues One and Two, where traditional terracing still remains at many grounds. The trials observed by the SGSA involve one particular type of standing arrangement, rail seating, which involve seats that can be folded away to allow standing and form a barrier at each level of the ground.The EFL commented on the SGSA report stating: “The EFL is encouraged by the direction of travel being taken on what remains an important issue for the League and its membership. Our position remains consistent in that EFL Clubs, across all three isions, should be able to provide supporters with the matchday experience they want in accordance with the relevant safety requirements, whether it is sitting or standing in stadiums.”The SGSA’s research will now continue until the end of the season. Should the final report prove positive, it could pave the way to the return of safe standing by the 2021-22 season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc2b60ef66d06ac7adcebde863fc9e9c5dcc8c23/0_0_6208_3726/master/6208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=697cdbb18ff92f74761879e64d853e15","title":"watford adam masina interview","story":"Defender lost his mother as an infant, passed through several foster homes as his father struggled with alcohol, and bounced back from rejection by BolognaLast weekend’s 3-2 defeat by Everton, to a stoppage-time goal having at one stage been two up and apparently in control, was a particularly bitter experience even for a Watford side accustomed to disappointment this season. But for Adam Masina at least the cloud had a silver lining. For the first time in England he had started four successive matches shortly before kick-off he was presented with an award as the club’s player of the month, and shortly afterwards he scored his first Premier League goal.The Italian was an ever-present in Watford’s matchday squads last season but started 27 of their league games on the bench and on 24 of those occasions he ended the game there, too. He recommitted over the summer, determined to play more, but then did not see a minute of league action until October. Starts, goals and player of the month trophies seemed very distant only weeks ago.“This year started so bad because I was out of the squad every weekend and I was so sad,” he says. “I didn’t know why I was out because my level of commitment was high as always. It was so, so hard for me. When I joined I was sure that in maybe three, four months I would start to play, and it was so disappointing for me to finish the season as the second left-back. I know now, it’s the past. We look forward. One thing my grandmother taught me is that you have to look after yourself and keep fighting until the end because, if you want something, you have to take it. No one will give it to you.”Of all the battles Masina has had to face this one is comparatively trivial. His remarkable story starts in Khouribga, a town about 100km south-east of Casablanca, to which his parents returned, having moved to Italy, so his mother could give birth and raise her baby with the help and support of her family. She died when Adam was a few months old. “I don’t know what actually happened,” he says, “but I was told she got an infection and unfortunately she left us.” He, his older brother, Zakaria, and his father, Mustafa, returned to Italy but his father struggled with alcoholism and the children were taken into care. They passed through several foster homes and, when finally they found one where they felt comfortable, the couple orced and they had to leave.The boys ended up in Maranàtha, a shelter for struggling families and children in Bologna, and spent a year there before being reunited with their father. Unfortunately his troubles with alcohol were not over and after one particularly harrowing evening when he dragged his children – Adam was perhaps four or five – from bar to bar while they cried and pleaded to return to their last foster home, they were separated for the final time.The only question that Masina refuses to answer during a long and frank conversation is about his current relationship with Mustafa or if there even is one. He has another family now that last foster couple had orced but the ex-husband, Raffaele, and his own mother, Teresa, took the boys in and raised them. Eventually they were adopted and both took Raffaele’s surname.“When I think about myself, about my life, I realise that in the end I was lucky,” says Masina. “I went through something, something different from normal life, but now I’m happy. I have a baby, my girlfriend, my family. For me, I have to be honest, it was easy. It’s not the right word but I’ve realised how lucky I was.“One man took me and my brother and looked after us like sons. Now I’m a father and I’m thinking if I could adopt someone, and it’s hard. You have to work with these kids, to give them discipline, to be right with them. And my father did this with two children. It’s unbelievable, incredible. To have enough love for these two children, the children of strangers. I don’t know what term I can use, more than incredible.”Zakaria has written a book of poetry about their childhood. “No, about his childhood,” Masina corrects me. “We were together but we had a different experience. If you read his poetry, you could compare our stories. As I said before, for me it was easy, because I have got to where I wanted to be. For my brother it was tougher. As of this moment he hasn’t come out the other side. He hasn’t found serenity.”It was at Maranàtha that Masina was introduced to football, which soon became an obsession. At 11 he was spotted by Bologna and joined their academy, becoming a promising striker, but at 17 he was told he could leave.“That summer was so tough,” he recalls. “I remember as if it was yesterday. My grandmother, my father and my brother were in a little flat we had rented by the seaside and I cried for an entire month. My grandmother told me not to worry. I remember I said to her: ‘I want to be a footballer.’ And she said: ‘OK, but second option, what else do you want to do?’ And I said: ‘My second option is to be a footballer.’ For her, for me, for my father it was tough.”He ended up at Giacomense, a club in Italy’s regional fourth ision based 60km – a gruelling commute of about an hour and a half each way, by train and bus – from Masina’s home, where he was converted into a defender. At the end of his first year with them Giacomense played a friendly against Bologna’s Under-23s, a game of, literally, three halves. Masina sat out the first, played the second as striker and the third at left-back, and by the final whistle his old club wanted him back.Masina refused to go, believing that he would benefit from a season of senior football, but when they returned for him a year later there was no hesitation. Two strokes of luck followed: they were relegated to Serie B in 2014, when he was 20, and that December their left-back and captain, Archimede Morleo, was injured and Masina was thrust into the team.“In my head I was ready to go on loan, maybe to the third ision, because I wanted to play. I was going to leave in just one month,” he says. “But I got an opportunity, and I took it. That season we got promoted but fucking hell it was hard. By the end we were out of gas, running on fumes, everyone dead. We went up through the play-offs and that night was crazy. I loved it. We were driven through the city on a bus and it was crazy. What a memory. This is the story of my life: highs and lows.”He spent three years as Bologna’s first-choice left-back and played six times for Italy’s Under-21s before moving to Watford in 2018. “It was hard to leave. So hard. But the first day I came here I said: ‘OK, I like this.’ Because it was like the next level. In Bologna we had a good team but here everyone has quality, everyone is fighting, everyone is running. Everyone has a fire inside.”Now they have to show it. After a run of four wins in six unbeaten games over Christmas hauled Watford out of the relegation places, a couple of defeats have seen them slip back in. From here every game, starting at Brighton on Saturday, is potentially crucial. “We can’t be relegated with this team,” Masina says. “It’s impossible. This team has quality, strength, everything. We have everything. I know in the Premier League the level is so high but I think this team is a very good team. This season started so bad. I think with Nigel Pearson we fixed it a little bit, but we have to finish the work, because it’s not possible for us to even think about relegation.”It is going to be a struggle but not one Masina is afraid of. “I’m still fighting, every day. This is my way,” he says. “I know where I’ve come from and I know that you get nothing for free in this life. So I’ll keep fighting.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef98423632aa82fd79d4bca5e49aa98b38e46137/3_612_4030_2419/master/4030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6007cf08c8ea564d13f831d9b525d79f","title":"team news previews and big weekend in europe football countdown live","story":"And more from Pep with City winger Leroy Sane back in training after a lengthy injury.He has started to train with us.

For the last two summers, the window has closed for clubs in the top two isions on the Thursday before the start of the Premier League season. Clubs in League One and Two already have the longer window, but second-tier sides must decide at an EFL meeting at the end of the month whether to come into line with the Premier League, something they are expected to do.A statement from the EFL read: “The EFL notes the decision taken by Premier League clubs to change the closure date for its summer transfer window. EFL clubs discuss the matter on an annual basis and will do so at a meeting later this month where a determination will be made as to whether there is to be any change moving forwards.”The Copa del Rey semi-finals have been drawn and an all-Basque final is on. Athletic Bilbao v GranadaReal Sociedad v MirandésThe final will be played at the Estadio de La Cartuja in Seville, which will host the event up until 2023. And for the first time since 2010, neither Real nor Barcelona will be in the final. As we await the Copa del Rey draw, a look back to that 2008 FA Cup semi-final quartet: West Brom v Cardiff, and Portsmouth v Barnsley. Barnsley were in the Mirandés role, and had beaten Liverpool *and* Chelsea on their way there.

He wants to qualify for the Europa or Champions League, to win the FA Cup. He is 32, but still very ambitious. He is focused. He still has so many targets. The Euros are a super important goal too. It’s what I admire in Jan. He wants to play at the top level as long as possible. We haven’t reached an agreement (on a contract extension) as yet, but we don’t rule out anything. There is interest in him as a free agent, but Spurs is a very interesting option for us. The door’s still open.Real Madrid also exited the Copa on Thursday night, and also to a Basque club, meaning that the final four is Mirandés of the Segunda División, Athletic, La Real and Granada.

At least 33,000 children need urgent medical treatment due to acute malnutrition, according to Oxfam Guatemala.Central America is one of the world’s most dangerous regions outside a warzone, where a toxic mix of violence, poverty and corruption has forced millions to flee north in search of security.Now, drought, famine and the battle for dwindling natural resources are increasingly being recognized as major factors in the exodus.And it seems to be getting worse: 2019 was the driest year in a decade with only 65 days of rain, according to Guatemala’s National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology. Guatemala’s subsistence farmers depend on rainfall – which is increasingly erratic – and most lack alternative sources of water.Worsening hunger across the region is a factor in the rise in migrant caravans trying to reach the US overland, according to both analysts and migrants themselves.The caravans have been met with repression and hostility by Mexican and American authorities who accuse the migrants and refugees of political subversion and criminality.But experts warn that the additional burden of extreme weather is overwhelming these communities, which have been long ignored and repressed by the government.Marc-Andre Prost, a WFP regional nutrition adviser, told Reuters: “Climate change is not responsible for this situation but it’s definitely exacerbating a situation where people don’t have the capacity to cope.”Guatemala’s new president, Alejandro Giammattei, like numerous predecessors, has pledged to make child malnutrition a national priority, but the 2020 budget proposed a decrease of $27m to the ministry of health and a $13m increase for defense. (Congress failed to approve the budget in November, and details of the new budget have not yet been released.)For García, the situation is desperate: food aid has yet to reach her canton, so once the maize runs out in March, she must find backbreaking work picking coffee – or else risk starvation. There’s no guarantee she’ll even find work, as a leaf-eating fungus known as roya – which thrives in warm conditions – has also devastated coffee crops.García, who’s weak from chronic hunger, said: “I’ll get paid $4 a day. But if I pick less than 46kg, I won’t get paid.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddf5db28bdce864b3331fe1eb2b08cf71307f01f/0_206_4216_2530/master/4216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b517a71be88b12c9f0e361565ebadd6","title":"popularity of pug flat nosed dogs could be fuelling rise in canine fertility clinics","story":"Investigation links boom in flat-faced canines to rise in clinics, some of which advertise banned proceduresThe boom in popularity of flat-faced dogs such as pugs and French bulldogs may be fuelling a rise in canine fertility clinics, some of which advertise banned procedures, an investigation has found.Dogs with squashed faces, known as brachycephalic dogs, are often unable to breed or give birth naturally due to their extreme anatomy: the animals’ small hips can make mating difficult, meaning breeders turn to artificial insemination, while they also mean caesarean sections are often necessary since the puppies have disproportionately large heads.The dogs’ breathing difficulties – a result of their ultra-short snout – can also make it difficult for them to mate.Yet despite the risk of this and other problems, including skin and eye conditions, the clamour for such dogs has been huge. According to data from the Kennel Club, registrations of French bulldogs alone has risen from 1,521 in 2009 to 36,785 in 2018. Over the same period, the use of artificial insemination in dogs has also risen.Now an investigation by the journal Vet Record has found there are currently at least 37 canine fertility clinics in the UK – as discovered through internet searching. In 2015, a BBC report on a clinic suggested the existence of such a facility was noteworthy and unusual. That, they say, suggests there has been a rise in such clinics.“There has been rising public demand for these dogs, and these breeds tend to need human assistance in order to be able to breed,” he said.The report reveals that 20 of the clinics offered flat-faced dogs as studs, while examination of the websites by the  found many illustrated with images of such breeds. Indeed, some clinics appear to be entirely devoted to brachycephalic dogs. Services on offer range from artificial insemination to ultrasound scans, sperm motility testing, microchipping, progesterone testing and, in some cases, caesarean sections.Loeb and colleagues found some of these clinics are linked to veterinary surgeries, while others are run through basic websites with limited contact details.The researchers say the findings raise several concerns. Some procedures can only be carried out by a vet, including caesarean sections and artificial insemination involving transfer of sperm to the female’s cervix. Loeb and colleagues note that while it is possible clinics without a vet may hire one for such procedures, it is not clear whether they do so.What’s more, the team found two clinics advertising an invasive form of artificial insemination that was banned in the UK last year. Upon contacting the clinics, they were told the website information was incorrect and would be removed.Loeb said the findings raise questions, including whether anyone is monitoring what happens in such clinics.“Unlike businesses that breed and sell dogs, those offering stud dogs, canine artificial insemination and ultrasound scans do not require a licence to operate,” the report notes. “They are not generally regulated unless they offer services that are clearly acts of veterinary surgery.”In a linked editorial, Loeb writes that breeding flat-faced dogs using artificial insemination and caesareans may even be unlawful, pointing to regulations that say dogs should not be kept for breeding if their genes or other traits suggest breeding would harm the health or welfare of the parent or offspring. “There are lots of procedures that can be done to animals that are banned, because they are seen as mutilations because they are purely for aesthetic purposes,” Loeb told the . “If you think about it, this is another example of that.”But Bill Lambert, head of health and welfare at the Kennel Club, said artificial insemination is now used for many breeds and can bring genetic benefits, while non-vets can be very skilled in aspects of canine fertility that can be practised without veterinary qualifications. Professional support, he added, can help inexperienced breeders ensure safety and good conditions.“Where veterinary procedures are not involved then sometimes you can get extremely experienced people who are not vets but they are maybe more experienced in certain areas,” he said. Daniella Dos Santos, president of the British Veterinary Association, said the organisation was deeply concerned about the advertising of banned procedures, adding that while other forms of artificial insemination are allowed and important for breeding, a vet should be involved in their use.That said, she stressed, the process is not suitable for all dogs – including those who cannot mate or give birth naturally.“We would be concerned about artificial insemination being used in such cases, or to allow dogs with inherited diseases and conditions, for example brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome in flat-faced dogs, to be used for breeding,” she said. “Vets will often recommend that these dogs are neutered.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23bed199ce0c6332c62821e77cb77ee9787a3b46/19_0_1617_970/master/1617.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c26792cae8871d656c116b890a31306","title":"romesh ranganathan sri lankan food finally cool dont tell my mum","story":"She’s the Thierry Henry of Sri Lankan cooking – a hipster hopper can’t competeThe other night I went to a Sri Lankan restaurant in London (Paradise – not my review, the name). I have eaten more than my fair share of Sri Lankan food, growing up with a mum who is not only the Thierry Henry of Sri Lankan cooking, but also sees a fat son as the best way of marketing her brand.Sri Lankan food is nothing like Indian: it is hotter, drier, has a different array of flavours, and distinct staples, like hoppers (a bowl-shaped crispy pancake made from fermented rice flour) and coconut sambol (coconut made physically addictive). It hasn’t been taken to the heart of British culture in the same way Indian food has. Many people seem not to realise that they are different cuisines. One of my first standup routines was about the frustrations of going to an Indian restaurant with white friends and being asked for recommendations about a cuisine I had no more understanding of than they did. (The punchline was: “Why don’t you tell me what you know about tortellini, you prick” – sophisticated stuff.)I have also eaten at a lot of Sri Lankan restaurants, mainly with my parents. But these have been aimed at Sri Lankans. They are filled with tables that look as if they were stolen from a garden centre, and the vibe is very “school canteen”. You go in, order food from a guy who makes you feel as if you have insulted his family, then a while later you are delivered the most beautifully authentic Sri Lankan cuisine for a measly price. I love these places.At Paradise, however, I was faced with a new experience. The dishes were all things I have eaten by the bucketload throughout my life, albeit with a contemporary twist, and I felt proud to see them being enjoyed by almost exclusively non-Sri Lankans in a very trendy-looking venue.It wasn’t all pie-eyed euphoria, though. I have to confess I find the trend of walk-in-only restaurants extremely hostile to the greedier diner. When I eat out, I like to know what time we are going to be sitting down so I can push my hunger to its limit. I can only do this with close friends and family, because me eating when very hungry is one of the great visual atrocities of the modern age.If I am with people outside the inner circle, I normally eat before I get there. That way, I am less grabby when the food arrives, and people leave thinking I’m a polite, elegant diner, while in reality I am a greedy bastard who is tucking into his second dinner. When I get to a restaurant and they tell me a table will be ready in 40 minutes, it’s as much as I can do not to lock the door, declare the other diners hostage, and make my first demand the immediate delivery of an aubergine curry. In fairness to Paradise, they said it would be a 20-minute wait, but by then I’d already loaded my gun.I had to tell my mum about my discovery. I thought she might be excited about the prospect of top-quality Sri Lankan scran being served to the trendies of Soho. Later that day, she popped round to say that she had looked at the menu, and it didn’t look that great. She also warned me that aubergine curry can be quite unhealthy, because of the frying, oblivious to the fact that she makes tankers of it for me. I realised then that I had made a fundamental error. I promised to take her soon, and this time I will remember to tell her that, while the food is nice, it’s not anywhere near as good as she makes it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a90e807f9da73d4c8fff3408ce758e4a7c379634/438_780_4834_2901/master/4834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c54e86517ceea43f4705d718c4b1a168","title":"springs loaded test driving nikes new vaporfly running shoe","story":"Would the brand’s claim to make plodders into joggers stand up at the Burgess Park parkrun?“If you hear the sound barrier being broken over Burgess Park,” I said to my flatmate as I left the house, “that will be me.”I was joking, sort of. Ahead of me, the 5km local parkrun. Beneath me, or at least on my feet, a new pair of Nike Vaporflys – the most talked-about trainers in the world.So much spring has been put into so many steps by these shoes, it has been branded “technological doping” by some in the world of athletics.Looking at the science before heading out, it seemed that these trainers were higher-tech than the Toyota Starlet in which I learned to drive – and quite possibly faster.Even the design, in a very precisely calibrated turquoise and tangerine, makes it look as though your feet are sliding outwards off your legs.Elite runners don’t need convincing. Of the 36 possible podium finishes in world marathon majors in 2017, 19 were wearing Vaporflys.But none of those medallist marathoners are likely to have pounded the paths of Burgess parkrun in Southwark, south LondonSo, could the Nike lab magic work on me?The US runner Jacob Riley had it exactly right when he said Vaporflys felt “like trampolines” my old Adidas trainers felt like spa slippers by comparison.That always happens with new running shoes: like getting fitted for a bra, you wonder how you ever managed to muddle on with the old ones for so long. But it was immediately obvious that the Vaporflys were different.It was as if springs were shooting out from under my feet, bouncing me along Inspector Gadget-style. They felt simultaneously weightless and like mattresses had been lashed to my soles.I typically complete the 5km course in 28 minutes, give or take 30 seconds. But since the new year the Burgess parkrun has attracted record-breaking numbers, with more than 800 runners jostling to get around.Bottlenecks at the start and finish had slowed me down and there was little my trainers could do about that. So my expectations were low. When my results came, I was flabbergasted: 26 minutes, 18 seconds – one second off an entire minute faster than my fastest-ever.My previous personal bests had all been hard-won in incremental, 30-second improvements. This was a monumental advance.The Vaporflys undeniably work. I am not sure why I thought they wouldn’t. And therein lies the problem: I couldn’t feel proud of my achievement. If a personal best is simply a matter of money, does it really count?For the average parkrunner, motivated less by speed than reducing the risk of early death, £250 for a pair of trainers is a lot of money – even if you shave a minute off your personal best.And these are not shoes for your average daily jog-about – Nike markets them as “for race days”, a nod to their relatively limited mileage.But with a half-marathon looming, it is reassuring to know that I have time, and tech, on my side – whether deserved or not.As of last week, I’m with the person who replied: “You sound slow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdf424360981f394841f2702d23a4ec8b0836315/0_298_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af40eeaad20917c16f4e8959d4628af8","title":"green day rocknroll helps you dance through the apocalypse","story":"Can the world’s biggest punk band capture the zeitgeist on their new album like American Idiot once did? They talk about staying positive in the age of Trump – and how people have forgotten to love each other• Why Green Day and 90s punk still resonates with today’s young music fansGreen Day are in their modest rehearsal space in their hometown of Oakland, California, a little haven in a country on the turn. The trio of 47-year-olds – still the world’s biggest punk band – are posing for photos with singer-guitarist-songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong’s prized Triumph motorcycle. Then someone remembers that the band’s forthcoming Hella Mega Tour, alongside fellow alt-rock survivors Fall Out Boy and Weezer, is sponsored by Harley-Davidson. The Triumph is put back under its protective sheet.“Welcome to Trump’s America,” sighs bassist Mike Dirnt when I tell him of my journey via San Francisco, where I was shocked to see so much desperate homelessness. “A place where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Sadly, I don’t think we’ve seen anything yet.” The band own a number of Oakland businesses – “it’s important for us to do what we can to lift up our local area,” Dirnt says – while Armstrong still goes on protests and attends local punk shows.Armstrong is a fan of new bands such as ShitKid, the Chats and White Reaper, though is often confused by what he sees. “I’ll see kids wearing leather jackets and a Grateful Dead T-shirt. How did that happen?” Recently, he attended a show only to be confronted by a young punk with giant liberty-spiked hair, “looking like he’d just walked out of a squat”, asking for a selfie on a brand-new iPhone. “It’s cool and it’s weird,” he laughs. “I’m just excited people are still doing cool shit.”Green Day’s new album is titled Father of All Motherfuckers and yet, surprisingly for a band best known for delivering 2004’s George Bush-baiting rock opera American Idiot, they say Donald Trump had little influence on the new record. At the same time, they insist it is political.“It’s all there in the songs,” Armstrong says. “I’m singing about ‘looking out for the jingoes and heathens’ or ‘another black kid shot in town’.” There’s a lyric about bulletproof backpacks designed as protection during school shootings, “one of the most absurd ideas I’ve ever heard”. But Armstrong doesn’t want to be on the nose. “Everything that is happening in the world is right there on Twitter. It’s so confusing and it’s so depressing. I really wanted to create some kind of escape for people I didn’t want to be so obvious.” Satirical punk site The Hard Times wrote a story the day of Trump’s inauguration titled Future Green Day Concept Album Sworn Into Office. “It was funny, but I didn’t want us to do that. It wasn’t where our heads were at – at all.” Where were your heads at? “I was listening to Little Richard.”“And the world has become so isive,” says drummer and band goof Tré Cool. “We wanted to try to bring people together. It’s become something of a far-out concept to love each other!”This year the band will turn 34. No punk band has made it this far. The Sex Pistols lasted three years, the Clash 10, the Ramones 22. Green Day are writing the blueprint while living it, so it is no surprise that they have sometimes made mistakes. Last year Armstrong duetted with Morrissey on his covers album California Son – a terrible look in the wake of Morrissey’s vocal support for far-right organisations and iniduals.“I wasn’t aware until the song came out,” says Armstrong. “We do the song, and he was very lovely, and then the song comes out and a lot of Brits were like: what the hell are you doing? I really did not have a clue … ” Bewitched by the singer’s status as an 80s indie godhead, he simply failed in his due diligence. Cool pipes up, giggling: “Hey, we’ve all got our Ted Nugents, right?” – a reference to the US rocker and gun enthusiast.Green Day have endured major wobbles and are now in “uncharted territory,” as Armstrong puts it. “People get over their high school bands. They don’t go on to spend every day in their orbit for the next 20 years.”After two records on the late, great East Bay punk imprint Lookout!, in 1994 the young band signed with major label Reprise. The punk scene was aghast. 924 Gilman Street, the puritanical Berkeley-based all-ages headquarters of said scene banned the group from performing. Green Day released Dookie in February of that year and it sold 20m copies. They wouldn’t return to play Gilman Street until 2015.Old friends and fellow scenesters might not have wanted to talk to them any more, but everyone else did. Along with Smash, the third album by fellow Californians the Offspring (at 11m sales, the biggest-selling record on an independent label ever) and the rise to prominence of the Berkeley band Rancid, Dookie spearheaded an interest in American punk rock not seen since the birth of the New York CBGB scene 20 years earlier – but with the sales to match the cultural impact.“We were always thinking about legacy,” Cool says. “We never wanted songs to sound like we’d relied too much on whatever recording techniques were in vogue. We knew we were in this for the long haul.”Then came, if not decline, then some cooling off. The excellent Insomniac arrived in 1995 and struggled on account of not being Dookie. Nimrod followed in 1997 another strong collection of songs that became most notable for featuring a coda, the purely acoustic Good Riddance (Time of Your Life), that suggested there might be more to Armstrong’s songwriting than three chords and fuzz. The song soundtracked the Seinfeld finale and became a hit at US high school proms, its melancholy dovetailing with events that marked a passing of time. And yet by 2000’s Warning, the mall had been relinquished to the nu-metal kids. Warning became the first release of Green Day’s major-label career not to go multi-platinum. They wouldn’t release an album for another four years.“I find it hard between records thinking what I’m going to write about,” Armstrong says. “I get a lot of self-doubt. I don’t think I’ve ever realistically thought the band might be done, but I have questioned whether I could do it any more.”Green Day re-emerged amid war in the Middle East under Bush. Young people who might once have been fans were returning in body bags. “Sieg heil to the President Gasman,” Armstrong sang on Holiday from the album American Idiot, and if punks weren’t supposed to sign to major labels, they certainly weren’t supposed to release double albums that became Broadway musicals.It sent them stratospheric and the weight of expectation since has never truly lifted: 2009’s 21st Century Breakdown felt ordinary in the shadow of its predecessor the release of three albums in a year – 2012’s ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! and ¡Tré! – favoured quantity over quality. An ill-fated festival appearance saw Armstrong, his set about to be cut short, destroy his guitar and rant: “I’m not Justin Bieber!” He subsequently went into rehab for the abuse of alcohol and prescription pills.The band slunk into another period of near-irrelevance. They had emerged from the previous one with a genre-defying, generation-defining reboot – this time all they had was a good record, 2016’s Revolution Radio. Few bands harness the zeitgeist once, let alone twice. Is Father of All Motherfuckers that third moment? No, but it is the closest they have come since American Idiot. At 26min 16sec, it is their shortest album, featuring a collection of songs as fast and furious as any in their discography. It sounds as if they are having fun for the first time in years, without trying too hard.Armstrong says it is an “homage to the roots of rock’n’roll music, the music that inspired us to do this. That doesn’t just mean punk rock. It’s Martha and the Vandellas and Mott the Hoople. Old bubblegum music like the Archies. Powerpop. Garage music … Playing Motown through Green Day, so to speak.”You might read the fizzing Father of All Motherfuckers as Green Day saying they are not done yet. Ask them if their forthcoming triple-header tour is an attempt to halt a downturn in the band’s fortunes and Armstrong will laugh and say, in reference to 80s-themed package tours: “There are many differences between Green Day and Kajagoogoo … We’re going to keep making records that matter. I always want whatever we do to feel like the first time we played at Gilman, or the first time we made a rock opera.” By embracing the band’s love of rock’n’roll, Green Day are also trying to reclaim something at their nation’s core. Instead of an overt appearance from Trump in the lyrics, there is positivity and make-do spirit it feels like a record about a beloved US, not the US that presently exists. “I think good rock’n’roll has always had this ability to be transcendent,” says Dirnt. “A song might be about losing your gal or whatever other misfortune has come your way … but the best stuff takes your hand and helps you dance through the apocalypse. I’d like to think that’s what we’re trying to do.”Rock as an act of resistance, I offer. “Oh yeah,” they all chime. “I like that!”Father of All Motherfuckers is out on Reprise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc6719a15dd81b45514b042cf6b69a1847577663/0_178_3221_1932/master/3221.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da4dd7ccd3e31c869282538c220cf767","title":"karen pierce appointed first female british ambassador us washington","story":"UK’s permanent representative to UN takes up most prominent post in diplomatic serviceDame Karen Pierce, the UK’s permanent representative to the UN, has been appointed Britain’s ambassador to Washington, becoming the first woman to hold the position – the most prominent in the diplomatic service.Pierce, a career diplomat who joined the Foreign Office in 1981, faces an arduous task to restore frayed relations with Donald Trump’s administration after the previous ambassador, Kim Darroch, felt forced to resign over leaked cables that revealed he made uncomplimentary personal remarks about the US president.Tensions between London and Washington worsened after the British government’s decision to give the Chinese telecoms corporation Huawei partial access to the UK’s 5G network. The decision was taken in defiance of pressure from the White House and reportedly led to a difficult phone call between Trump and Boris Johnson days later. The US president was “apoplectic”, according to a report in the Financial Times, despite Foreign Office officials believing they had squared the decision with the US intelligence community before making the announcement.Since joining the Foreign Office, Pierce has been posted to Tokyo, the Balkans and Geneva. She served as the UK’s ambassador to Afghanistan in 2015 and 2016. She became political director at the Foreign Office, a leading domestic diplomatic position, before heading to the UN. There she has regularly crossed swords with Russia over its conduct in the Syrian civil war, arguing its support for Bashar al-Assad’s regime has weakened Vladimir Putin’s moral authority.Pierce has a blunt speaking style when necessary and fought back strongly against suggestions that British influence at the UN was on the wane because of Brexit. Pierce said she was “honoured” to have been asked to take up the post. “I think it is the UK’s single most important relationship. There is a deep bond between Britain and the US, built on many pillars,” she said.“We have a fantastic cross-government team across the US and I look forward to working with them to strengthen and even further deepen the special relationship between our two countries and peoples.”Dominic Raab, the British foreign secretary, added: “At a time of huge opportunity for the friendship between the UK and US I am delighted that Karen Pierce will take forward this exciting new chapter in our relationship. We’re proud to be sending to Washington such an outstanding diplomat, and I warmly congratulate her on her appointment.”Although Trump admires Johnson personally, and has welcomed Brexit, a raft of issues – including climate change, the Iran nuclear deal and a UK digital tax – could sour relations and make US-UK trade talks, due to be negotiated this year, more difficult.The UK in turn feels wounded that it was not consulted prior to major moves by Washington in the Middle East, such as the US troop withdrawal from Syria or the attack that killed the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani.Johnson decided to shelve an early visit to Washington to concentrate on domestic issues. The prime minister has good relations with the Trump family, including the president’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.In a presidential election year, Pierce will also need to maintain links with senior Democrats, even if the odds move towards the prospect of a second Trump term.Her successor at the UN will have to fend off calls for the UK to give up its seat on the security council, which is seen by African and South American states as a post-second world war anachronism.Pierce, whose husband works in the Treasury, grew up in Preston in Lancashire, “reading boys’ books and drawing fighter jets in art class”. Her northern accent was stripped away at a young age by elocution lessons, partly to help with a childhood stammer. She has an ability to switch from a frank informality to full diplomatic sobriety in the space of a minute.In a recent  profile Pierce identified the decisive moment in her early life as “sitting at the breakfast table aged about 11 and staring at a photograph of an African-American diplomat boarding a battleship in some sunny, foreign place.” That woman was almost certainly Eleanor Hicks, one of the very few African-American women who served in senior roles abroad for the US state department in the early 70s. Hicks was the US consul in Nice, and to Monaco. Her style, singing ability and fashion sense meant she was regularly profiled in colour magazines around the world.“I definitely remember being attracted by the blue of the sky, the white of her suit and her black skin, the grey and the whites of the sailors,” Pierce says. “It was a stunning photograph. I didn’t understand where it was, but it wasn’t Preston.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a90f0d6b2a794e1eea98dc37a64445fb4929f0/32_341_2844_1706/master/2844.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ee66fde152dd70d5b89ea108a102d26","title":"mary lou mcdonald sinn fein leader kingmaker ireland election ireland","story":"The 50-year-old is leading a remarkable turnaround that has wrongfooted Ireland’s two-party establishmentDuring a lifetime of hearing it played and cited too many times, Mary Lou McDonald has come to loathe the Ricky Nelson song Hello Mary Lou and its cheery declaration of love for the girl who flashes “big brown eyes”.Hello, Mary Lou,Goodbye heart.Sweet Mary Lou,I’m so in love with youThe Sinn Féin leader had better brace herself, because after Ireland’s general election on Saturday, the media and her party colleagues may well barrack her with the lyrics, channelling them into headlines and belting them out at rallies.Commentators are calling it historic, a breakthrough for the republican movement that could realign Irish politics after a century of domination by two centrist parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.The IRA slogan “tiocfaidh ár lá” means “our day will come”, but not even Sinn Féin – the terrorism group’s political wing during the Troubles – anticipated the surge. It has captured a mood for change and wrongfooted Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach and Fine Gael leader, and Micheál Martin, the leader of Fianna Fáil.At the core stands McDonald, 50, the personable Dubliner who succeeded Gerry Adams and may turn Sinn Féin into a party of government. As one wag put it in a letter to the : “Have Leo and Micheál met their Mary Lou?”In Cabra, a working-class area of McDonald’s Dublin Central constituency, many root for her to shake up what they consider an an ossified party duopoly past its expiry date.“She’s better than any of the men,” said Ann Smith, 75, a grandmother out walking her dog. “She really fights. I love the way she talks to people, especially the men. She’s well able for them.”For a movement that dates from the 1916 Easter Rising it is quite an arc: a succession of leaders with a whiff of sulphur culminating in a mother-of-two who studied English literature at Trinity College Dublin.“She’s very bright, articulate, self-confident and a good debater,” said Deaglán de Bréadún, the author of Power Play: The Rise of Modern Sinn Féin. “I’d say Sinn Féin couldn’t believe their luck when she joined. She’s such a good performer on radio and TV and it’s probably a help with southern voters that she doesn’t have a northern accent. All in all, it’s very hard for her political opponents to pick holes in her image.”Talk of seismic breakthrough may be overdone. McDonald is not about to become taoiseach. Sinn Féin’s results traditionally underperform opinion polls. The party fielded just 42 candidates for the 160-seat Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Irish parliament, so will not fully translate support into seats.Analysts expect Fianna Fáil to win about 50 to 55 seats, Fine Gael perhaps 35, and Sinn Féin 26 or at most 30. The two establishment parties have ruled out forming a coalition government with Sinn Féin, but it may yet play kingmaker.“It’s not revolution, it’s evolution,” said Dr Theresa Reidy, a political scientist and election expert at University College Cork. “For Sinn Fein it’s more about consolidation.”Even so, McDonald finds herself leading a remarkable turnaround. A party Irish voters used to shun as radioactive, an off-putting mix of Northern Ireland accents and Troubles vibes, has overtaken leftwing rivals and established itself as a voice for those who view Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael as the TweedledumTweedledee stasis.McDonald grew up in Rathgar, a middle-class suburb of Dublin, and attended a Catholic school, Notre Dame des Missions, before studying Sylvia Plath and metaphysical poets at Trinity, formerly a Protestant bastion.She worked as a researcher at the Institute of International and European Affairs, a thinktank, before joining Fianna Fáil, the party of her parents, before switching to Sinn Féin in 1999, a year after the Good Friday agreement.One version says she left because a Fianna Fáil bigwig stymied her advancement. McDonald’s version is she wanted a better fit for her principles about social justice and Irish unity.“She’s not lacking in political ambition but has fully converted to Sinn Féin ideology. You don’t thrive in that party without buying into its Irish republican mindset,” said De Bréadún.The party fast-tracked McDonald up the ranks: an MEP in 2004, a TD (MP) in 2011, then succeeding Adams as party leader in 2018. She praised him as her “political mentor” and ended a speech with “tiocfaidh ár lá”.McDonald can be “wooly” on detail but speaks with a passion that distinguishes Sinn Féin from other parties, said Reidy, the professor.Voters at first seemed unmoved. They abandoned Sinn Féin in a 2018 presidential election and in 2019 council and European parliamentary elections. The party braced for more losses in the general election, so fielded few candidates. Then the poll numbers started rising – and rising.The economy hums at near full-employment but voters are fatigued with the Fine Gael-led government, which was propped up by Fianna Fáil, and angry at hospital bed shortages and soaring rents. McDonald, ably supported by party colleagues Pearse Doherty and Eoin Ó Broin, has cast Sinn Féin as a vehicle for change.The party keenest on unification paradoxically benefitted from voter indifference towards Northern Ireland. Barely a blip in the campaign, it let Sinn Féin focus on bread-and-butter issues.That changed this week when a notorious 2007 murder returned to haunt the party, forcing McDonald to revisit Sinn Féin’s links with the IRA since the Troubles.Some voters recoiled. “Too many unanswered questions,” said Michelle Walsh, 51, a Dublin Central constituent who does not plan to vote for McDonald.Claire Beatty, 45, another constituent, said history had “leaked” out but that McDonald’s party still represented change. “The past has stuck with them but people are being left with no alternative.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/502c90396bcee4d31f25b3cec960b99e6705fc95/0_0_6948_4169/master/6948.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7905643344312dab4c8260ebafd7c989","title":"back to the future why are we opting for nostalgic pop culture","story":"From rewatching 1990s TV shows to replaying classic computer games, taking the safe option when it comes to entertainment can help audiences rediscover themselvesNever before has civilisation produced so much new pop culture. From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

The site in Armenia was constructed in 1943 to conduct top-secret research into atomic reactions for the development of nuclear weapons. Now the facility provides insight into thunderstorms and cosmic rays. The only way visitors can reach the base in winter is via a nine-mile (15km) climb through snow.Arshak Mkrtchyan, a mountain guide, cuts a trail to the station in snowshoes in temperatures around -22C.Arriving at the station at sunset, the wind is howling across the plateau and the temperature has plummeted to dangerous levels.Technicians at the facility work one month on, one month off during the winter.Inside the station, it is surprisingly cosy. Edik Arshakian and Gurgen Jabaryan, both technicians, are tasked with monitoring the scientific equipment, while Gohar Hovhannisian prepares the meals. She describes being somewhat trapped during the winter.Hovhannisian presides over an enormous kitchen built during the Soviet period, when scores of technicians were required to monitor and maintain rudimentary equipment. In winter she cooks mostly for just two technicians and herself.The confusingly named “rays” are, in fact, high-energy protons and atomic nuclei that zip through space at nearly the speed of light.When they meet the Earth’s atmosphere they strike atoms and scatter them like snooker balls. These particles have the power to cut through material, including humans, and are sometimes blamed for corrupting digital memory and crashing computers.The particles are one of the main obstacles to interplanetary travel, and their effects on astronauts and pilots are the subject of continued study.High-altitude bases such as the one on Aragats are exposed to far higher doses of the cosmic specks than occurs at sea level, since the Earth’s atmosphere serves as a protective blanket.The Aragats facility is part of a network of sites around the world studying cosmic rays and is linked to research stations as far away as Costa Rica and Indonesia.As well as studying cosmic rays, the centre is equipped with sensors that can record lightning strikes from miles around. In 2018, researchers using the sensors on Aragats found a link between thunderclouds and drastic spikes in radiation, which may affect passengers and crew onboard aircraft.Soviet-era electronics abound at the base. Amid the economic turmoil that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Aragats station was kept alive by state funds and donations from the Armenian diaspora community which continue today.Dotted around the centre, “scintillators” record incoming cosmic rays as they strike chunks of clear plastic inside, causing tiny flashes of light.Although Aragats is a thriving research site in summer, when visitors can arrive by car, through the long winter months it is a lonely place almost cut off from the rest of the world.Jabaryan jokes that his favourite part of working at the site is “when the snowmobile comes to pick me up at the end of the month”. But the isolation of this mountain station is a worthy sacrifice for science since, as Hovhannisian says: “We’re above civilisation. The cosmic particles arrive clear and pure here since there’s nothing to disturb them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youThe death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China has reached 563, as health experts prepared to meet in Geneva next week in an attempt to develop a vaccine and Japan reported 10 more infections among passengers aboard a luxury cruise liner quarantined outside Yokohama.China’s national health commission said that, as of midnight Wednesday, there were 28,018 confirmed cases throughout the country – a rise of 3,694 and the biggest 24-hour rise – as well as 24,702 suspected cases.Outside mainland China, at least 230 cases have been confirmed, including two fatalities, one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines.If you’ve been affected and would like to share your experience or news tips, anonymously if you prefer, direct with our journalists then please do so via the form below.

The contract, due to commence in the spring, amounts to a recognition that the British Horseracing Authority has some expertise in this area and headcount at its High Holborn office is to increase to fulfil its new obligations.Niall Cronin, communications manager at the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, explained: “The IHRB issued a tender for an external company to provide additional monitoring of betting trends on Irish racing to support our existing integrity functions and provide additional information to our stewards with regard to any issues or concerns that may arise.“Following the procurement process, the BHA were identified as the preferred supplier. The BHA will be supporting the IHRB in monitoring of betting on Irish racing and we will also be co-operating in other areas of intelligence.”The BHA has no history of taking on such contract work for other regulators but its spokesman, Robin Mounsey, said that the benefits of closer co-operation with Irish officials were too good to pass up. “The improved collaboration that this agreement will bring will benefit those who work in, bet on and follow racing on both sides of the Irish Sea,” he said.“Using a single intelligence management and monitoring system, as well as recruiting a dedicated resource to monitor the majority of Irish racing from a betting perspective will further protect the integrity of both British and Irish racing and allow the relationship that exists between the BHA and IHRB to grow closer still.”While the degree of proposed collaboration is new, the two regulators have had a good working relationship for years. IHRB vets have assisted the BHA in the build-up to major racing festivals by carrying out tests on some intended runners based in Ireland. Dr Lynn Hillyer, head of anti-doping and chief veterinary officer at the IHRB, joined straight from a nine-year stretch at the BHA. CCNicky Henderson made it plain at Huntingdon yesterday that Shishkin is the leader of the pack among two-mile novice hurdlers at his yard, but he also pointed out that “there’s a host of them in the Ballymore” and Global Society (1.50), who makes his second start over hurdles at Kempton Park this afternoon, could yet prove to be good enough to line up at the Festival.Global Society started favourite for three bumpers in Ireland in his first season, when he was trained by Gordon Elliott, but got off the mark immediately after switching to the Henderson stable under a hand ride by Nico de Boinville. Today’s step up to two miles and five furlongs looks sure to suit, and should also provide a much better test of his Cheltenham credentials with Colin Tizzard’s useful Ofalltheginjoints among the horses taking him on.A big field lines up for the handicap hurdle at 2.55 on the same card, but quite a few are making up the numbers and the favourite Imperial Elysian (2.55) looking fairly priced at around 4-1 to follow up his recent win at Huntingdon.Nefyn Point (3.50) should go well at around 6-1 on the Bangor card, while Fantastic Flyer (7.15) is worth an interest at decent odds to return to form at Chelmsford City this evening. Dean Ivory’s mare is generally consistent and only 2lb higher than for her latest win over course and distance. Jorvik Prince (8.15), meanwhile, will take all the beating in the finale having returned to form in convincing fashion on his first start for Mick Appleby last time.

We saw pictures of some covers coming off about quarter of an hour ago, but nothing further. News as“Hello Adam.” Hello, Austin Baird. “Talking about blimps, drones and a roof is a well-trod path on the OBO when rain intervenes. But I’m curious as to why we can’t come to terms with ‘rain stopped play’? Stuff happens. Yes we would like a day’s play but it’s ok to shrug one’s shoulders and just accept ‘rain stopped play.’It’s not the end of the world. Yours, in a state of zen.”Good take! This might be the former club player (and current freelancer) in me, but I don’t mind the occasional weather delay. It’s part of what makes cricket weird. Anyone else watching this Stokes doco on Sky? It’s really good. Ian Ward going through his two 2019 miracles, asking him what he was thinking clip by clip. “Just a reminder that they play cricket under a roof at the Marvel Stadium in Melbourne,” says Bruce in Australia. “Several times this season they have had big hitters like Chris Lynn and Phil Salt in the Big Bash whacking the ball - and no one has hit the roof. It’s definitely well worth exploring the potential at other venues.”Good point. I reckon Aaron Finch is the only player to hit the Docklands roof in an actual game? Possibly a Black Caps player too, around 2005? None of that comes close to comparing with the greatest moment at that stadium, of course. “You can’t wear number 23 at Hawthorn and not be a showman!” WHAT A DAY. John Starbuck also wants to talk blimps. “All very well, but a blimp-based cover as described would itself need very long tether lines, therefore dangerous. Also, the longer it has to function, the more likely an upset will be. Across an entire day of a Test, you’d need two more blimps ready as back-up. If used only for rain periods, the setting up and taking down actions will introduce a lag of at least one hour each, given that winds are likely too. Perhaps a giant teepee on legs, or just use the gasholder facility at the Oval instead?” I’m telling you... drones and a shadecloth!Adam Giles is with us, tapping into some well-worn OBO territory!“Rather than spend my Friday afternoon catching up on paperwork, I decided to deal with the conundrum of rain stopping play, and came to the thought of playing under a roof. Of course, with a sport like cricket, there is always an issue that the roof wouldn’t be high enough to prevent the ball hitting it, which would impact the game.”Before he goes on, if you want about 500 takes on this, I’ll point you to our OBO from the rained out India v New Zealand fixture during the World Cup. Also, there’s our Final Word daily pod from one of those sodden afternoons... after a lot of consideration, we landed on a shadecloth in space held up by drones. Back to Adam... A blimp! Yes! This is important work and our game thanks you for it. “Me again, soz.” Not at all, Peter Salmon - your thoughts are welcome here. “Re bands what came and went - ever since Barney Ronay described Matthew Wade as looking like a Tugboat Captain, I’ve had Galaxie 500 on my mind... The lyrics seem so apt to Wade too.”Just spat my water out at that perfect Barney comparison. Let’s give your song a spin as the rain gets heavier at Durban the bigger covers now on too. Oh well.The square and the pitch are covered. They look to be bringing out the run up tarps as well. So, even ifwhen this stops, we might have to wait a while. Sorry.“Morning Adam.” Afternoon, Dave Langlois. “This is certainly a good opportunity to try out a new set of bowlers, and good on em for that. But they do look a bit toothless, especially on flat slow pitches. Good news that Jimmy’s fit but the news about Jofra is bad. Someone who ambles up and generates almost all his searing pace with his arm action cannot afford to carry any elbow problems. Maybe the poor guy is going to be a false dawn.”Don’t worry, Jof is going to be just fine. He bowled 400 overs last year despite missing five of the Tests England played while he was eligible for service. Needs a good breather, which he gets now. The injury isn’t a major one, we’re told.“That’s it,” declares Mark Nicholas off-mic, but we can still hear him. “They won’t play again.” Thanks mate! Way to stay upbeat! Let’s see how this plays out.I’ll boil the kettle. Back to the inbox after that. See you there. 6.3 overs: South Africa 38-1 (Hendricks 24, Bavuma 2) Another tasty drive from Hendricks, off Woakes this time, lashing him through cover. But I’m afraid to say that’s his lot for now because rain has returned. Here come the covers. URRRRGH.6th over: South Africa 33-1 (Hendricks 20, Bavuma 1) Bavuma has one ball to look at and flicks it to midwicket to get off the mark. Until Root struck, Mark Nicholas was more interested in his clear-cut appearance, the bearded period now over: “He’s gone from being a Glastonbury regular to an accountant.” Of course, he was in the wickets in England’s win at PE just a few weeks ago. Great captaincy.Masterstroke from Morgan! He gets Root into the attack early in the innings and he gets through de Kock with one that skids on! He made room for himself to slap through cover but misread the bounce and paid the price. Fantastic captaincy to get his part-timer on, skittling the South African captain and talisman.5th over: South Africa 29-0 (de Kock 10, Hendricks 18) With the game reduced to 45 overs, the power plays are tweaked - this first period, with only two fielders permitted outside the circle, runs for nine overs not ten. Ooh, if England had a second catcher in the cordon he might have been in the game here when Woakes finds a genuine outside edge from the dangerman de Kock. That’s the second time he’s hit the seam and found considerable movement. They come back for a couple after the false stroke, the captain only back in time after a full-length e. After settling through the middle part of the over, he finds a gap at cover for two more.4th over: South Africa 25-0 (de Kock 6, Hendricks 18) Shot. Hendricks gets on the front foot and times a cover drive to perfection the slow outfield isn’t denying a boundary on this occasion, South Africa’s first for the day. He makes it two in the over, hammering Curran’s non-threatening short ball through midwicket - it makes a glorious sound off his blade. Two to finish, past point, makes 11 off it. 3rd over: South Africa 14-0 (de Kock 5, Hendricks 8) de Kock tucks one to begin, Hendricks pushing another single to cover, his captain then doing likewise. Woakes closes out the second half of the over well, sending down three tidy dots.2nd over: South Africa 11-0 (de Kock 3, Hendricks 7) Sam Curran’s first ball slips down the legside, his second is quite full at Hendricks, driven for two through cover - another shot that would have earned him four on a quicker field. He’s on a better length after that, shaping back into the right hander then angling away. Two more to finish, clipped off middle stump, but all told, a steady start from Curran.1st over: South Africa 6-0 (de Kock 3, Hendricks 3) I jumped the gun a little bit posting that they were playing as the ground staff were asked to race out to repair some turf but they’ve made it to the first ball of the day, which beats de Kock outside the off stump. Lovely delivery from Woakes. The Proteas captain is off the mark with a tuck second ball, Hendricks then also away with a couple through cover thanks to a misfield on the circle by Honest Joe Denly. Woakes is straight back on his length, finding Hendricks’ edge, through fourth slip for a further single. de Kock once more, who times a lovely push through cover but only gets two for it. “That shows how much rain we’ve had,” notes Mark Nicholas. We have lost 105 minutes so the game will be played over 45 overs. Reeze Hendricks joins his skipper, Quinton de Kock. For England, Chris Woakes has the ball in his hand. He’ll be bowling at the South African captain to begin. PLAY! A pearler from Pete Salmon! “With the addition of Bjorn Fortuin to Andile Phehlukwayo, Beuran Hendricks, Jon-jon Smuts, Lutho Sipamla and Tabraiz Shamsi, is this the best named bowling attack in the history of cricket?”Yes! Let’s lay all our love on newcomer Bjorn “BJORN AGAIN” Fortuin today.“Afternoon Adam.” Hi there, Tom Hopkins. “On the really important issue raised, we park our cars in the same garage re The Like. Are You Thinking What I’m Thinking? still gets a regular run out, but it looks as if you’re classing Release Me as their one proper album?” I guess I am. The one that cut through. I still return to their cover of Why When Love is Gone often. Hidden track on Release Me! To get through my inbox before we start. “Don’t forget,” writes Bill Bevan, “Great Britain have won the men’s World Cup Rugby League World Cup three times. Does that count?” It might, I’m afraid, have the tree falling in the woods issue?“Hello Adam.” Hi, Andy Shaw. “Why not a three-year cycle of World Cups – a T20 one, an ODI one, and a Test one? The 12-team Test tournament would be organised into two round-robin groups of six, with semi-finals and a final. The finalists would therefore play seven matches, which is easily doable within the seven-week  of the 2019 World Cup. That way everyone can play as much or as little bilateral cricket as they like, with a world championship of some sort to fight for every year.”In reality, the WTC is isn’t going to shift far from what we have at the moment. But I’m increasingly persuaded by white-ball World Cups every other year argument. Smylers on email informs me that England haven’t yet formally made the women tri-series final. Either way, it’s the perfect prep and a benefit of being Big Three. On women’s cricket too is Frank Morrish. “We hear a lot about Women’s T20 games, which is undoubtedly a good thing. I’ve always wondered, though, why don’t women play test matchesso few test matches? In my opinion it’s the superior game format - would like to see women play it too.”A long and complicated story! Summed up in a sentence: scarce funds across the women’s cricket world, so only a few countries can afford the investment. Also, a lack of red-ballmultiday action at domestic level. I can’t see it changing, sadly.And one final email on 1966 (and all that) before I politely close the book on the topic, coming in from Steven Larcombe. “When I lived in Germany, if the ball hit the bar, friends would turn to me and say, ‘ah, in England, that’s a goal, isn’t it?’”Quinton de Kock would have bowled too. The home skipper believes the wicket will be slow after the time under covers. There’s one change to the South African side, Lungi Ngidi rested in favour of Bjorn Fortuin, the left-arm tweaker. Eoin Morgan won the toss and has popped the home side in. He says the pitch looks “really good” after all the rain. They have retained the same XI as Tuesday.“In response to Phil Russell,” adds Adam Giles “Surely England’s prowess in extra timeovers stands testament to that everlasting quality of British stiff-upper-lip-esque grit, and for all those that consistently claim that Stokes isn’t truly English, his strong inclination towards such an attitude (whether with bat or ball) is clearly a large part of what has given him such a heroic status among those of us from Good Ol’ Blighty. Secondly, loving the response to the continued complaints about the manner in which the world cup is won. Clearly my father was right in his old adage that it’s far easier to win an argument when you have L. Everage, despite me misinterpreting him as requiring bargaining chips rather than the notable OBO pundit.” I’m staying out of this one! Mark Gillespie has a bit more on World Cup ‘66, though: “As we’re getting into full on pedantry, Graeme Thorn isn’t completely correct on the idea that VAR would have ruled out the German equaliser. As he’s talking about the ball “hitting the German attackers arm”, the rule change on the ball only needing to hit an arm before the assist or goal only came in this season. It’s been associated with VAR because it often gets checked in that way and came in at the same time in this country, but it’s a separate rule. So in ‘66, VAR would only have been checking for deliberate handball, which probably wouldn’t have been given.” I wonder if 1966 will still get referenced on the OBO in 2066? I do hope so!It will be reduced to a 45-over fixture. So there we have it. Positive pictures from the ground. Might we be heading towards a toss? Stand by.“So, Sir James Anderson is commentating on Sky,” notes Alistair Connor while we wait. “Nice to see he’s preparing a post-player career, but aren’t there any rules covering conflict of interest for active cricketers? Mind games?”Not that I’m aware of. I’m sure permission would need to be sought from his employer given he has a central contract, but it isn’t that novel for players to commentate before they retire. In fact, I think this came up the other week on the OBO... Colin Cowdrey the first, was it? Jimmy’s been very good on TMS. Good news for the England Women who have secured their place in the tri-series final in Australia, beating India by four wickets in Melbourne. Anya Shrubsole picked up three wickets in restricting Harmanpreet Kaur’s side to 1236. Nat Sciver struck 50 in 38 balls in the successful chase. They’re going nicely ahead of the T20 World Cup, running from 21st of this month through to the 8th of March.“Hi Adam.” Good morning, Graeme Thorn. “Re World Cup 1966 - England would have won that in normal time had VAR existed then - the ball definitely hit a German attacker’s arm before their last-minute equaliser (rendering whether Hurst’s second crossed the line moot).” Any return of serve from our German OBO readers? No? That’s settled, then!This is, as Vish says, lovely. Worth a look while it continues to rain at Durban. “Hello there.” And to you, John Starbuck. “If we decide to hold a T20I World Cup every other year (11:24 suggestion), why not every year? It should be possible to devise a meaningful T20 sequence between countries all year round, with either points or straight knockouts, to allow quarter-finals, semi-finals and final in October or November. This would have the added benefit of giving more meaning to all the current 3-match series going on already. There could be a three-series minimum to qualify. OK, now and again the finals could be in September to give GB the chance to host them, but it’s a better prospect than a Test World Championship, don’t you think?”I think it is mostly to do with concentrated tournament play. Even take the dearly departed Champions Trophy: when it was on, we are cared quite a bit. Remember too that T20 World Cups were held every other year until the current cycle and worked reasonably well given how infrequently T20Is were being played. Of course, that’s why the women have stuck with that pattern and it works well. I don’t want to bring the WTC into this necessarily but I would say that it is very fashionable to beat up on it now that we have it, however insufficientquirky in this initial iteration. Until now, the stronger complaints were that bilateral series alone - without a central organising structure - were leaving Test cricket short. For mine, there’s a good fix for the WTC when they revamp in 2023 for cycle three. In short: make every series three Tests and permit four-day fixtures to be played if it means getting to that minimum of three. This wouldn’t preclude the Big Three playing longer series or five-day Tests the Ashes won’t be diminished by having two Tests that don’t count for points. But it would make all WTC Tests equal. I’d also insist on every country playing each other. Yes, that requires a compromise between India and Pakistan, but if we were in a perfect cricketing world.“Hi Adam.” G’day, Phil Russell. “‘Fun’ fact - England are the only country to have won a men’s World Cup Final in Football, Rugby and Cricket, and every time they needed extra time to do it!” Okay, there’s an essay in this as well!

Years later, I’m still gutted The Like gave it away after one proper album. A lovely return of serve here from Lev Everage. “Can all the people still whinging about England’s World Cup win confirm that they also believe Australia didn’t win in 1999? They progressed from their tied semi with South Africa because of a superior net run rate in the preceding round, which might even be lamer than most boundaries scored.”Oh, my sweet spot! I spent two months researching the 1999 World Cup last year (an essay that lives in The Nightwatchman) and NRR, I strongly agree, is a dreadful way to sort out a tournament where points are skewed to end up level. They actually fixed this for the 2003 comp - by far the best format yet. Sigh!As a (proud) Australian living in London covering the game around the world, my assessment is that there’s no doubt that Aussie fans were far angrier about the 2019 tie-breaker than New Zealanders. There’s probably an essay in that, too.Ground inspection coming up in 15 minutes. We are seeing pictures of the outfield covers coming off the ground with the pitch now clear (very green!).

It’s a tough little period of ODI cricket for England given all their white-ball focus on the T20 World Cup in October. This is a point Andy Zaltzman made on the BBC Cricket Social when I was on there the other week: why don’t we have more World Cups?

That’s six (count ‘em) six hours from now. The ground as it looked half an hour ago. Good morning and welcome to the second ODI from Kingsmead. The bad news off the top: it is raining in Durban. With the TV coverage yet to start, I’m not sure what we are talking about exactly, but twitter is hinting at a delayed start. The forecast isn’t crash hot either, to level with you. But don’t let than dampen your enthusiasm for the OBO - we all know that our rain chats are some of the best. If they play, the task ahead of England is levelling the series after losing the opener on Tuesday. We learned more about the home side in victory than the visitors in defeat, racing away to a comfortable victory with Quinton de Kock saluting for a century at the first time of asking since taking over as skipper.It was the first limited-overs international for the world champions since they held the trophy aloft on that famous day at Lord’s last July, although the XI that played that day barely resembles the side out there this week. Plenty of those frontline white-ball stars (not least a couple of handy blokes called Stokes and Buttler) are having a breather while Archer’s elbow - we have learned since the previous fixture - requires plenty of rehab before he bowls again. Righto, I’m looking forward to your company throughout, rain or otherwise!

In Official Secrets, the dangerous information came from the state snooping centre in Cheltenham in The Haystack two junior spooks at GCHQ, nerdy Neil and laddish Zef, are charged with finding out where  writer Cora is getting her scoops about Middle East politics.The toys the boys use, chillingly giving them 24-hour access to the journalist’s flat and communications, raise the provocative topic of how far into the lives of citizens a state can pry in order to protect them. Due to the rise of “clean-skin” terrorists – those with no prior radicalism – spy chief Hannah argues that “when an attack can emerge from anywhere, we need to monitor everyone”.Another sensitive issue explored and vividly depicted – reminiscent of the great German film The Lives of Others – is that of the effects on snoopers of seeing targets more physically and psychologically naked than a lover might.Initially too video-heavy, Roxana Silbert’s staging becomes searingly theatrical in scenes that dramatise the double lives of spies by having characters simultaneously conducting conversations in different locations. John le Carré himself might admire the standout dialogue in which a spy dumps his partner during a row in which lies and truths hide behind each other.Rona Morison, superb in the Donmar’s The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, excels again as the gutsy but too trusting Cora. Oliver Johnstone and Enyi Okoronkwo, as the sneak-geeks, convey the painful moral consequences of voyeurism, even when it’s for work. Lucy Black’s high-up hack and Sarah Woodward’s top spook occasionally seem too similar in their ambitious pragmatism but a sly point may be intended about the overlaps between newspapers and the state. This pacy, brainy surveillance thriller should be widely watched.•The Haystack is at Hampstead theatre, London, until 7 March.

The station’s data goes back to 1961.Antarctica’s peninsula – the area that points towards South America – is one of the fastest warming places on earth, heating by almost 3C over the past 50 years, according to the World Meteorological Organization. Almost all the region’s glaciers are melting.The Esperanza reading breaks the record for the Antarctic continent. The record for the Antarctic region – that is, everywhere south of 60 degrees latitude – is 19.8C, taken on Signy Island in January 1982.Prof James Renwick, a climate scientist at Victoria University of Wellington, was a member of an ad-hoc World Meteorological Organization committee that has verified previous records in Antarctica.He told  Australia it was likely the committee would be reconvened to check the new Esperanza record.“The reading is impressive as it’s only five years since the previous record was set and this is almost one degree centigrade higher. It’s a sign of the warming that has been happening there that’s much faster than the global average.“To have a new record set that quickly is surprising but who knows how long that will last? Possibly not that long at all.”He said the temperature record at Esperanza was one of the longest-running on the whole continent.Renwick said higher temperatures in the region tended to coincide with strong northwesterly winds moving down mountain slopes – a feature of the weather patterns around Esperanza in recent days.He said there were complex weather patterns in the area, but the Esperanza reading was likely a combination of natural variability and background warming caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.He said: “The reason the peninsula is warming faster than other places is a combination of natural variations and warming signals.”Prof Nerilie Abram, a climate scientist at the Australian National University, has carried out research at James Ross Island at the northern tip of the peninsula.“It’s an area that’s warming very quickly,” she said, adding it can occasionally be warm enough to wear a T-shirt.Previous research from 2012 found the current rate of warming in the region was almost unprecedented over the past 2000 years.Abram said: “Even small increases in warming can lead to large increases in the energy you have for melting the ice. The consequences are the collapse of the ice shelves along the peninsula.”Meltwater can work its way through cracks in ice shelves, she said. Because ice shelves already float on the ocean, their collapse does not directly contribute to rising sea levels.But Abram said the shelves acted as plugs, helping to keep the ice sheets behind them stable. Melting of ice sheets does contribute to rising sea levels because they are attached to land.Dr Steve Rintoul, a leading oceanographer and Antarctic expert at CSIRO, said: “This is a record from only a single station, but it is in the context of what’s happening elsewhere and is more evidence that as the planet warms we get more warm records and fewer cold records.”The lowest temperature ever recorded in Antarctica – and anywhere on Earth – was at the Russian Vostok station, when temperatures dropped to -89.2C on 21 July 1983."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b772a8c28ae58b513749d8ac95241d52f81cca/0_234_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2157edfaca9a4062d729012b80315f49","title":"finland blazes trail in keeping citizens cycling and healthy","story":"Country routinely praised for its schools system aims to do the same with preventive healthby  Peter Walker in Joensuu, FinlandThe temperature, even at 9.30am, is -13C, and light snow is falling on the already white-blanketed playground. But dozens of primary-age children are out, and doing something you might not expect in such conditions: riding bikes.Teachers say about half of the children at Joensuu normal school in eastern Finland usually arrive by bicycle, even during the icy winters. Even more have done so today, as an external instructor is here to lead them around a snowy bike obstacle course and other fun challenges.The school is hosting the opening event of the Winter Cycling Congress, a small and slightly niche annual gathering held this year in Joensuu, which prides itself that many of its citizens refuse to see several months of constant snow as a barrier to getting on a bike.Juha-Pekka Vartiainen, in charge of roads infrastructure for Joensuu and among the dozens of people speaking at the three-day gathering, says the city’s year-round cycling is partly down to geography and demographics.But far more important, he stresses, is the fact that he and his predecessors have spent years building safe bike routes, separated from the motor traffic. “There’s a long tradition of cycling here. But we also have a long tradition of planning for cycling,” Vartiainen says.“The things that are important for people cycling in the summer, they become critical in winter. For example, if you don’t have a cycle route it’s almost impossible to cycle in the winter – the road gets really rutted with snow and ice. It’s dangerous.”The Winter Cycling Congress, where academics, activists and other experts present research and swap tips, is run by a tiny group of volunteers, who rely on host cities to fund and promote the annual gatherings.Joensuu and the Finnish government have embraced this role with more gusto than most, flying foreign media including the  to attend the congress.In part this is straightforward PR for the city and its wider region, North Karelia, which despite recent progress remains poorer than average for Finland and heavily dependent on industries like forestry.But there is another reason. Finland’s schools system, routinely praised as one of the best in the world, is already a magnet for visiting international researchers and envious politicians. But now the country hopes to do the same with another sector: preventive health.Amid rising global worries about increasingly inactive and overweight populations, Finland has launched a series of typically interventionist programmes to get its people moving, whether on bikes or by other means.A now-national government scheme called Finnish Schools on the Move – also represented at the congress – finds ways for more children to walk or cycle to school, and then keeps them active in the classroom, using movement in lessons or giving pupils standing desks or balls to sit on rather than chairs.Such preventive health is a key priority of the new Finnish government led by Sanna Marin, the 34-year-old prime minister, who took over in December as the head of a five-party coalition.• While some cities, like Helsinki, clears bike lanes with brushes, Joensuu uses ploughs which leave a compacted snow base, roughened by a blade to give more grip. This sort of snow is fairly straightforward to ride on.• The difficulty – seen Joensuu with unseasonably mild weather earlier this winter – comes when snow starts to melt, but then freezes to ice overnight. The only really safe way to cycle on this is to fit bike tyres with metal studs, which can grip on ice.• For more temperate winter cycling, like in much of the UK, a key tip is to not dress too warmly, as you will heat up as you cycle. But do make sure your hands, feet and ears are properly insulated.Krista Kiuru, the minister for family affairs and social services, part of the health department, is responsible for this. A former education minister, she says Finland’s public health expertise can become as great an international calling card as its schools.“We’re not rich in natural resources,” she told the  at the Finnish parliament in Helsinki. “There’s no oil. But what we can do is similar to what we have done with schools, which is a very well known product around the world.”“When we talk about health issues we talk about healthcare. But very often we’re just talking about taking care of people who are sick. So we should aim to take care of health, not just of sickness. And this is challenging, because the people involved don’t just work at hospitals, but also in in transport, at swimming pools, all of that.”Finland is a pioneer of such policies, and Kiuru says there is a consensus between parties, even the populist True Finns, the second-biggest party in parliament, that these are worth the cost.She recalls, as education minister, changing the mind of one MP who questioned the annual €500m (£425) spend on free and nutritious lunches for all children by taking him to a school to try one himself.“Finns are basically quite motivated taxpayers,” she says. “As long as they can see that there is a greater good which will come from it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/743ba96fb299f76528762bb70279ca84acb0ff6c/0_0_1003_602/master/1003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25d1e122248fce3ef97d9dfee9d2304f","title":"israeli airstrikes in syria force russian plane into emergency landing","story":"Civilian aircraft carrying 172 passengers erted from Damascus airport to Russian airbaseA Syrian passenger plane was forced to make an emergency landing at a Russian-controlled airbase in Syria during Israeli airstrikes on Damascus earlier this week, the Russian defence ministry said.An Airbus A-320 carrying 172 passengers from Tehran was erted from Damascus airport in the early hours of Thursday to nearby Khmeimim airbase after Syrian air defences nearly hit it during an attempt to repulse the alleged Israeli attack, according to Russian state news agency RIA.Initial reports in Russian media indicated the plane was Russian, but Flight Radar data showed the plane was a Syrian-operated Cham Wings flight.The incident in Syria’s skies took place a month after a Ukraine International Airlines passenger plane crashed shortly after take-off from Tehran, killing all 176 people on board, after it was shot at in error by Iranian forces.At 2am on Thursday four Israeli F-16 fighter jets struck eight air-to-ground missiles in the suburbs of Damascus without entering Syrian airspace, a military spokesperson told RIA. Russia’s defence ministry denounced what it said was Israel’s “common practice” of using civilian aircraft as a “shield”, Russia Today reported.Syria has to date struggled to repel Israeli airstrikes. In 2018, Bashar al-Assad’s forces accidentally shot down a reconnaissance plane belonging to its Russian allies while responding to an Israeli attack with anti-aircraft missiles, killing 15 crew members. Moscow held the Israeli air force accountable for the incident for allegedly using the Russian plane as cover.Spokespeople for the Israeli military and foreign ministry declined to comment.Israel does not normally comment on its military activity in Syria. Since the civil war broke out in 2011 it has carried out hundreds of airstrikes targeting Assad’s Iranian and Hezbollah allies, whose presence in Syria is regarded as an existential threat by Israel. Strikes normally target supply routes and infrastructure such as weapons depots.The Israel Defence Forces recently confirmed it has also begun operations in Iraq to stop Iran and its proxies from entrenching inside the country.Thursday’s pre-dawn strikes in Syria were the most intense in months, targeting al-Kiswah, Marj al-Sultan and the Baghdad Bridge in the vicinity of Damascus and South Izra in the Daraa countryside.The attack killed at least 23 Syrian and allied Iranian fighters, according to war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Unconfirmed reports said the senior Syrian Maj Gen Ismail Badran, chief commander of Mezzeh airbase, was killed. Syrian state media reported eight injuries and no deaths.In July last year Damascus accused Israel of “heinous aggression” after strikes south of Damascus and in Homs province led to the deaths of at least six civilians.Syria’s foreign ministry filed a complaint to the United Nations security council over the attack, demanding accountability, although the Observatory said the deaths could have occurred in the aftermath of the attack by the remnants of missile parts or the Syrian counter-attack itself."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4165306.1581085290!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"health experts say coronavirus case likely to occur in ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLaboratory technicians work on samples from people to be tested for the new coronavirus in Wuhan. Photograph: STRAFP via Getty ImagesIrish public health experts say they expect a case of the coronavirus to occur in Ireland. With 29 cases of the virus now reported across Europe, Ireland’s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the likelihood is that a case will occur here.“It’s not something we would be surprised by,” he said, adding that the strategy of the Department of Health and public health doctors was one of containment.So far, there have been no confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in Ireland. Fifteen suspected cases have occurred but were shown to be negative on testing.The virus, which originated in Wuhan in China in January, has led to more than 630 deaths. There have been more than 31,000 infections recorded, according to the latest figures.Ireland does not have any plans at present to step up checks on incoming flights, Dr Holohan told journalists at a technical briefing on Friday, though there could be circumstances in which the passengers on a specific flight could be screened. Point of entry screening is regarded as inefficient, he pointed out.Asked whether Ireland had any further plans to amend travel advice because of the virus, Dr Holohan said we were “in the hands” of the World Health Organisation (WHO), whose advice currently applies to people returning from mainland China only.The UK, which on Thursday reported a third case involving a traveller who contracted the virus in Singapore, has expanded the list of countries to which its travel advice applies Britain is free to do this after leaving the EU but Ireland follows the lead set by the European Centre for Disease Control.Dr Holohan acknowledged the situation was “fast-moving” and advised people to “stay abreast” of the situation. A communications network has been set up with GPs to ensure they are informed of the latest advice, and the issuing of personal protective equipment to doctors’ surgeries has begun, officials said.The WHO has warned the world is running out of masks and other equipment amid a surge in demand from efforts to curb the spread of the virus. Dr Holohan told RTÉ’s News at One that Ireland has “substantial supplies” at the moment, which are being distributed to GPs. Asked what quarantine arrangements were in place for suspected cases, Dr Holohan said Ireland’s approach was based on people self-isolating while symptoms were being checked, rather than quarantine.Head of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, Dr Cillian de Gacun, said the rising number of cases in China was “a concern” though the rate at which new cases were being reported in recent days had slowed.While they were questions about the capacity of China to test all new cases, scientists would be hoping to see a plateau in the outbreak over the coming weeks, he said.Dr Holohan said Ireland’s containment strategy involves recognising people with symptoms early and taking measures to prevent onward transmission.

Stop the cutbacks, she says people with learning disabilities need money how many homeless people are on the streets?“Michael Collins would not be resting in his grave if he found out what you are doing.”Meanwhile, on another corner of social media Sinn Féin posted details of its own opinion poll which puts it at 25 per cent against Fine Gael’s 17.

Go on. It’s like “crayon” or “spray on”. Whatever you find to rhyme, Ireland’s best-known version – Labour Senator and general election candidate Aodhán Ó Ríordáin – has an ear for the poetry of online campaigning.Unlike decidedly tone-deaf Fine Gael efforts, the former TD and junior minister has released a self-deprecating social media video that actually works. After numerous, and yes, humorous clips of people’s as Gaeilge grapples with his name, the 45-second Twitter video essentially boils down to the simple message that correct pronunciation doesn’t matter “as long as you vote for me on Saturday”.And for anyone who’s interested, he was always plain old Aidan anyway, says his mother, until he “went to UCD and lost the run of yourself”.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4165254.1581080799!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 varadkar predicts real difficulty in forming government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar with Fine Gael candidates for the Clare constituency Joe Carey (left) and Pat Breen (right), holding his 8-month-old grandaughter Aoibhin Breen, outside Clare FM during the last day of general election campaigning in Ennis, Co Clare. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA Wire Leo Varadkar has predicted “real difficulty” in forming government after the election. “If the polls are correct, then I think we are going to have real difficulty forming a government,” he told Clare FM. He was speaking in Ennis as parties make their final pitches to voters as the final day of the campaign is under way ahead of polls opening on Saturday morning.The election “three horse race” has taken everyone by surprise. “No election is easy. It has turned into is a three horse race - Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and Sinn Fein - which I think nobody would have anticipated at the start of this campaign, that it would be a three horse race, but it is,” Mr Varadkar said. “My fear is that a Fianna Fail-led government or a Sinn Fein-led government - or the two of them in bed together. That could set us backwards, so people have a big decision to make.” Mr Varadkar also said he would fight to retain leadership of Fine Gael in the event of his party losing the general election. Under party rules he would have to submit himself to a confidence vote. “If that were to happen, I would ask to stay on as party leader and lead the Opposition, and be ready to pick up the pieces in five years time after Fianna Fail do to the country what they usually do,” he said. On health, Mr Varadkar said he “deeply regrets” that anyone has to spend any time on a hospital trolley. “In a wealthy country like Ireland no-one should have to experience that, certainly their relatives should not have to either, and I know what it is like for the staff too.” But he said it is not true to say nothing was happening to fix the problems. The housing crisis has come up “in so many different way” during the election campaign, he accepted, saying issues ranged “from people who are paying rents that are far too high, to people in their thirties living at home who are trying to buy their first home, struggling to get a deposit, to the really sharp end of things which is families in emergency accommodation.”“But I actually, genuinely think we are making progress on this,” he said. Mr Varadkar said more houses are being built, house prices are leveling off, rents are going down and the number in emergency accommodation is falling back.Promises from other parties to double housing within a year “is not honest”, he added. Mr Varadkar said:“I think a vote for Fianna Fail is a vote for Sinn Fein in this election.”“There is a lot of people now in Fianna Fail - candidates all over the country - who have indicated in the past couple of weeks that they are open to coalition with Sinn Fein.”Mr Martin told reporters that any negotiations with like-minded parties will be based on policy. He has ruled out going into coalition with either Sinn Féin or Fine Gael and acknowledged that he hopes to talk to parties such as the Greens, Labour and Social Democrats after the election on Saturday.But when asked if he would advise Fianna Fail supporters to give their lower preferences to potential coalition partners in the Greens, Labour or Social Democrats, he declined to do so.“I am never that prescriptive in terms of what people do with their preferences - no, I am saying to people that we obviously want to maximise our seats and to obviously vote Fianna Fáil,” he said.“People should vote in order of their choice after that but in terms of the formation of Government I think people are hearing what I am saying but I don’t ever get into a position where I direct people (how to transfer).”“I think they (Greens, Labour and Social Democrats) will do much better than people are expecting ... part of the narrative of the last week perhaps has been trying to write them out of the equation which may not materialise.“I think they will do reasonably well,” said Mr Martin during a canvass on Trinity Bridge in Cork city centre which he found himself sharing with Fine Gael’s Jerry Buttimer as they sought to catch people going to work.Mr Martin said that, beyond the Greens, Labour and Social Democrats, the issue of support from “like-minded independents” such as the Healy-Raes or Mattie McGrath would be strictly policy based.“Our position is that the people are looking to the political parties to be at the centre of a new Government. But the key is the policies and the key is the programme.Mr Martin refused to be drawn on how many seats Fianna Fáil might win but he said he was confident it would emerge from the contest as Ireland’s biggest political party.“I have never given a specific number - but we had a very good day in 2016 coming from where we were. Obviously we want to increase our number of seats again.”“Fianna Fáil has the realistic, do-able programme for a new Government - particularly in terms of urgent action on the health services and housing with the building of new council and affordable homes.”“In terms of climate change, education and children with special needs, we have imaginative, innovative ideas and solutions to that as well.”“All within sustainable financial parameter - and I think it is a do-able programme unlike others which are clearly not deliverable given the lack of any significant financial details in the programmes from other parties.”Polling stations open at 7am and close at 10pm. The Department of Housing says voters do not need a polling card but will need to bring identification. The  will publish an exit poll as soon as voting ends on Saturday night to give the first indication of the outcome of general election 2020.

It is destined for Arranmore National School, one of two polling stations where the island’s electorate of 513 people will cast their votes.Voters on the islands off the coasts of Donegal, Mayo and Galway are going to the polls today, one day ahead of the rest of the country. Almost 2,200 voters are eligible to cast their ballot on the islands today those on the Cork islands will vote on Saturday.On Arranmore, the largest of the Donegal islands, Garda Byrne and the presiding officer, Sandra Callaghan, carry the ballot box into the classroom. The children’s books and toys have been tidied away to one side, and the room cleared a polling booth stands ready and waiting in the corner.Based in nearby Dungloe, Garda Byrne has accompanied ballot boxes to Arranmore and Inishfree during previous elections. “I love this bit,” she says. “I’ve been out on the island loads of times, but on polling day you get to meet people you wouldn’t otherwise see.”By 10am they are ready voting hours here are shorter, from 10am until 7.30pm, and a special ferry sailing has been laid on to bring the box back to the mainland immediately afterwards, ready for the count to begin in Letterkenny on Sunday morning.Each of the other islands have their own arrangements: on Gola, off the coast of Gweedore, voting takes place in the house of one Mr James Sweeney the polling hours are shorter, too, between 11am and 3pm, and the single ballot box is delivered by the Air Corps.On Inishfree, near Dungloe, only four people are eligible to vote.

After losing a particularly bitterly-fought election, he is reputed to have said: “The people have spoken, the bastards.” Predicting election campaigns in Ireland is a guessing game that sometimes presents itself as an inexact science. Opinion polls and the results of secondary elections such as council elections, byelections and European elections give you the direction of the wind. But the system we have in Ireland of multi-seat constituencies allied with transferable votes makes it a very difficult exercise to carry out with any degree of accuracy.No tally taken prior to voting could have told you that Bríd Smith of People Before Profit would win the last seat in Dublin South-Central in 2016, by less than 40 votes, from Fianna Fáil’s Catherine Ardagh, relying wholly on the distribution of a tiny surplus that had got Joan Collins over the line in a previous count.Usually, there are predictors. For this general election it was last year’s round of local and European elections, as well as the autumn opinion polls, plus the November byelections. But they have all been thrown out the window since the start of the campaign. In Lazarus fashion, Sinn Féin has confounded expectations and become the party for the strong prevailing mood of the electorate: and that is change. Nobody foresaw it, not even Sinn Féin. The party now lacks candidates in constituencies where it might have won a second seat. Fine Gael has tumbled down. Fianna Fáil looks like it’s treading water a bit but there might be a latent support there. Of the rest, only the Greens look stronger, but outside Dublin, they remain niche.The 33rd Dáil will have an extra two seats compared with the outgoing Dáil, bringing the total up to 160. That means extra seats in Cavan-Monaghan, Kildare South and Dublin Central. In addition, Laois and Offaly combine into one constituency, with five seats overall rather than six.Here is my tally, broken down by party and where I see they may gain some seats and lose others.1. Dublin Mid-West: This would be a technical gain as the party has no seat here after losing the byelection for Frances Fitzgerald’s former seat. Emer Higgins should safely take one seat out of four and the party might even consider itself in with a shout for a second seat, although that is a long shot.2. Cork North-Central: This is another technical gain as there is a vacant seat. Fine Gael has no seat there since Dara Murphy’s resignation in December. Colm Burke should easily win one seat for the party in the four-seat constituency.3. Tipperary:  The target is seat held by Independent Séamus Healy. Fine Gael has gone out on a limb by picking two new and relatively unknown candidates. It had a full quota in 2016 but terrible vote management and candidate selection lost it its seat. The party’s strong local election performance should provide it with the basis for a seat here at the expense of an Independent. Was it a mistake by Mary Newman Julian not to contest the local elections, unlike her running mate Garret Ahearn? Could they repeat the mistakes of 2016? The mood has darkened considerably here.4. Cavan-Monaghan: There is an extra seat in this constituency. Fianna Fáíl already has two and is unlikely to win three. Sinn Féin has traditionally been not as strong in Cavan as in Monaghan. But the surge in the poll now means that Pauline Tully could edge out Fine Gael’s TP O’Reilly for the last seat. This would be a big body blow.5. Cork North-West: The target is a Fianna Fáil seat. A one-point increase needed in vote share compared with 2016. John Paul O’Shea ran as an Independent in 2016 and did well. Now under the Fine Gael banner will run Fianna Fáíl close.6. Cork East: Target is a Sinn Féin seat. A two percentage-point increase in vote share is required compared with 2016. Again a close battle with Fianna Fáil looked in prospect to topple a precarious Sinn Féin seat. Pa O’Driscoll is based in the northern end of the constituency and while the teacher has a high profile and is a strong campaigner, he might struggle for transfers in the latter counts. On balance, it’s hard to see Sinn Féin not holding the seat, even though the party is not showing as strongly in Munster.7. Dublin-Rathdown: Shane Ross is the target. A five percentage-point increase in vote share required compared with 2016. Neale Richmond will need to put in a huge performance to create one of the shocks of the day by taking out Ross. And now, it is not only Ross but also Fianna Fáil’s Shay Brennan he has to worry about.8. Kerry: The target is a Sinn Féin seat. A five-point increase is required. The Sinn Féin seat is no longer in such danger. Fine Gael’s candidate Michael Kennelly comes from a well-known Listowel GAA family. Fianna Fáil looks marginally stronger though after the local elections but there is a neater geographical ide between Kennelly and sitting TD Brendan Griffin. May be moot now if Pa Daly can harness all of the Martin Ferris vote.9. Longford-Westmeath: The target is a Labour Party seat. Another ding-dong battle between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael for a vulnerable seat, this time the one vacated by Labour’s Willie Penrose. It will boil down to be a bout between two Longford candidates. Fianna Fáíl is stronger in the constituency overall but Fine Gael is stronger in Longford (it won 39 per cent of the vote in last year’s local elections. Its candidate Micheál Carrigy has a high profile. A bellwether constituency. Don’t rule out Sinn Féin.10. Galway East: A five-point gain is required to take a seat off Seán Canney. This will be a local battle, between the outgoing Tuam Independent and Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil rivals from the same area. Fine Gael’s Peter Roche performed strongly in the local elections but Fianna Fáil had a big day in Tuam, taking four out of seven. Again very, very tight. But on opinion poll evidence you would have to favour Fianna Fáil, or even Canney holding.11. Louth: A two-point increase is required. The target is Independent Peter Fitzpatrick. Fine Gael has only one seat here after Fitzpatrick’s resignation from the party in 2018. Dundalk-based councillor John McGahon will be one of five jousting for the last seat and might just come up short.12. Limerick City: The target is a Labour seat. A five-point rise on 2016 is required. Others, Fianna Fáil and the Greens, look stronger in the battle for the final seat with Jan O’Sullivan.1. Dún Laoghaire: to Fianna FáilGreens. A certainty. Fine Gael holds three seats out of four because outgoing ceann comhairle Seán Barrett was automatically returned in 2016. He is not standing this time. The party won 25 per cent of the vote in 2016. Now it’s looking at the dismal scenario of returning only one seat here.2. Dublin North-West: to Fianna Fáíl. Probability is high. Noel Rock is a very doughty campaigner but he is up against it this time. He narrowly saw off Fianna Fáil’s Paul McAuliffe in 2016 but his rival is in a much stronger position now, and Fianna Fáil had a very strong local election here. Sinn Féin has been on the slide here but it would be hard to see Dessie Ellis’s fall being so dramatic as to lose.3. Galway West: to Greens or Fianna Fáil. Probability is medium to high. Like Clare the party managed to retain two seats with only 24 per cent of the vote, and relied heavily on Labour transfers. Its two TDs, Seán Kyne and Hildegarde Naughton, are high profile but would need to increase the party’s share of the vote against parties whose support levels are rising.4. Dublin Bay South: to the Labour Party. Probability low to medium. The second Fine Gael seat could be in play here if Labour’s Kevin Humphreys gains traction. A strong Green performance could also impact. If the  opinion poll for Fine Gael is correct, this might make one of its seats in this “true blue” constituency vulnerable.5. Wexford:  to Independent or Sinn Féin. Paul Kehoe clung on in 2016 will face a challenge again. Sinn Féin’s Johnny Mythen performed well in the recent byelection and the party is flying in the polls. Verona Murphy’s candidacy could also have an impact on Kehoe.6. Clare: to IndependentFianna Fáíl. The party won less votes than Fianna Fáíl in 2016 but still managed to retain both seats thanks to Labour transfers. Fianna Fáil seems to have a very strong ticket and should win a second seat. The decision by Michael Harty not to run will be a boon to it. Fine Gael’s only vulnerability is losing to another Independent candidate in the shape of Michael McNamara.7. Dublin South-Central: to GreensFianna Fáil. Catherine Byrne has survived here against all the odds but this might be one election too many. Fianna Fáíl looks strong for a seat as do the Greens. Something will have to give and it could be Fine Gael.8. Meath East: to Sinn Féin. Darren O’Rourke was not all that far away in 2016 and will not be all that far away this time either. Many of those who live on the Dublin side of the constituency are commuters who are one of the big groups clamouring for change. Regina Doherty’s seat, in particular, is vulnerable.1. Dún Laoghaire: There is an extra seat. Needs a one per cent increase in vote share compared with the 2016 general election. Last time out this was a three-seater because outgoing Ceann Comhairle Seán Barrett was a TD. Fianna Fáil do have a quota so should pick up a seat. It is running two candidates, Mary Hanafin and Cormac Devlin\u0026nbspand there is a danger they could cancel each other out. The Greens look strong for a seat here.2. Dublin North-West: Target is a Fine Gael seat. Needs a one per cent rise in support from the 2016 general election. Finglas-based Paul McAuliffe topped the poll amid a strong Fianna Fáil performance in the local elections and is current Lord Mayor. Fine Gael’s Noel Rock relied hugely on Labour transfers to pip him last time out and he looks very vulnerable.3. Dublin Central: There is an extra seat in this constituency. Needs a five percentage-point increase since 2016: This moves from a three- to four-seat constituency. Mary Fitzpatrick would need to add five points to her 11 per cent showing in 2016 though she performed very strongly in her own electoral area in the local elections. Mary Lou McDonald will top the poll and the Greens also look as if they they may pip Garry Gannon of the Social Democrats.4. Dublin South-Central: One per cent increase required compared with 2016. Target is Independent or People Before Profit seats, or perhaps Fine Gael. Catherine Ardagh lost out by less than 40 votes in 2016. She has had a high profile since as her party’s leader in the Seanad and Fianna Fáil did well in the local elections. Only seat safe here is Sinn Féin and she is an odds-on favourite to regain the seat once held by her late father, Seán Ardagh. Sinn Féin would have won two seats here if it ran two candidates.5. Clare: Target is an Independent or Fine Gael seat. Two percentage-point rise required since 2016: Fine Gael’s second seat here was very vulnerable until Independent Michael Harty announced he would not contest the election. Fianna Fáil seems to have got its formula right. Cathal Crowe is a strong candidate who did himself no harm with his boycott of the proposed Royal Irish Constabulary event. It had five per cent more votes at 30 per cent than Fine Gael in 2016 but won only seat, while its rival won two. It looks as if Fine Gael will be the loser here, with Independent and former Labour TD Michael McNamara and Green Róisín Garvey in the hunt for the fourth seat.6. Galway East: Target is an Independent seat held by Seán Canney: Six percentage-point increase needed compared with 2016: Tuam is going to be the battleground here. Canney is defending a seat he won handily. The other two seats are in the southeastern Loughrea-Portumna axis held by Anne Rabbitte of Fianna Fáil and in the Athenry-GortKinvara southern axis held by Fine Gael’s Ciarán Cannon. The Independent brand around Tuam, so strong from 2014-2016, receded in last year’s local elections. Fine Gael has chosen a strong councillor, Peter Roche who topped the poll in Tuam. But Fianna Fáil won four out of seven council seats in Tuam, and that might give it an edge. It has chosen Cllr Donagh Killilea, a son of the late TD and MEP Mark Killilea. He’s come late into the race though but at this stage he might be ahead of Roche. Don’t underestimate Canney.7. Kerry: Target is a Sinn Féin seat. An eight percentage-point increase needed here from 2016. Sinn Féin was vulnerable but not any more. Fianna Fáil had very good local elections and the addition of Tralee councillor Norma Foley gives it a very strong ticket and may dent the impact Michael Healy-Rae had in the northern part of the constituency in 2016. Norma Moriarty is comfortably placed in the Iveragh Peninsula in the south while sitting TD John Brassil is from Ballyheigue, geographically close to Foley. Fine Gael has a strong Listowel-based councillor Mike Kennelly as its second candidate. But Pa Daly, seen as a beaten docket a month ago, is now back in the frame for Sinn Féin.8. Longford-Westmeath: Target is a Labour seat. Seven percentage-point increase needed from 2016: Fianna Fáil is the largest party in the entire constituency but the last seat may turn out to be a battle between Fianna Fáíl’s Joe Flaherty and Micheál Carrigy for the “Longford” seat, a county in which Fine Gael is stronger. And now Sorca Clarke of Sinn Féin has moved into view.9. Carlow-Kilkenny: The target is a Sinn Féin or Fine Gael seat and a two percentage-point increase is required. Winning three out of five seats is always a massive task and if Fianna Fáíl pulls it off here, it will be well on its way to government. John McGuinness and Bobby Aylward ided the Kilkenny vote very well last time. Sinn Féin’s Kathleen Funchion is no longer vulnerable. Fianna Fáil’s Carlow candidate Jennifer Murnane O’Connor came very close in 2016 and could get over the line this time. But will it be at the expense of Pat Deering of Fine Gael, or of her running mate, Aylward?10. Cork East: Target is a Sinn Féin seat. Four percentage-point increase required since 2016. Another Sinn Féin TD, Pat Buckley, looked like facing a challenge following a poor local election for the party in Co Cork but now is seen as safe, even though the Sinn Féin vote is not as strong in Munster. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s second candidates had only a handful of votes separating them the last time around. The party’s second candidates are at opposite ends of the constituency. It’s now marginal.11. Laois-Offaly: A Fine Gael seat is the target. A four percentage-point increase in required. It is a Fianna Fáil heartland and Fine Gael’s Marcella Corcoran Kennedy had a middling vote in 2016. However, Fine Gael did well in locals and it would be a tall order for Fianna Fáil to win three out of five here. Brian Stanley of Sinn Féin remains strong in Portlaoise.12. Louth: A Sinn Féin or Independent seat is the target. A nine point increase is needed. Fianna Fáil could have a higher percentage of votes than Fine Gael but might struggle with getting enough transfers to bring the party over the line. Its second candidate, James Byrne, is based in Drogheda where there is already a number of strong candidates. Sinn Féin now looks as if it will hold on to two which would make it a tricky proposition for Byrne to join Declan Breathnach in the Dáíl.13. Kildare South: An extra seat. A four percentage-point increase is required. An effective three-seater because Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl was elected here. Fianna Fáil won two out of three in 2016 when it was actually a three-seater but a taller order this time as Mark Wall of Labour could sneak in. Suzanne Doyle is a high-profile running mate for sitting TD Fiona O’Loughlin and there is potential there. But it’s less straightforward than 2016. Fiona McLoughlin Healy and Cathal Berry are two Independents, one of whom might spring a surprise.14. Dublin South-West: The target is an Independent seat. Fianna Fáil got a quota here in 2016 and would need an eight-point increase in first-preference votes plus good vote management to win a second seat. However, candidate Charlie O’Connor had a mammoth local election in Tallaght and could squeeze through in a big field at the expense of Katherine Zappone or Paul Murphy.15. Dublin Fingal: The target is a Fine Gael seat. A five percentage-point boost is needed. On paper the party has a chance here of taking a second seat after getting 1.4 quotas in 2016. However, the Greens will now need to take it in a scenario where Fine Gael is winning no seats. A very tall order.16. Galway West: A five percentage-point increase is required. Fianna Fáil won more votes here than Fine Gael in 2016 but still returned only one TD. One of the Fine Gael TDs could be vulnerable but the disparity between Eamon Ó Cuív’s votes, and his running mates’ have always been too high. Against that, the party had a good local election in the city, and Ollie Crowe is an experienced candidate. His chances are remote though given the crowded field, and the strengths of other newish candidates such as Niall Ó Tuathail of the Social Democrats, Pauline O’Reilly of the Green Party, and (perhaps) Mairéad Farrell of Sinn Féin.17. Limerick City: A Labour Party seat is the target. Fianna Fáil has a strong ticket in Willie O’Dea and James Collins, a cousin of Niall’s. Sinn Féin’s Maurice Quinlivan looked on shaky ground a month ago but no more. Jan O’Sullivan might be more precarious.18. Dublin Rathdown: The target is the Independent Seat. An eight-point increase over 2016 is required. This was going to be the only constituency in the country where Fianna Fáíl had no seat. But in the last week, Shay Brennan has been talked up as a possible challenger for Shane Ross’s seat, which has come as a huge surprise.1. Wicklow: Could miss out to Greens, Social Democrats or Independents. Stephen Donnelly won almost 21 per cent of the vote here in 2016 but as a Social Democrat. With 13 per cent of the vote in 2016, Fianna Fáil would need to add at least 9 per cent to have any chance of taking a second seat. The big unknown is how Donnelly’s vote will be impacted by him being a Fianna Fáil candidate. It will certainly be a negative drag despite his profile as his party’s health spokesman. Valerie Cox’s candidacy will not be a help.3. Sligo-Leitrim: Again Fianna Fáil won two out of four here on 32 per cent of the vote. Fine Gael had a good local election in Sligo but Fianna Fáil is still a little stronger. Marian Harkin’s entry into the race has upset all that planning. If she knocks out a sitting TD, the most likely is one of the two Fianna Fáil deputies. But there is a scenario where Fine Gael – which again messed up its candidate strategy here – could end up with zero seats.4. Kildare North: Could lose to Greens or Labour Party. Fianna Fáil won the second seat here on the back of a lowish first preference. The Green Party candidate, Vincent P Martin, might pose a threat, as might Labourveteran Emmet Stagg. Now Sinn Féin could also be a player here. On balance, it could be a hold, especially if vote management remains as disciplined as it was in 2016.5. Roscommon-Galway: Fianna Fáil is potentially vulnerable to Fine Gael in the only constituency where it has no representation. Fine Gael’s Aisling Dolan is based in Ballinasloe and not widely known in Roscommon. Fine Gael had a poor local election in Roscommon. Besides Denis Naughten is still regarded as proxy Fine Gael. It will be interesting to see if the addition of the high-profile Órla Leyden will affect the dynamic between herself and sitting TD, Eugene Murphy. On balance, a hold.6. Dublin Bay South: Labour poses a threat. Jim O’Callaghan got elected with just over half a quota in 2016. He has been helped by having a high profile but if he fails to add to his first preferences, he might find Labour’s Kevin Humphreys breathing down his neck. He relied a lot on transfers from Chris Andrews of Sinn Féin in 2016 and may not get as many. The absence of Michael McDowell from the slate will help his cause. Very unlikely to lose.1. Donegal: Target is an Independent seat. It needs a one-point increase in vote share over 2016. Pádraig Mac Lochlainn narrowly lost out to Thomas Pringle in 2016 using an ill-advised three-candidate strategy. This time there is just two candidates and the party has high hopes it can win back its second seat. Will be tight though.2. Dublin West: Target is Labour PartyS-PBP. A two percentage point increase needed over 2016. Paul Donnelly has been knocking on the door in Dublin West and was the last remaining unsuccessful candidate in 2016. However, Sinn Féin did not have a great local election but it is in constituencies like this that it has a gale wind behind it. Ruth Coppinger looks in real trouble, as does Labour. A certain win.3. Wexford: Target is Fine Gael. A two-point increase is needed. Another constituency where Sinn Féin came close to winning a seat in 2016. There have been mixed messages this year, a poor local election and a slightly better byelection performance. However, the momentum has returned and Johnny Mythen might be the fit. He is located to the north of the constituency which might be a handicap.4. Cavan-Monaghan: There is an extra seat in this constituency. A six-point increase is needed. This is one of the few constituencies where Sinn Féin has the potential to win a second seat. Cavan has always been a bit of a challenge for it but this time Pauline Tully is highly experienced and has a chance alongside Matt Carthy.5. Mayo: Target is a Fine Gael seat. Rose Conway-Walsh is an excellent Senator but always seemed to be coming up a little short in Mayo. But the surge in party support will certainly make her a contender here, and if she is ahead of the Greens’ Saoirse McHugh, which is likely, her transfers might push the Sinn Féin candidate over the line.6. Longford-Westmeath: A new planet is discovered in the galaxy. Sorca Clarke was seen as a mid-table finisher until a fortnight ago but now Sinn Féin can challenge in this constituency. I still see the final seat going to either Fianna Fáíl or Fine Gael.1. Dublin Mid-West: to Fine Gael. This was almost certain before the campaign started but the party will now be in the mix to retain its two TDs in this four-seat constituency. Its challenge will be to stay ahead of Gino Kenny, the Greens and Paul Gogarty.2. Louth: to the Labour Party. Possibility is medium to low. The party always had a tall order on its hands retaining two seats in Louth following Gerry Adams’s retirement. And while it won more than 24 per cent of the vote in the local elections, it needs a higher volume of number ones to compensate for lack of transfers. A fortnight ago, I would have said No. Now, I would say it has a good chance of holding.3. Cork East: to Fianna FáilFine Gael. This a bit of long shot. Pat Buckley looked a goner last May after the party bombed in the locals. But it’s bounced back and so has he. While Sinn Féin not showing up as highly in Munster, he can ward off the challenge from Fianna Fáíl and Fine Gael.Other constituencies: I had another eight constituencies marked as potential losses for Sinn Féin. But that was a fortnight ago. And the world has changed since then.1. Louth: Target is Sinn FéinIndependent. A two percentage-point increase is needed compared with 2016. Despite coming out of government, Labour very narrowly lost a number of seats and this was one of them. Ged Nash will be buoyed by the party’s strong showing in its stronghold of Drogheda and is in contention to take a seat, although it will be a scrap.2. Dublin Bay North: The party is targeting seats vacated by Independents. A two-point increase in vote share is needed. This constituency is always unpredictable because of the huge number of candidates. Aodhán Ó Ríordáin’s passage to regain a seat is helped hugely by the retirements of Finian McGrath and Tommy Broughan. If he does not win, Labour can pack up and call it a day.3. Kildare South: There is an extra seat in this constituency. A six point increase is needed. The addition of a seat will favour Mark Wall to take a position once held by his father, Jack. However, he needs to spread his support beyond his Athy base and may be vulnerable to Fianna Fáil’s Suzanne Doyle, or an asymmetric challenge from two strong Independents.4. Cork North-Central: Target is Solidarity-People Before Profit. Five per cent increase needed compared to 2016 election. Solidarity’s Mick Barry will struggle to recapture 15 per cent of the vote from 2016 but will not lose his seat easily. Labour’s John Maher performed well in the byelections and has established a profile after winning a council seat. Labour has not really recovered fully here after being floored in 2016. Maher may be in contention for the last seat but confidence has ebbed a little since start of campaign.5. Waterford:  Target is an Independent seat. A four-point increase is required. With John Halligan’s resignation, there will be a spare seat here. The big parties each have one seat and Labour looks the best placed of the small parties to benefit, through John Pratt. He will have to fend off Marc Ó Cathasaigh of the Greens who are growing here but also – more immediately – Cllr Matt Shanahan, the Independent who has led the high-profile campaign to improve services at Waterford hospital. Pratt may be behind the curve a little here.6. Dublin South-Central: Target is Fine GaelPeople Before Profit. A four percentage-point boost is needed. Like Dublin Bay North, this constituency will involve a scramble for the last seat. If Labour stays ahead of Greens and other left-leaning candidates, Rebecca Moynihan could come close. She is a very impressive candidate but it’s a slightly long shot.7. Kildare North:  Target is Fianna Fáil. A four-point increase is needed. Veteran Emmet Stagg was not that far away in 2016. He will need to stay ahead of the Greens and then rely on heavy transfers from them. Marginal.8. Dublin Central: There is an extra seat here. A five-point increase is needed. Another veteran Joe Costello is the Labour standard bearer and will be in the mix in the final shake-up. Might not happen this time though. Unlikely.9. Dún Laoghaire: Cllr Juliet O’Connell has had an impressive breakthrough year after getting elected as a councillor last year. She’s still comparatively new though and might suffer a slight profile deficit, given her late entry into the race. It must not be forgotten Labour held a seat here for many years but to win she would really have to dislodge Richard Boyd Barrett, who holds the sole left-wing seat in the constituency. Very slim chance.1. Longford-Westmeath: Potential loss to Fine GaelFianna Fáil. Possibility is high. Willie Penrose is retiring having defied all odds, and laws of gravity, in 2016. It’s hard to see Labour retaining this seat even though former county footballer, Alan Mangan, has a high profile.2. Dublin West: to Green PartySinn Féin. Possibility is high. The Greens look poised to win a seat here, with Fine Gael seeking a second seat, and Sinn Féin is also poised to take a seat at the expense of Ruth Coppinger. Joan Burton held the seat here in 2016 against the odds but you sense the tide might have run out on her.3. Limerick City:  Jan O’Sullivan looked comparatively safe until Sinn Féin managed to get back on the pitch. If Fianna Fáíl gets a second seat here it could be at her expense. She survived in 2016 and she is likely to survive again.1. Dún Laoghaire: Extra seat. A 10-point boost is needed. If the party does not win a seat here, there will be no Green surge. It had a big local election here and should win its first seat in the constituency.2. Dublin West: Target is LabourSolidarity Party. An eight-point increase is required. Green Party chairman Roderic O’Gorman has been its candidate here for some time now and is expected to win a seat on the back of a really strong local election performance by him and colleagues.3. Dublin Bay North: Target is Sinn FéinIndependent. An eight-point rise is required. The party was nowhere here in 2016 but again the momentum is with it after the local elections in a constituency where it did particularly well. David Healy won’t get it easy though and will have to fight it out with the Social Democrats, Independent John Lyons, and Labour for two seats.4. Dublin Central: Extra seat. A seven percentage-point increase is needed. The party did well in both local election areas with Ciarán Cuffe topping the poll in the north inner city. Its leader on Dublin City Council Neasa Hourigan is the candidate. She is impressive. She seems slightly ahead of Garry Gannon of the Social Democrats in the race for the final seat.5. Dublin South-West: Target is an Independent seat. An eight-point increase is needed. The party will have an impact on Fine Gael and the Independent Minister Katherine Zappone. It elected councillors comfortably in all the middle-class areas of the constituency and Cllr Francis Noel Duffy (the husband of deputy leader Catherine Martin) is favoured to take a seat.6. Cork South-Central: Target is Sinn Féin. A six point boost is required. Lorna Bogue will need to mount a huge challenge to dislodge Sinn Féin’s Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire for the last seat in a constituency of heavy hitters Micheál Martin, Michael McGrath and Simon Coveney are the other TDs. She is very much on the left of the party and will compete for transfers from smaller groups and left-leaning Independents.7. Wicklow:  Target is Fianna FáilFine Gael. A six-point increase is needed. The party is hardly above five per cent in Wicklow but can benefit from transfers in a constituency where there are always multiple candidates. Fianna Fáil (Stephen Donnelly) and Sinn Féin votes are both expected to drop somewhat and the Green candidate Steven Matthews had an impressive haul of votes in the locals last year. With so many candidates, including Valerie Cox, it might be too big an ask.8. Galway West:  Target is Fine GaelIndependent. A six-point increase in vote share from 2016 is required. Pauline O’Reilly is a strong candidate who will be in the mix after the party had a good local elections in Galway City and in Connemara. The question is how strong the vote will be outside the city. She is also competing against Catherine Connolly for votes who is very strong in the city. There is also the impressive Niall Ó Tuathail of the Social Democrats and Sinn Féin’s Mairéad Farrell is now back in the frame. No certainty at all.9. Waterford: Target is an Independent seat. A six-point increase is required. There is a seat for the taking by a smaller party in Waterford with Halligan standing down. Former senator Grace O’Sullivan would have been a strong favourite if she had not run for Europe. Her replacement Marc Ó Cathasaigh will need to battle hard to break through against a strong challenge from Labour and from Matt Shanahan. He might just snatch it.10. Kildare North: Target is Fianna Fáíl. A seven-point increase in vote share is required. A commuter constituency where the Greens made a big breakthrough in the local elections winning three seats on the council. Naas-based Vincent P Martin, brother of deputy leader Catherine Martin, is a smooth campaigner and will give Fianna Fáíl a run for its money in the battle for the last seat.11. Louth: Target is Independent. A five-point increase of vote share is required. There were high hopes a decade ago that Mark Dearey might make a breakthrough for the Greens here. The former senator is a popular figure but would need to double the party’s vote in the constituency.12. Clare: This is another constituency which has seen a candidate or party emerge out of nowhere. There’s definitely a seat for an Independent or smaller party here following the retirement of Michael Harty. Róisín Garvey is a straight-talking west Clare woman who has made a big impact and will be vying with Michael McNamara for that seat.1. Dublin Central: Extra seat. A one-point increase is needed. Gary Gannon changed local electoral areas in the locals and was comfortably elected. He came very close in 2016, enjoys a high profile and will be in a battle with the Greens, Fianna Fáil and Labour for one of the final two seats here.2. Dublin Bay North: Target is Sinn FéinIndependents. Another very solid Social Democrats performer is Cian O’Callaghan. The forward momentum of the Greens and John Lyons might stymie his chances though.3. Galway West: Target is Fine GaelIndependent. A five-point increase in vote share required. Niall Ó Tuathail was another Social Democrats’ star in 2016 with a strong showing in Galway West. Has he maintained the progress? Some would consider it ill advised for him not to have contested the local election. Council seats are seen as springboards for national politics. Still in with a strong chance.4. Wicklow: Target is Fianna Fáil. Jennifer Whitmore had a very good local election and topped the poll in Greystones, Donnelly’s stomping ground. He got 20 per cent last time when he ran for the Social Democrats. But a lot of that was a personal vote. Wicklow can be very unpredictable. Nobody knows how well Donnelly will do flying under the Fianna Fáil banner. Valerie Cox is an unknown quantity. Whitmore could very well be in contention for the final seat if she manages to capitalise on her local election performance.1. Cork North-Central: to Labour Party. Mick Barry had 15 per cent of the vote here in 2016 but the signs in the local elections, and in the recent byelection, were ominous. He is going to struggle but his vote will certainly be higher than the locals suggested. Facing threats from Labour and, possibly, the Greens.2. Dublin South-Central: to Fianna Fáil. Bríd Smith won with only a handful of votes to spare in 2016 and could be vulnerable this time to Fianna Fáil, the Greens, the Social Democrats and Labour. Some see this as a battle between her and Joan Collins in that left-wing space, even though both are based in different parts of the constituency.3. Dubin Mid-West: to IndependentGreens or Sinn Féin. Gino Kenny came from nowhere to win a seat in 2016 and this popular and sincere TD might just hang on, partly on the back of his championing medicinal cannabis, which has given him a national profile. There are two left-wing seats in the constituency, and Sinn Féin is now looking to win a second. Another threat will come from an Independent candidate, possibly Paul Gogarty.4. Dublin West: Vulnerable to Sinn Féin. Ruth Coppinger has been an indefatigable worker and has a national profile. But so do the other TDs, Leo Varadkar, Burton and Jack Chambers. Her seat is under huge threat.5. Dún Laoghaire: To Fianna Fáil or the Greens. There has always been a left-wing seat in this constituency, and Richard Boyd Barrett might just hold on to it. However, that would mean getting in ahead of one of the two big parties, or the Greens.6. Dublin South-West: to Fianna Fail or Greens. It’s very hard to predict how Paul Murphy will fare, in his new role as the sole Rise TD in the Dáil. He did very well in 2016 on the back of the water protests but might find it difficult to maintain his support levels in the constituency. The decision by Solidarity to run Sandra Fay against her former party colleagues sounds ludicrous and could have an adverse impact on him. Both are running under the S-PBP banner.1. Dublin Mid-West (Paul Gogarty): Target is People Before Profit. Gogarty could take the fourth seat on the back of a reasonably good outing in the byelection.2. Sligo-Leitrim (Marian Harkin): Target is Fianna Fáil. The former MEP and TD has a very big cachet in the constituency and was wooed by Fine Gael. That offer might play a bit against her but she will be a threat to Fianna Fáíl.3. Wexford (Verona Murphy): Target is Fine Gael. Murphy is as well-known as she is controversial and early in the campaign was seen poised to take a seat at the expense of Paul Kehoe. However, Sinn Féin’s Johnny Mythen might top the poll and that might put paid to her chances.4. Clare (Michael McNamara): Target is IndependentFine Gael. There is an outgoing Independent TD, Michael Harty, who is retiring. Clare has a tradition of electing Independents and it might prove lucky for the former Labour Party TD.5. Waterford (Matt Shanahan): The “hospital candidate” has a very high profile locally and loss of hospital services is always a touchstone issue. Shanahan is in with a chance and will be vying with the Greens and Labour for the final seat.5. Dublin Bay North (John Lyons): The former People Before Profit councillor has an excellent track record on Dublin City Council and could cause an upset here against one of the three smaller left-leaning parties vying for the final seat.1. Laois-Offaly (Carol Nolan): Laois and Offaly were two separate three-seat constituencies in 2016. Now, it’s a five-seater and former Sinn Féin TD Carol Nolan could be the obvious loser.2. Tipperary (Seamus Healy): to Fine Gael. Healy has been a great survivor but a change of mood might see him struggle.3. Donegal (Thomas Pringle): to Sinn Féin. Pringle has also been a solid vote-getter but Sinn Féin has been working really hard since 2016 to regain a seat.4. Galway East (Seán Canney): to Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. Canney is a Minister of State and a hard constituency worker but will find it hard to resist the two bigger parties. His best hope is to stay ahead of their Tuam-based candidates.5. Dublin South-West (Katherine Zappone): to GreensFianna Fáil.Very hard to gauge how the Minister for Children will do. She benefitted from anti-establishment transfers in 2016 but may be able to trade on her performance as Minister with another set of voters.6. Dublin Rathdown (Shane Ross): to Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil: This is a very fickle constituency and this year’s poll topper is next year’s also-ran. Ross’s star has been waning here and his is under strong pressure from Neale Richmond and (surprisingly) Shay Brennan. However, he seems a little stronger now than at this time last year, having considerably upped his performance as Minister.8. Louth (Peter Fitzpatrick): to Fine Gael. It’s hard to know how the Independent TD, formerly of Fine Gael, will do without a party banner. He is the chairman of Louth GAA this year and that is always a boon. But there are some very big hitters among his rivals and it will be difficult for him to survive.Harry McGee is political correspondent with The The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Prison officer jailed after admitting sexual relationship with drug baron Curtis \u0026#39Cocky\u0026#39 WarrenLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowPolitics latest news: Boris Johnson appoints first female ambassador to Washington Pangolin identified as potential link for coronavirus spreadComment: As the panicked EU goes into Brexit meltdown, Britain finally has the upper handBoris honeymoon under way as nearly half are satisfied with him doing his jobLiam Gallagher\u0026#39s son and Ringo Starr\u0026#39s grandson \u0026#39had fight in Tesco\u0026#39, court hears\u0026#39Brussels is reneging on its word\u0026#39 -  readers on the week\u0026#39s top storiesGP who molested women at his surgery handed three life sentencesFrance demands UK aligns with EU rules forever in return for Brexit trade dealComment: Where is the money coming from for Sajid Javid\u0026#39s big Brexit budgetary bonanza?Passenger plane forced into emergency landing after coming under fire over SyriaPhillip Schofield reveals he is gay after \u0026#39heartbreaking conversations\u0026#39 with familyShamima Begum loses first stage of legal challenge against decision to revoke British citizenshipUS Election 2020 Democratic primary race: Who is winning the battle for delegates?The charts that show how US politics is polarised at record levelsHow popular is Donald Trump?

So when the petite, high-heeled and unveiled blonde took her place at the front of the courtroom in northeastern Syria, he quickly averted his eyes.“It’s considered haram in ISIS’s version of Islam to look a strange woman in the eye,” Judge Amina told the  from her office just off the court, laughing as she recalled the suspect’s discomfort. “Perhaps it has been years since he saw a woman like me,” said Amina, who asked to be identified only by a first name for her security. “I ordered him three times to look at me, but he refused. He just stared at the ground for the whole trial.”Amina is one of half a dozen judges sitting at a special terrorism court near the city of Qamishli, in the autonomous Kurdish region of Syria known as Rojava.The Kurds, which established a breakaway administration in 2013, have built a justice system from scratch based on Rojava\u0027s secular, socialist-influenced constitution, without any recognition from the Syrian government or the outside world.So far they have tried only locals - 6,000 of them in total - but on Thursday it was announced they would begin hearing the cases of foreign suspects too.The Kurds have for years bore the responsibility for terrorists who came from all over the world to fight with Isil. Their governments have refused responsibility for them, so they languish in prisons and camps across the north-east.Desperate to win legitimacy for their fledgling state, the Kurds have abolished the death penalty, which is still legal under Syrian state law, and offered reduced sentences to Isil members who hand themselves in.The allegations some of the suspects are facing are serious  - crimes against humanity, genocide, the rape and enslavement of the minority Yazidi people, mass murder and kidnapping.The harshest sentence she can pass is life in prison, which translates to a 20-year sentence. This is usually reserved for what she calls the “top-tier jihadists” the emirs, leaders and frontline fighters.In the “second-tier” category, which includes those who worked Isil’s sharia or military administration, she usually passes a sentence of one-two years. The third tier are those she considers to have been forced” to work for Isil for money, who are not ideologically driven and served in menial roles. For those, more often than not she lets them go free.She can see as many as five suspects a day, she says. Few appear to have any legal representation.Amina, who is 47 but looks half her age, wonders whether prison is the answer for the most serious offenders.“These people are a danger to the whole world and I don’t think the answer is prison,” she told the  during a visit last year to Rojava. “Prison will not change people who think it is OK to rape and enslave a Yazidi woman, to kill her if she does not obey.”The detention centres of north-east Syria are overflowing. Journalists who have been given access to them report seeing prisoners sleeping shoulder-to-shoulder on the ground, sometimes 50 to a cell.“They’re all great liars too, I watch them speaking on TV telling the world they were all cooks and mechanics,” Amina said. “Every one of them stands in my courtroom tries and tells me they are a cook or a mechanic. No one was actually fighting it seems!,” she said, incredulous, as she pushed back the sunglasses on her head.But she claims there is a wealth of evidence against many of the defendants, mostly from civilian witnesses or Isil’s own propaganda.She sends me a video over What’sApp that shows four men executing a young man to death at point-blank range, smiling at the camera as they do it. Isil’s black flag flies in the corner of the screen.“One of those men was a defendant in my courtroom,” she said. “He denied his crimes to my face, but when I presented him with ISIS\u0027s slick, high-resolution video, he went silent.”She complains that the burden should not be on Kurds to deal with the detritus of the Islamic State.“We fought ISIS and won, but lost everything. All we did was for nothing, afterall the Kurds are still not recognised by the international community and we still have no protection,” Amina said. “Why don’t they try their own nationals, or come here and judge them themselves?” she asked.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hurrah heroic detectorists digging heritage","story":"Part of an Anglo-Saxon hoard found by Terry Herbert as he searched a field near his Staffordshire home with his trusty detector. Ring pull, Coke can, house keys… jackpot! All over Britain, in bogs and back gardens, from Hadrian’s Wall to Rochester Castle, amateur archaeologists are unearthing our island’s ancient Roman past. For every damp squib of a KitKat wrapper there’s always the chance that the insistent beep-beep-beep of the metal detector will reveal the whereabouts of a lost Carausian hoard. Best of all, you get to hang on to the loot. According to the Treasure Act of 1996, it’s (mostly) finders keepers. Which would be Gollum-ish and miserlyif detectorists weren’t such a sharing bunch.Since 1997, more than 1.48million artefacts have been voluntarily declared to the Portable Antiquities Scheme database. A new book, 50 Roman Finds from the Portable Antiquities Scheme collects some of the best, from a bearded bronze bust of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius to the Crosby Garrett cavalry helmet found by an unnamed man – or woman – in Cumbria. I like that “unnamed.” No fuss, no glory, just a cool £2.3million from the Christie’s auction house sale.While some detectorists may dream of finding the next Ilam pan or Saxon stash, others are just as content with their “grots” – tiny, worn-down Roman pennies. Off they go on wet weekends wielding metal sweepers with heroic names – Excalibur, Equinox, Sea Hunter (for smugglers’ chests and briny booty) – in the Micawberish hope that something, almost certainly, will turn up. All hail the happy amateurs!Does any other country on earth produce as many have-a-go-hoard-seekers as we do? Or, for that matter, as many twitchers, train-spotters, rare-books-dealers and collectors of stamps, matchbox cars and crinkly Queen’s Park Rangers programs from the sixties? (My husband’s eBay habit must be stopped).Here, in the Treasure Act, is a rare, pleasing coincidence of eccentric national temperament and indulgent, oh-go-on-then legislation. In an age otherwise cursed by pettifogging, form-filling, license-levying and general computer-says-no-can’t-do-ism, it’s cheering to think that in the unlikely event that you do stub your toe on a life-size bronze Caesar somewhere beyond the compost heap… it’s yours.It\u0027s Radio 3 for meOn Sunday afternoons, as the light fades and the detectorist turns to his Thermos of tea, I turn on The Listening Service. And there is lovely Tom Service giving a very short introduction to Christmas songs, or backing vocals, or bagpipes, or the clacking castanets of Spain.After Tom, comes Words and Music with its mix-tape of Bowie and Baudelaire, Mozart and Larkin. It’s no surprise to me that Radio 3 is soaring like Vaughan Williams\u0027 Lark Ascending. In the last quarter, 2.13million listeners a week have tuned in to Radio 3, up 16 per cent.I can’t remember exactly what did it – political tooth-pulling on the Today program, the blouse-rending miserabilists of Woman’s Hour, a tea-time serial on the crisis of children in care? – but some time last year I rolled the dial from 4 to 3, where they were playing music inspired by children’s games: Debussy’s Toy Box, Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker, Satie’s Jack-in-the-Box. Bliss!Brexit or Beethoven? Grenfell or Grieg? Trump or Haydn’s Trumpet Concerto in E-flat major?

I mean, very basic. I’ve driven a fair few in my time – and this year will be sampling many more. This is a bit of what I’ve learned, imperfectly, thus far.\u0026nbspIt is not, for these purposes, a “hybrid”, like the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbspor any other vehicle that also has an internal combustion engine on board (with one of two very particular exceptions).\u0026nbspAn electric car is a pure thing – it runs completely and solely on its batteries. When they run out, you stop moving.\u0026nbspI like to think of it as a cross between a washing machine, a laptop and,\u0026nbsperm, a car. So, your car is driven entirely by electric power – powerful lithium-ion batteries (like in your laptop) sending electricity to an electric motor (like your washing machine) which drives the road wheels (like on your motor car).\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, London210 Prince of Wales Drive, Battersea, LondonThe electricity stored in the batteries mostly comes from being plugged into the mains (there are various charging options, most commonly a fast charger attached to the side of your home, if you have the space). Some will be regenerated from the car itself, saving power otherwise wasted when braking, for example.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp2 Don’t some electric cars run on hydrogen?Yes, but they are not much more than prototypes, with only a handful of filling stations currently. Critics say using a hydrogen fuel cell to generate the electricity for the batteries simply adds an additional stage of energy accumulation and the manufacture of the hydrogen could be problematic, if it requires a disproportionate amount of non-renewable electricity.\u0026nbsp3 How far will one go on a charge?Well, that depends, but you can count on a modern mainstream electric car these days to bae able to take you 200 to 250 miles (conservatively) on a single charge – a\u0026nbspKia\u0026nbspe-Niro, say, or Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric. In the right hands, 300 miles might be possible. This, by the way is two or three times the usual range you’d experience a few years ago.\u0026nbspFeeling the spark: Drivers learning to love electric carsThe most advanced models, such as the famous Tesla range, will go on and on for near enough 400 miles. Some of the smaller more urban-oriented models, such as the new electric Smart cars will be good for about 100 miles.\u0026nbspThe rest is down to how you drive and when. Winter means the batteries tend to run down faster and you’ll likely get a shorter range.\u0026nbspIf you drive hard and fast you’ll use up more energy than otherwise, just like in a petrol or diesel car. Over along time the ability of the batteries to take and store a charge will deteriorate (just like your smartphone or laptop).Yes. To buy or lease you’re looking at a premium of some thousands of pounds. So, let’s take an example, the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona, a compact\u0026nbspSUV.\u0026nbsp With a conventional petrol engine you can pick one up at a list price of £17,505. For the hybrid version (petrol plus electric power generated on-board) you’ll need to fork out £22,495. For the\u0026nbspBEV\u0026nbspHyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectric, the price jumps to £35,100, or £32,600 when you take into account the government grant for electric cars of up to £3,500. \u0026nbspAgainst the usually higher purchase price or monthly PCP or lease fee you need to balance the savings you make compared t petrol or diesel: far cheaper fuel spending on your electricity tariff) lower running costs (fewer moving mechanical parts and consumables eg exhaust pipe, alternator, engine) and a range of lower taxes and congest and parking charges. Electric cars are exempt from road tax, carry lower benefit-in-kind tax liabilities for commercial users, usually form congestion charges and city bans, and can enjoy cheaper parking. There’s also a government subsidy of up to £500 for a home charger.\u0026nbspWhy have electric cars failed to spark with consumers? Has Tesla hastened the death of Britain’s electric car revolution?Grant Shapps’ plan for electric cars will make China a motoring giantWhether this makes financial sense really depends your pattern of car usage – the number of miles you do a year, and the type of journeys. With a lot of medium range commuting for example (say 60 miles a day) an electric car could pay for itself within a few years for sustained long-distance travelling then a diesel might make more sense.5 What are the advantages of an electric car?Apart from the financial ones it is of course far better for the environment. There are many debates about, say, the cost (in environmental terms) of mining rare minerals for the batteries, or transporting them vast distances to factories, or the energy used in making them. Also obviously an electric car that runs on electricity generated from soar power is better than one where the electricity happens to be generated by burning coal (ins or far as anyone can know this when they plug in).\u0026nbspHowever a reasonable assumption is that all electric cars are greener than any internal combustion engined equivalent, and that any public transport (rail or bus) is usually greener than any private alternative.Don’t forget that electric cars are very refined – being almost silent at any speed, and the acceleration form rest is startlingly fast, though they tend to run out of puff as they approach their top speeds. In other words they can be good to drive and to be driven in.6 What are the disadvantages?Surprisingly few, though it does depend on your circumstances. If you live in a flat or a terraced house, charging from home is obviously impossible or difficult, and the ease of use of an electric vehicle is much reduced. If you imagine that you’ll have to do journeys of more than 400 miles without warning, then an internal combustion engine is a surer way of getting wherever it is you might conceivably wish to go – though you’d need to take a break anyway.\u0026nbspIt’s fair to add that some of the public charging infrastructure leaves a bit to be desired – it could usefully be much bigger, more reliable and easier to use.And of course you do need to balance the financial sums against the clear practical and environmental plusses of being a green driver.\u0026nbsp7 Don’t they take ages to charge?Yes and no. The Tesla is an exception, in many ways, because it has a dedicated network of ultra-fast chargers, as well as being chargeable at home.\u0026nbspMost owners of electric cars have to rely on charging at home – but don’t\u0026nbsp have much trouble charging because they most likely have a home charging point, which does mean off-street parking for the moment. If you take a mainstream option like the Hyundai\u0026nbspKona\u0026nbspelectricity home, using a regular\u0026nbsp7kW\u0026nbspcharging point via its own cable a near-full zero to 80 per cent charge takes around 9 hours.A similar charge with a rapid charger (such as you’d fine at, say, motorway services)\u0026nbsptakes around an hour and a quarter. 75 minutes.\u0026nbspIn an emergency, you can also use a domestic three-pin charging lead, plugged into the mains at home like you’d plug in a kettle. However you’d looking at about 24 hours for a full charge – because the batteries are so big and the trickle form the domestic system so modest.\u0026nbsp8 Will they get easier to charge and go further in future?Yes. Much of the progress in the usefulness of the electric car is coming from improvements in battery “density” – the amount of useful power that can be stored in a an ever-more compact way.The battery pack is usually stored lower in the car, under the floor or the seats, and this can help with keeping the car stable (lower centre of gravity). Given that these units can grow very hot and need ventilation or water cooling for example, and have to be protected from water ingress (if fording a stream say, or just in a heavy downpour) , the progress in engineering in this field is truly impressive.\u0026nbspHowever, eventually the rate of improvement in range and efficiency will slow, and that might well mark an optimal moment to make a purchase or take on an electric car lease. But we cannot know when this will happen.9 What about hybrids?Well, what about hybrids? They are not electric cars. This is because they are, as the name implies, hybrids – a cross between an electric car and a traditional one powered by a petrol or diesel engine. Thus well-known hybrid models such as the Toyota\u0026nbspPrius\u0026nbsphave an internal combustion engine on board, as well as an electric motor and some batteries to boost performance and economy.\u0026nbspIn a hybrid the electric power is “self-generated”, which is to say that it comes from the engine regenerating and recycling power that might otherwise be wasted. So for example some of the power usually lost in heavy braking is instead sent back via the electric motor working “backwards” to the batteries, where it is stored for later use.\u0026nbspI drove 300 miles in an electric car and here’s what happenedMost hybrids pair an electric and a petrol engine because the two units tend to complement each other in use diesel-electric hybrids are rarer. “Mild” hybrids are just that – they have only a small ethic motor and minimal battery storage just to give a slight edge to reduce emissions and improve economy. The green advantage is quite marginal.\u0026nbspPlug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have the additional option of charging from the mains, as with an electric car, but it is not necessary to do so.\u0026nbspThe drawback with the hybrid technology is the constant trade-offs that have to made between the energy saved through the battery-electric motor system, set against the additional weight of them, which of course tends to raise fuel consumption. Clever software can minimise these trade-offs to more acceptable levels, but they will always be there, as compared to a\u0026nbspBEV. Hybrids, indeed, in their complexity and weight, can represent the e worst of both worlds.\u0026nbsp10 Aren’t electric cars all a bit oddball?They have been, yes, but the next few months year will see the launch of some very well-known models with full-electric versions.\u0026nbsp These will include: the Vauxhall\u0026nbspCorsa-e Peugeot 208 electric Volvo\u0026nbspXC40\u0026nbspRecharge and the Mini electric. They join an already quiet impressive variety of electric cars on sale or soon to go on sale.From the tiny\u0026nbspSkoda\u0026nbspCiti GOe-iV\u0026nbspand Smart EQ through the Renault Zoe to the Nissan leaf to MG ZS and the Jaguar\u0026nbspiPace\u0026nbspthere are already options to match your tastes and budget. And there is also a small market in used models such as the Renault\u0026nbspFluence, Mitsubishi\u0026nbspIMEV, Vauxhall\u0026nbspAmpera\u0026nbspor first generation Nissan Leaf that might also suit.These cars will tend to have shorter ranges, though, while older Renaults may still have their batteries on monthly lease from the company. As always – do your own research, but you can approach an electric car with more positivity than ever before.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s almost one a week. Let that sink in for a moment.It wasn’t done intentionally – but, perhaps even worse, completely obliviously. Every other weekend, off I trotted, to Moscow, Doha, Rome and the rest, usually for no more than a weekend at a time. I could say that I excused my high flying lifestyle – pun very much intended – by arguing that it was all for work. With the best will in the world, being a travel journalist was always going to involve a certain amount of travel.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, sadly, that would be giving me way too much credit. The truth is, I didn’t excuse it at all. It never even crossed my mind that I needed to.\u0026nbspUntil, of course, a previously unimaginable and unprecedented shift in the public perception of flying started to emerge. The first time I really realised that a sea change was coming was Emma Thompson’s much-publicised fall from grace, when she flew 5,400 miles from LA to London in the spring to participate in the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations that were bringing the capital to a standstill. The actor and activist was pilloried by the Right and Left in equal measure (the former labelling her a hypocrite, the latter asserting they didn’t need her carbon-tainted help, thank you very much).Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

What was the big deal? She was using her platform to add clout to a much-needed protest demanding action on the coming climate crisis. Surely that was a good thing?It wasn’t long afterwards that I heard of the flygskam (flight shame) and tågskryt (train brag) movements for the first time. Originating in Sweden and publicised by high-profile figures including Olympic athlete Bjorn Ferry and opera singer Malena Ernman, mother of teenage activist Greta Thunberg, the idea was to make the notion of flying something a little unsavoury – something you might not want to admit to doing in polite company. On the flip side, the “train brag” movement is all about celebrating rail travel, with participants posting pictures and videos of their beauty-filled overland journeys on social media.Meet the people who’ve given up flyingThe concept has even made its way over the North Sea, as I discovered when I came across the Flight Free UK movement. Founder Anna Hughes’ original aim was to get 100,000 people to sign up and pledge to stay grounded for a whole year.\u0026nbsp“I haven’t flown for about 10 years,” she said, “but given the situation we’re now in, I felt like it wasn’t enough to reduce my own carbon footprint – I needed to open it up and do more. And it took over my life!”I didn’t really expect to be joining the swelling ranks of do-gooders, to be perfectly honest. As journalists, we can easily become accomplished fantasists, convincing ourselves that we are somehow set apart from reality – here to observe and report, rather than participate.But something changed in me after I spoke to Anna, along with a number of other committed non-flyers. They were, to a fault, impassioned and persuasive yet polite and non-judgemental. They were happy to take on huge personal expense and inconvenience, all in the hopes that it might help save the only habitable planet we’ve got. A seed was planted in my brain which grew – slowly but unstoppably – day by day, and has already led to me significantly cutting down on the number\u0026nbspof flights I took in the latter half of 2019.Now, it’s time to take the next step: a year of keeping both feet on the ground. Far from being some po-faced exercise in restraint, more than anything I hope this experience will prove that travel, in all its adventurous, erse and mind-opening glory, is not only possible with clipped wings, but can even be enhanced by taking it slow.I produced somewhere in the region of 6,000kg of CO2 from flying in 2019. Here’s to it being 0kg in 2020.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While the details are sparse in terms of sources and specific tactics, there are some startling revelations, including how Gwyneth Paltrow became a helping hand and the extreme lengths Weinstein’s team went to in order to thwart both reporters and silence the alleged victims. (OP)Future Sex is perhaps one of the few nonfiction books about sex and relationships that came before #MeToo and somehow remains relevant today. Finding herself suddenly single at the age of 30, Witt immerses herself in the sexual subcultures of San Francisco, trying her hand at everything from polyamory to orgasmic meditation. It’s a fascinating piece of work, one that illustrates Witt’s talents as an essayist and gives plenty of room to many astute observations on sexual liberation. (OP)Every now and then a book comes along that tilts your perspective on the world. This internationally best-selling phenomenon is one of them. Covering just about the entire sweep of human history, it makes you understand the fits, starts and savagery of progress. (CR)The Girls is about exploring the appeal of being in a cult. Inspired by Charles Manson’s murderous “family”, the book serves up a more tense, richer depiction than Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, one that puts women at the centre, examining what motivates and captivates them. (OP)840 Marlon James: A Brief History of Seven Killings (2014)The Booker-winning A Brief History of Seven Killings, by Jamaican-born Marlon James, follows the lives and deaths of seven of the would-be killers in the failed 1976 assassination attempt on Bob Marley. The novel cleverly weaves fiction and fact – and the language has a musical rhythm. Some of the epiphanies in the book are linked to songs. (MC)Terminal illness and bankruptcy shouldn’t make for an inspiring read but they somehow do in Raynor Winn’s poetic, provocative memoir. After losing the family home, Win and her husband set out to walk the South West Coast path, shaking a fist at his grim diagnosis. It’s as much a meditation on the power of nature as 1040 Nina Stibbe – Love, Nina: Despatches from Family Life (2013)There’s deadpan and then there’s Nina Stibbe, who proves herself the heir to Adrian Mole in this novel written in the form of letters to her sister from a child-minding job in London. A provincial girl grappling with the strange salads of the metropolitan literary elite, Stibbe is comic gold. (CR) The assassins Eli and Charlie Sisters were played by John C Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix in the film version of Canadian-born writer Patrick deWitt’s second novel. The narrator Eli captures the lawless, unpredictable nature of frontier life in the mid-19th century. The Sisters Brothers is a compelling, unsettling tale of the Gold Rush era. (MC)Every office has its misfit, and this is the funny, deeply touching story of a woman whose aversion to social niceties and the work Christmas lunch hides a traumatic past. Common acts of kindness rekindle the protagonist in this beautifully told debut.

(OP)1540 Anne Tyler – A Spool of Blue Thread (2015)Anne Tyler is a master of stories about family life in middle-class America. A Spool of Blue Thread, the 20th novel from the author of The Accidental Tourist, adroitly shines a light on sibling rivalry, family secrets and the wounding power of grief. Her tale of four generations of the Whitshanks demonstrates again her gift for comic detail. (MC)The Green Road, by Dublin-born Anne Enright, is set in County Clare, a wild place geographically and emotionally. Enright’s keen gift for observation is at play in this family saga based around Hanna, Dan, Constance and Emmet’s Christmas return to the home that their scary matriarch, Rosaleen, is selling. A funny, painful tale of selfishness and compassion. (MC)1740 Amor Towles – A Gentleman in Moscow (2016)The gentleman in question is Count Rostov, a bon vivant and aristocrat placed under house arrest in a fancy Moscow hotel after the communists seize control. His wit and enduring humanity make this charming, quirky novel sing. (CR)When fact meets fiction, the result is almost always fascinating as the reader spends hours trying to discern which is which. Such is the appeal of The Idiot, Elif Batuman’s debut novel, which tells the semi-autobiographical tale of a young woman studying at Harvard in the mid-Nineties. After pontificating on the purpose of email, she soon becomes obsessed with an enigmatic Hungarian student whose insouciance will leave you spinning in a state of total frustration. (OP)Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk’s 10th novel was the short, stunning The Red-Haired Woman, which is at once a fable and a gripping tale of youthful obsession, exploring protagonist Cem Celik’s desire for the red-haired, enigmatic member of a theatre troupe.

(MC)A dazzling insight into the mind of one of The New Yorker’s most prolific writers, Ariel Levy’s memoir will seem relatable to all those who have at one time or another felt a startling sense of dissociation from their life, which is probably most of us. Levy’s personal tragedies will leave readers reeling. There is one passage in particular that will stay with you for months in which Levy describes how she suffered a miscarriage on a hotel room floor while on an assignment in Mongolia. She was 19 weeks pregnant at the time and her son, born alive, died in her arms. It is a story of resilience to the highest degree. (OP)Lila was the third novel in Marilynne Robinson’s Gilead Chronicles – following Gilead (2004) and Home (2008) – and tells, in unflinching terms, the story of Lila, the young woman who married the elderly Reverend Ames in a dusty Iowa town. Robinson writes beautifully and, as a sophisticated religious thinker, asks searching questions about faith and doubt. (MC)There are few writers as gloriously strange, acerbic, funny and faintly ruthless as Sedaris, who once again mines his family history in this collection of autobiographical short stories. It includes a tale in which he feeds his Both a love story and a look at how racial ides play out in the UK and the USA, Americanah is as enchanting as it is thought-provoking.

He is forced to face up to “the accumulation, the multiplication, of loss”. (MC)No matter how many documentaries you watch or books you read on Mormonism, it’s almost impossible to understand such a community from the outside. Tara Westover opened people’s eyes with Educated, explaining how she went from growing up in a Mormon fundamentalist family in Idaho to studying for a PhD at the University of Cambridge. It’s an inspiring story of grit and determination that doubles up as an homage to the power of self-education and, well, reading.

It subjects romantic love, pregnancy, motherhood and all the attendant tedious cultural baggage to an intensely intelligent, glittering critique. (CR)In Canada, retired English teacher Dell Parsons, the son of hapless bank robbers, looks back on the heart-breaking events of his teenage years and tries to “take account” of how his life was shaped.

(CR)Walter and Patty Berglund, the seemingly perfect couple who meet at college in the 1970s, are at the heart of Jonathan Franzen’s fourth novel. The story of their unravelling marriage is explored in a rich, nuanced novel. Freedom is more than just a tale of wedded unbliss: it is about the messiness of love and longing in the modern world. (MC)A sprawling, multi-generational tale of a Turkish family who make a new life in London, this novel has a so-called ‘honour killing’ as its centre of gravity. Shafak, a best-selling author in Turkey and many other countries, conjures up the hypocrisy that holds women to different standards, with devastating results. (CR) 3140 Helen Macdonald – H Is for Hawk (2016)When Helen Macdonald lost her father, she acquired a hawk. This idiosyncratic approach to grief makes for a lyrical, moving probe into both the process of mourning and our relationship with the natural world. (CR)Not just a novel but a fully fledged cultural phenomenon, the sequel to the Handmaid’s Tale was met with midnight readings and fans decked out in the creepy red and white gowns from the TV adaptation of the original.

(MC)3440 Matt Haig – Reasons to Stay Alive (2015)There’s a reason why Matt Haig’s writing on mental health has earned him such high praise, with the Duchess of Sussex among his fans. And it all started with this bestselling memoir in which the children’s fiction author describes falling into a deep depression in his early twenties that left him contemplating taking his own life. It’s not an easy read, but in a society where suicide remains grossly misunderstood and gender stereotypes hinder men from speaking openly about their mental wellbeing, it’s a crucial one. (OP) 3540 Arundhati Roy – The Ministry of Utmost Happiness (2017)Twenty years after her stunning debut The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy followed up with the mesmerising The Ministry of Utmost Happiness. With biting ironic wit, Roy’s epic dissects life in India in the wake of the partition conflict. The characters, including the transgender woman Anjum, are intimately drawn.

While Rooney has gone on to publish a second novel, Normal People, which was shortlisted for this year’s Man Booker Prize, Conversations with Friends remains her best work. With its snappy short sentences, sophisticated plot and characters so complex that it’s hard to like any of them, the novel established Rooney as one of the most exciting new writers around. (OP)3740 George Saunders – Lincoln in the Bardo (2017)Lincoln in the Bardo tells the story of a single night in the life of Abraham Lincoln – when his 11-year-old son was buried – through an experimental tale involving 166 narrators in the bardo, the transitional state between one’s death and rebirth, according to Tibetan Buddhism. George Saunders’ enchanting tour-de-force won the 2017 Man Booker Prize. (MC)In 2019, female desire warrants shrewd examination more than ever. Thank goodness, then, for Lisa Taddeo, who spent eight years documenting the sexual experiences of three very relatable but very different women. The result is a powerful collection of interspersed narratives that probe the most intimate corners of the female psyche. I can think of nothing like it. (OP)An outrageous satire of contemporary race relations, Beatty’s The Sellout tells the story of a black man called Bonbon who is seeking to reinstitute slavery and segregation. When it won the Booker, the chair of the judges compared Beatty to Swift and Twain. (CR)4040 . Hilary Mantel –  Bring Up the Bodies (2012)The sequel to Mantel’s Booker-winning Tudor tour de force, Wolf Hall, Bring up the Bodies did not Let Down the Readers. Her immersive prose takes us back into the poetic, rigorous mind of the archetypal career politician, Thomas Cromwell. The subject is the stuff of school days – Henry Tudor’s marriage to Anne Boleyn, and her fatal failure to produce a male heir. To allow another marriage and safeguard the stability of the country, Cromwell engineers Boleyn’s downfall, constructing capital charges against the queen along with a few of his old enemies to boot.

Expectations about the economy were reflected in real household spending per person, which grew at its slowest annualised rate since the end of 2016. On average, people spent less on cars in over the period than they did in 2016, with spending on recreation and culture, and utilities growing more slowly over the same time.“This is the first time that ratings of life satisfaction significantly fell,” ONS researchers said. “It is the first significant change since early 2015 in what was a stable picture of life satisfaction in the UK.“After this period, average life satisfaction ratings reached a plateau, with fluctuations quarter on quarter but no significant changes up to their deterioration in the latest quarter.”Prioritise citizens’ wellbeing over GDP in budgets, Iceland PM urgesMeanwhile figures from the organisation for Economic Cooperation and development showed that the UK was the only member of the Group of 7 (G7) rich nations to suffer a fall in people’s average income.The OECD, known as the rich countries’ think tank, said real household income per capita contracted significantly in the third quarter of 2019, by minus 0.7 per cent, unwinding much of the 0.9 per cent growth recorded in the previous three months.Households income per person grew by 1.5 per cent during the two years to September 2019, just half the average of 3.0 per cent for the G7 as whole.A barometer of consumer confidence among British consumers also fell in October. However, the January reading by GfK’s long-running Consumer Confidence Index increased two points to minus nine for January adding to evidence to an upturn in spirits decision the General Election.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Expectations about the economy were reflected in real household spending per person, which grew at its slowest annualised rate since the end of 2016. On average, people spent less on cars in over the period than they did in 2016, with spending on recreation and culture, and utilities growing more slowly over the same time.“This is the first time that ratings of life satisfaction significantly fell,” ONS researchers said. “It is the first significant change since early 2015 in what was a stable picture of life satisfaction in the UK.“After this period, average life satisfaction ratings reached a plateau, with fluctuations quarter on quarter but no significant changes up to their deterioration in the latest quarter.”Prioritise citizens’ wellbeing over GDP in budgets, Iceland PM urgesMeanwhile figures from the organisation for Economic Cooperation and development showed that the UK was the only member of the Group of 7 (G7) rich nations to suffer a fall in people’s average income.The OECD, known as the rich countries’ think tank, said real household income per capita contracted significantly in the third quarter of 2019, by minus 0.7 per cent, unwinding much of the 0.9 per cent growth recorded in the previous three months.Households income per person grew by 1.5 per cent during the two years to September 2019, just half the average of 3.0 per cent for the G7 as whole.A barometer of consumer confidence among British consumers also fell in October. However, the January reading by GfK’s long-running Consumer Confidence Index increased two points to minus nine for January adding to evidence to an upturn in spirits decision the General Election.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now is the crucial moment when so many young people are thinking about their options for September.\u0026nbsp“I recognise it can be challenging, particularly when schools have their own post-16 offer. But we all have a responsibility to support young people to make choices based on their skills, interests and aspirations.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Seven more courses will be on offer from 2021 and the remaining 15 will be launched in 2022 and 2023.Lord Agnew said: “T-levels are launching in September this year, offering high-quality technical alternatives to A-levels. It is more important than ever that headteachers give their pupils the chance to talk with providers so they are able to work out whether a technical education might be right for them.“We have a responsibility to make sure that young people are able to make informed choices based on their aptitudes and ambitions. This will give them the chance to realise their full potential.”David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges (AoC), said: “At its heart it is simply unfair of schools not to positively promote and explain the full range of options.\u0026nbsp“I hope, therefore, that this nudge from Lord Agnew makes a marked difference, but would encourage the government to think about further measures to make sure that it does.”\u0026nbspDepartment for Education\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Its 2020 and everyone including Emma has woken up from their nap!!!”Another pleaded: “Don’t play with my feelings like this”.The suspicion that Friends might return to screens began last October when Jennifer Aniston Instagrammed a photo with the rest of her costars enjoying a reunion dinner.Later in the month, Aniston explained on The Ellen Show that she was “working on something” with her former Friends cast members.Then in December, Aniston stoked up yet more speculation after insisting to People magazine that though she knows “nothing” about the production of a reboot, she and the rest of the cast are trying to make it happen: “And I will just continue with… we’re trying.”The actor continued: “It’s a never-ending question, isn’t it? What else could make a group of six actors feel more proud?”“It’s bringing people joy on a daily basis.”Matthew Perry recently\u0026nbspbecame the final Friend star to join Instagram.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

From there, you\u0027ll see the normal list of everyone you follow, but also the new update.There is an option for looking at the Instagram accounts that appear most in your feed. Those are also likely to be the ones you interact with most, given that Instagram prizes things like likes when deciding what to show, but could also be annoying accounts that post too much.The other option shows users who they interact with least. That can include dozens of people that might be worth unfollowing if their feed or stories are becoming overwhelming.The new feature was found in testing late last year, but has finally rolled out to everyone with a new update and announcement from Instagram.It comes after the app also added the option to see the people you follow sorted by how recently you started doing so. That is similarly intended to allow people to better understand their feed, and get rid of anyone they followed a long time ago but no longer wish to see posts from.Selena Gomez says Instagram is ‘destroying’ some of her generationAll of the features are intended to allow people to have more control of their news feed and hopefully better curate what they want to see.“Instagram is really about bringing you closer to the people and things you care about — but we know that over time, your interests and relationships can evolve and change,” a spokesperson said.“Whether you graduate, move to a new city, or become obsessed with a new interest and find a community, we want to make it easier to manage the accounts you follow on Instagram so that they best represent your current connections and interests.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also attempts magic as Laurie Davidson’s Mr Mistoffelees.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast year, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker beat Cats at the box office, with Cats grossing £5m on its opening weekend, compared to The Rise of Skywalker’s £135.5m.Created with Sketch.19 films to look out for in 2020 Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)An intoxicating and romantic drama about lovers on the run, Queen \u0026amp Slim marks the first feature film from Melina Matsoukas, the director responsible for music videos including Beyoncé’s “Formation”. Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series.

The moon will appear full for around three days, ning from Saturday to Monday.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe time of year means this full moon has traditionally been known as the Full Snow Moon or the Full Hunger Moon, as it often coincided with heavy snowfall and difficult hunting conditions.The arrival of\u0026nbspStorm Ciara\u0026nbspmay affect viewing conditions for people in the UK, with the Met Office forecasting cloud and rain across most of the country on Sunday morning.Created with Sketch.Super worm moon - last supermoon of 2019 in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Worm moon rises over the Karancs Hills in HungaryWorm moon over the Empire State Building in New YorkWorm moon rises over the Galicia Massif mountains in SpainWorm moon rises over the Santiago de Compostela cathedral in Galicia, SpainWorm moon rises over silhouettes of the Beatles in LiverpoolWorm moon over the Guggenheim Museum in Bibao, SpainWorm moon rises over the Karancs Hills in HungaryWorm moon over the Empire State Building in New YorkWorm moon rises over the Galicia Massif mountains in SpainWorm moon rises over the Santiago de Compostela cathedral in Galicia, SpainWorm moon rises over silhouettes of the Beatles in LiverpoolWorm moon over the Guggenheim Museum in Bibao, SpainFortunately, it will not be long to wait until the next supermoon.

That’s my question to you.”“It all just went right down the toilet, is where it went,” she said.\u0026nbspAs the exchange continues, Ms Heever says that she’ll get clarification on the rules for rescinding a vote, but tries one last argument, appealing to her own Christian faith to try to convince the voter.\u0026nbspUnfortunately for Ms Heever, the woman shrugs the argument off, instead suggesting that Ms Heever’s acceptance of Mr Buttigieg means she must not believe in what the Bible says. The voter asks why Mr Buttigieg’s sexual orientation wasn’t more widely known, which Ms Heever correctly points out is “common knowledge.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Look out for that.”So I did, but still can’t isolate the exact moment it arrived at last week’s National Television Awards, on ITV, where the industry had assembled for the th time and, quite possibly, the last as well.If it was the NTA’s farewell, then it’d be a mercy ­killing for an event where shock results have come along about as regularly as Hezbollah ­isions have arrived at the Changing of the Guard.Five years ago, you could’ve bet the house Ant and Dec would claim their th presenting title, and This ­Morning’s Phillip and Holly would milk their tenth consecutive Best Magazine Show hangover, to the point their long-suffering audience were probably feeling homicidal.This year’s only vague surprise being, it transpired, Ant and Dec thought the same way as the viewers, with Dec admitting they: “Feel more and more sick every year.”There was a flip side to all these set-in-stone voting patterns, of course.The NTAs remained the one place on ­television earth where Mrs Brown’s Boys could be relied upon to beat the massively overrated Fleabag.Considering how regimented the actual voting is, though, the far more remarkable thing about the NTAs is that it’s nearly always a shambolic production.Categories come, go, mutate and ide into three drama sections .Some are accompanied by clips . Others, like New Drama, aren’t. It also whores itself out commercially and jumps on every available bandwagon.So David Mitchell trudged on randomly, dressed as Shakespeare, to promote a stage show, and the Impact Award was given to Gavin  Stacey, when it had “Caroline Flack’s bedside lamp” written all over it.A lot of this was down to the fact the NTAs still don’t know their own mind.They want to be both popular and highbrow, which meant poor old Michael Palin was left describing it as “a hotbed of talent”, while the camera went looking for Tess Daly.Through it all , Ant, Dec and This Morning have endured, and it’s possible to have a bit of sympathy for the production, with such stubbornly repetitive voting habits.The NTAs and ITV really are the authors of most of their own misfortune here, though.Insecure television networks need a Best Magazine category, TV awards don’t.Nor do they need a Best Judge, which was the section that eventually lumbered them with four-times winner David Walliams, the trouserless host — a man whose world begins and ends with himself and, when required to do something , like pay tribute to Nicholas Parsons, performs it with all the sincerity of a “mind the gap” announcement.As luck would have it, however, two very obvious solutions to the hosting problem presented themselves in the audience, on Tuesday.One was Ricky Gervais, who probably wouldn’t do it.The other, in about row , was Bradley Walsh, who stole the entire show by virtue of winning and saying nothing, but pulling all the right faces.Bradley would be the most obvious fit in the event’s history and I’m sure it would be warmly welcomed by most people,only the National Television Awards were worth saving.THREE and a half meandering years it took us to reach Friday night’s pm Brexit countdown.Yet in all that time I can’t remember one occasion when British TV’s satirical shows actually had something laugh-out-loud funny to say on the subject.That’s almost certainly because Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order all decided their left-of-centre anti-Brexit opinion was far more important than mere comedy.The wonderful irony is that the collective fury and bile has definitely had an effect.It’s made a minor star out of Geoff Norcott, one of those very rare comedians who’s not just a Conservative Leaver, he’s actually likeable as well.As the token voice of Brexit, Channel  and the BBC, very grudgingly, have had to include Geoff on almost every comedy show, including The Last Leg: Countdown To Brexit, where they’ve been trying and failing to screw a laugh out of Adam Hills’ beard for months now.I gave up on the latest attempt after about half an hour, which meant I was still looking for a show to make sense of Britain’s relationship with Europe and had only two reasonable options available, as the clock ticked down to pm.One was calm, sober analysis from the BBC, the other was ITV+’s screening of Love Island.Obviously, I took the more credible option and discovered men in lederhosen were flinging jugs of beer at scantily clad Frauleins while the commentator explained: “We sent a runner to buy strap-on harnesses and stuff poles on them.“The girls’ job is to toss pretzels at the boys and the couple with the least amount of pretzels on their pole at the end is out.”MAN Like Mobeen Man don’t like Mobeen.THE dressing-up box brigade lulled me into a  sense of security, at Sunday night’s Baftas, on BBC.True, host Graham Norton made sure there was an undercurrent of hostility to “white men” , from the start, and there was all the usual self-aggrandising flannel about “giving a voice to the voiceless”.But Andy “Gollum” Serkis made a two-minute -second speech, accepting his Outstanding Contribution award, that was so beautully judged it seemed to pacy them for nearly an hour and a half.Then Rebel Wilsonjoked that it was only sexism that stopped her joining Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes in the Best Director category and it was like she’d flipped a switch on the entire room.Suddenly, Joaquin Phoenix was agonising about “systemic racism” and Prince William was lecturing everyone about “ersity” without the entire Royal Albert Hall gasping at his brass neck.Then, just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, up popped Hugh Grant to announce he was so impressed with the Best Film contenders His Lordship had actually condescended to vote for one of them, which I’m assuming lost.For a couple of seconds at least, though, it really was possible to think, “Maybe the National TV Awards weren’t so bad, after all.”WINTERWATCH, prediction of the week, Iolo Williams to Chris Packham: “In ten years’ time, we’ll probably have penduline tits.”Arthritic groins, Spacehopper-sized prostates and chronic flatulence.Further to last week’s allegations, Good Morning Britain weather girl Laura Tobin says: “I do not crave attention. I like to have attention for my work, good climate change stories and Nasa trips.”As I noticed myself, when I saw Laura appear in Tipping Point: Lucky Stars, Drive, with Vernon Kay, Pointless Celebrities and Sharknado : Global Swarming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their extreme version of Islam legitimises slaughtering innocent people.Anyone  randomly stabbing ­passers-by or encouraging it would probably be classed as insane and locked away forever.

What is the future of the BBC  Should China build our telecoms network Seldom has the political news agenda been so packed. But what is the story gaining traction at Westminster  For the latest, let’s go straight to our correspondent outside  Downing Street - who, oh dear, is stomping away in protest like Dick Emery’s Honky Tonks, having just had a blazing row with Boris Johnson’s media strategist.Yes, the big story, crazily, is the stand-off between political journalists and the PM’s media advisers. The reporters, hardly the most delicate bunch of dahlias, are wailing that the Government is being beastly to them.In the blue corner we have Downing Street’s press officers who, in an unusual interpretation of the Trade Description Act, are refusing to speak to the Press. When newspapers write about themselves, readers are entitled to roll their eyes.Political news, like the mass-production of pork bangers, is a manufacturing process best conducted away from the view of consumers. Not unless you want to turn the whole country vegan.I’ve been in newspapers since the mid-s, much of the time at Westminster, and have met drunkards, liars, gropers, cheats — and that was just the religious-affairs writers. Don’t let’s pretend journalism or politics attracts innocent hayseeds. Which makes the over-reacting on both sides of the ide in recent days so ridiculous.Creative tension between reporters and politicians’ media handlers is a healthy thing, but the system has suddenly snapped. This follows a general election in which it sometimes felt as though the media, particularly broadcasters, niggled Boris Johnson more effectively than Jeremy Corbyn did.When Boris won a thumping majority, his aides may have thought: “Right, now we can exact revenge on our media tormentors.” If so, they are foolish and unprofessional.First, they started mucking about with the daily briefings to the Westminster press lobby, the club of accredited journalists who report on politics.Then, on Monday, they tried to bar some members of that lobby from a briefing by David Frost, Boris’s main adviser on the European trade negotiations. Some scribes were told they could attend, others were told they were barred.Downing Street claimed that the briefing was too specialised for general politics writers to appreciate. The reporters took a dferent view.They reckoned Downing Street strategist Dominic Cummings and his sidekick Lee Cain were trying to ide and rule, and to winnow out the journalistic troublemakers. In a rare moment of solidarity among hacks, the newshounds upped and left. Walkout!This squabble is now headline news. Urgent questions were raised in the Commons and many papers and broadcasters are protesting that the Government is trying to censor the free Press in a “sinister” way.They compare this tactic to Donald Trump’s denunciation of mainstream US media for spreading “fake news” . Sir Keir Starmer, would-be leader of the Labour Party, joined the outcry, siding with the journalists. We could have done without that slippery little bit of opportunism.The same Starmer boasted recently that he would refuse to talk to reporters from The Sun, presumably because this paper is not in his pocket.Attempts to neutralise awkward reporters are not exactly new. During the  election, as a scurvy political sketch writer, I was locked out of a Tony Blair campaign event in The Wrekin.Gordon Brown’s people stopped me attending a media event with the president of South Africa.Tory party cronies barred me from witnessing a leadership debate between David Cameron and David Davis in . In the last election, non-sympathetic journalists were not given access to Jeremy Corbyn’s battle bus. Mind you, we were lucky. As one Leftie reporter told me: “You couldn’t get on Corbyn’s bus but I couldn’t get OFF it!”Despite some of those historic precedents, the current “lobby war” is more problematic because it looks more concerted and because it comes at a time when traditional news sources are under challenge from the internet.Online news sites can be shady and unreliable. Traditional lobby journalists, for all their faults, are at least reasonably accountable.Both sides should cool it. The lobby should admit that its clique is unacceptably clubby for st-century politics. And Boris’s henchmen should drop the macho posturing. Why are they picking this fight at a time when the Government is so popular  Never a better time for it, they might say. They want to show who’s boss.You could compare their aggression to that of an inmate who on arrival in prison butts the first guy he meets in order to show other prisoners he’s a tough guy. In my experience, journalists respond badly to this approach.Look at the damage Tony Blair’s thuggish spokesman Alastair Campbell did to the government he served.It is not beyond the wit of ministers to palm favourable stories to selected journaliststhey so wish. But the central media unit at No should remember — as they have repeatedly told us — that they are “the people’s Government” and not merely the servants of Boris Johnson.Their juicy salaries come from the taxpayer and the taxpayer does not expect them to abuse their privileged position.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is often hope where we may first see ­dficulty. You just have to look a bit harder sometimes.In Portpatrick, at Scotland’s bottom left corner, the harbour had fallen into miserable disrepair. A plan was hatched to stop the rot.A local hero organised a share issue for locals to raise the money to buy the harbour and restore the buildings around it. The village now has its pecker up again and the future looks bright.It’s a similar story on Anglesey. At Halen Mon a thriving family business draws water out of the Menai Strait, harvests the salt and sells it all over the world.Near there I met a woman called Sian Sykes who cared about those waters so much she paddle-boarded  miles around Anglesey picking out the plastic.Asthat wasn’t enough, she then paddled the whole coast of Wales doing exactly the same.But my favourite character round there is no longer with us. On the very western tip of Holy Island off Anglesey’s west coast, there is the South Stack lighthouse. It’s been saving sailors from watery deaths since .A hundred years ago, John Jones was its keeper and it was his great granddaughter Denise Shaw who took me up to the top of it.Denise showed me a photograph of her great-grandad sporting a magnicent moustache the seagulls must have coveted for their nests.He was no loner, though. Denise remembers her mum saying old great-gramps was a bit of a ladies’ man.And what a chat-up line he had at his disposal: “Do you want to come back to my place to see how bright my light is ”All four of the areas we’ve looked at for this series of Our Coast are around the Irish Sea. I had a brilliant time at Belfast docks where I joined the harbour pilots, whose work astounded me.It’s their job to bring the giant ships safely into port.I sort of assumed they did this by chugging out to meet them, lighting up a sign saying, “follow me” and gently leading them to their berths.Far from it. Round the clock, all year round, whatever the weather, they race out several miles to pull up alongside these huge vessels.Incredibly, a rope ladder is dropped over the side for the pilots to clamber aboard, make their way to the bridge, take over the controls and steer these monsters into tight spaces on the docks.The ship I boarded with them, somewhat terried, was carrying grain from Romania.As my man took the helm I asked the Polish skipper which country had the best harbour pilots. “You do,” he said, with feeling.Back across the Irish Sea, in Formby, north of Liverpool, I met Mike McComb in the £million place he’s built himself a stone’s throw from the sea.He has more bedrooms, bathrooms and children than I could count .His fortune could have bought him a lavish home anywhere in the world. But it was up here, along the endless beach, that back in the day he and his mates would come on their bikes from their tiny homes in Bootle.So, he tells me as we stand on the beach, lashed by rain and wind, you can keep St Tropez or Malibu. This coast, his coast, is where he’ll stay.The sea seems to be a magnet for the most memorable people, from Grace the crane engineer in Belfast Docks who played rugby for Ireland in three rugby world cups, to Sandy the tattooed pagan near Stranraer who says the sea’s our mother, and the Bulgarian dissident I chanced upon sitting in a hot tub ­surveying Liverpool from the deck of the Queen Mary .My grandad used to tell me that when you put your toe in the sea you’re connected with the whole world.With that in mind, I’ve enjoyed many a paddle this summer reflecting on the power and history of what our island nation is all about.And I urge you to do it, too. After all, it’s pretty easy. Britain’s most landlocked place — Coton in the Elms in Derbyshire — is just  miles from the coast. So none of us is more than a couple of hours away from the sea.There’s never been a more relevant time to get out to the edges and see the soul of this country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because very often it sure as hell ain’t the product.Last Saturday, the most read piece on the BBC news homepage was a clickbait “story” — taken from Twitter — about how Kim Kardashian eats chicken nuggets.Yes, you read that right. With £.billion of your money to its name, one of the most popular “stories” on the BBC’s news website was an item which didn’t cost a penny to make, wasn’t news and stretched the definition of “public service” far beyond breaking point. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.James Purnell — a particularly puffed-up BBC exec — announced  months ago that he and his Radio  Education team would be expanding into podcasts. He stayed horribly true to his word.In , Auntie produces podcasts on everything from football and Love Island to what Towie star Gemma ­Collins’ latest musings are, which — thanks to the big names at the helm — are ­raking in listeners.For Purnell, this is something to be celebrated. Successful podcasts presumably mean more money in his already overstuffed pockets.But for the hundreds of private podcast makers out there, it spells the beginning of the end. Competing with a company which uses public funds to net the likes of Peter Crouch is nigh-on impossible.How, I ask you, can a state broadcaster justy putting hard-working private firms out of business Yes, Ollie Williams discussing his shock exit from the Love Island villamight be entertaining, but what ­“service” is it providing the public Can the BBC — which doesn’t make Love Island — really do a better job of a Love Island podcast than ITV, which does You’d think the BBC top dogs, who are desperate to cling on to the Royal Charter, would be asking these vital questions too.But in their desperate quest for “yoof” audiences, they’ve chucked their critical faculties out of the window.And it’s all for nothing. Because the quest is a wild goose chase. According to the latest Ofcom report, most kids don’t watch ANY linear TV.So the BBC is defending a dying, analogue means of ­communication. But no one in the corporation can bear to face this unwelcome reality.So instead of cutting their own whopping salaries, they scrap well-known and well- respected current affairs ­programmes such as the ­Victoria Derbyshire show.Why  Because the more ­visible the cut, the easier it is for luvvies to pretend that the BBC is the blameless ­victim of evil Tory austerity.Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth. In fact,anything, it is the Tories and their tens of ­millions of voters who are ­victims of the BBC.The repeated Horrible Histories ­“comedy” — which mockingly undermined the existence of “British things” — and the ­ludicrously PC recent East-Enders storyline, in which a deranged killer embraces Islam and becomes a hero, are the latest in a long line of ultra- liberal BBC content seemingly designed to rub ordinary, ­patriotic Brits up the wrong way.Things can’t go on like this. If the state broadcaster is to survive, there must be an urgent and fundamental rethink.First, the BBC’s parasitical website must be shut down. The stories it features are mostly dross, or  adapted from newspaper reports.To list just one example, when Brits want to know what’s happening with Megxit, they can buy The Sun — which was responsible for the scoop in the first place.If the BBC wants a web presencethey can use it to broadcast News . Next, the salaries of fat cat managers and C-list celebs must be slashed.Then the corporation must think hard about its media offering. BBC and its often extremely niche arts offering should be folded into BBC.Radio  and , with content already well covered by ­commercial markets, must be shut down. As must every ­programme across BBC ­channels which is designed to damage ITV’s ­ratings.And of course Brits should not be punished for refusing to pay a licence fee for a service they may not use.Decriminalising it — as Boris Johnson is understood to be seriously ­considering — is the right thing to do.If Auntie can swallow a big slice of humble pie, accept her glory days are over and slim right down to size, she may have a future.

Aspiring politician Shaun also told how he felt unable to tell Mackay to leave him alone because of his high profile in the SNP. On one occasion, the MSP wrote: “Would you like to come stay with me sometime ” The last message he sent was on Sunday. He told Shaun he was “finishing the budget papers” but was free to see him in the city. Shaun said Mackay, , asked himwas gay. Despite Shaun telling him he was straight and in a long-term relationship, the politician continued to insist they meet.  After Shaun got married last May, Mackay told him he looked “loved up” but continued to contact him. Shaun said he felt “pressurised” to respond to Mackay due to his standing in the party – otherwise he would have told him to “f-off”. He called him a “predator” who didn’t “take the hint” despite repeated demurrals. Mackay resigned as finance secretary yesterday – hours before he was due to deliver the budget – after it emerged he sent messages to a -year-old boy. In the online messages, Mackay invited the teen to dinner and a rugby event as well as calling him “cute”.He contacted the boy over a six-month period on Instagram and Facebook.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed Mackay has been suspended from the SNP amid the fallout from the scandal. Shaun said he met Mackay at a SNP fundraising dinner at the Cairndale Hotel in Dumfries in March .  He said: “It was a fundraiser to help getJoan McAlpine re-elected. There were  to  people there. Alex Salmond delivered a speech and Joan was there along with Derek Mackay, who also gave a speech. “I was . I would say Derek Mackay made a beeline for me. “I was with my then partner and introduced her so he knew what the situation was. He was asking general things, such as, ‘What brings you here tonight ’ “I thought it was a bit strange he’d walked past two or three tables to come and talk to me.” Mackay then tracked Shaun down on social media. Shaun has  Facebook friends and counts several SNP MSPs among them. He said: “About a week after the event, I got a friend request from him on Facebook. It was strange because I don’t know how he found out my name. “I wondered why he wanted to be Facebook friends but didn’t think too much about it and accepted. The Facebook Messenger messages started almost immediately. He askedI was gay andI knew what his political position was. He knew fine well I was straight. I made that clear. “To begin with, it was general chit-chat. Then he invited me to stay over in Edinburgh. The address was near the Scottish Parliament. I was polite but never agreed. I knew what he was after. It was quite obvious.  “He would askthe conversation was strictly between us. He was quite pushy. I’m obviously a happily married man. He was being quite sexual, quite suggestive. You would think the messages would stop after being ignored two or three times but I have pages and pages of him messaging me and getting no response. It’s quite creepy.” Shaun said he mostly ignored the messages, which were often sent at night. In January , Mackay messaged: “Are these conversations just between us ” Shaun assured him: “Yeah, of course.” Mackay replies: “Good, would you like to come stay with me sometime ” He added: “I could treat you to some drinks.” After receiving no reply, Mackay said: “Maybe not.” In September that year, Mackay sent a message asking: “Got any naughty pics ” Months later, after receiving no replies from Shaun, the MSP asked: “You not talking to me ” Shaun told the Record: “It was never public Facebook messages, always private. Sometimes he would send ‘hey’ or a wave emoji. It was like he wanted to start a conversation. “I told my we about it. She was angry but I kind of turned a blind eye. I’m an SNP supporter so it was dficult for me to admit this was bad. “I got married last year and kind of ignored him altogether. It had got tiresome and he disappeared for a while. Then he sent messages at the end of last year saying I looked ‘all loved up’ because he would have seen wedding photos on my timeline.” Shaun, who works for a pension firm, is a part-time DJ in nightclubs. He’s been an activist in the SNP for six years. He said: “I responded to the minority of his messages. I’d maybe get  for every one I replied to.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailWhen I appeared on Good Morning Britain with Iain Dale and Nihal Arthanayake this morning, the first item we were asked to discuss was the horric attack that took place at the Tate Gallery a few months ago. A six-year-old boy was thrown off the upper viewing deck of the gallery by -year-old Jonty Bravery, who was in care at the time. This week, a recording was released in which we can hear Jonty telling his carers that he wanted to kill somebody by pushing them off a tall building. The conversation reportedly took place over a year before the attack at the Tate. My immediate reaction to the story was to think back to all the harrowing accounts I had heard from local councillors about the parlous state of children’s social care. The care provided by local councils to some of the most vulnerable teenagers, children and babies in our society has been stripped to the bone by a decade of cuts to local government funding. Central government funding to local government has fallen by nearly % since  and most councils simply don’t have the cash to provide the services vulnerable children need. What’s more, by increasing poverty and unemployment and making it harder for vulnerable families to access services, austerity has increased demand for children’s social care services at the same time as budgets are being cut. Between  and , the number of children in care rose from , to ,. In , the cross-party Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee warned ministers that children’s services were ‘at breaking point’, stating that funding cuts were putting children at risk. The Children’s Commissioner for England concurred, saying councils have been ‘starved’ of funding as a result of the UK’s harsh austerity regime, and that children’s services were ‘at tipping point’.  Given that a series of reports have shown that an overstretched workforce and staff shortages are compromising children’s safety in the care system, it is not unreasonable to assume that funding shortages were one of the reasons Jonty Allen’s case wasn’t escalated sooner. When I made this point on GMB, Dale responded by claiming it was ‘utter rubbish’ and that the case has ‘nothing to do with cuts’. I was about to respond by pointing out that a series of experts – from the Children’s Commissioner, to the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, to the British Medical Association – have said that austerity is compromising the quality of children’s social care services but before I could finish, Dale tore off his microphone and stormed off the set.  The Twitter response was swt and predictable. I was a ‘gobby cow’ and ‘the hard left Katie Hopkins’ for talking about the impact of austerity on our most vulnerable children. Dale, on the other hand, was venerated as a hero by accounts such as ‘Traditional Britain’. Nihal Arthanayake – who was sitting on Dale’s left and weighed in to support my comments – was ‘a lefty Asian spouting socialist s***’. I’m used to receiving abuse online – it’s something that any woman with a  will have experienced at one time or another.

University law graduate Sarah Harvey was working as a PA for a luxury hotel group and lived in an apartment at the iconic ,ft high Marina Torch building in Dubai Marina. But she had been battling depression and anxiety and had been prescribed anti- depressants. An inquest heard that on August  , Miss Harvey, , whose mother is a parish councillor in the village of Rainow, near Macclesfield Cheshire, wrote five suicide notes before leaping from her the window of her flat. She fell  floors before landing on a balcony on floor . Miss Harvey suffered multiple injuries and died at the scene. Police who examined the notes found they expressed Miss Harveyaposs sorrow and of her desire to end it. The hearing in Warrington was told Miss Harvey who attended Fallibroome Academy school in Macclesfield had moved to Dubai after completing a law degree at university in .

There were visits to the UK and phone calls but they revealed nothing and she acted very well. “Sarah discussed with us that she was being prescribed anti depressants but she didn’t elaborate to the depth of her despair. Her friends had noticed a change in her normal going out appearance in the final weeks and they recommended that she sought help which she did do. “But she had made no attempts on her le of any serious nature other than in her first year of university when she suffered with self doubt in her ability.

Ms Haigh said: Last month it was reported that Justice Tolson, the senior family judge in London Central Family Court, found that a woman had not been raped because she hadnapost taken sufficient physical steps to protect herself. The Court of Appeal found that his judgment was aposmanestly at odds with current jurisprudence and based on obsolescent concepts around consentapos. Justice Tolson is still overseeing cases around domestic abuse and rape in the family courts, and just this Monday, despite the Court of Appeal judgment, he made the same ruling again.

If only she knew the terror I felt in that moment of her having to live a le without me in it. I couldn’t pull away from her hug, needed her little arms to stay around my neck forever and ever.

And its not going to make much dference to those for whom declaring their homosexuality is still a le-threatening issueShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsopinion\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailMore than a decade ago, TV presenter Phillip Schofield made a shocking revelation. Turned out, he was grey. For years, he admitted, heaposd hidden his true nature and pretended that he had a mop of reddy-black-brown hair on his head. He confessed to spending decades masquerading as someone younger, and he had decided it was time to wash that lie right out of his hair. No viewers turned off. No-one shunned him. Despite working in an industry where looks were key, it didnapost reduce his employability. In fact it made him a silver fox, a sex symbol for the middle-aged housewives who formed his fanbase. The only people who felt slightly betrayed were those who remembered him fondly as someone with funny-coloured hair who spent a lot of time in a closet. And Schofield coming out of the hairdressers was arguably more of a risk, and a shock, than his announcement today that heaposs slightly-less glad to be gay. He made a statement talking about his inner conflict, the guilt he felt about any harm he was causing his we and family, and later added they had all been supportive and he had no new relationship to be running off to. It all seemed a huge fuss about nothing. Just as few people ever believed that he was naturally mauve, the vastly-positive reaction to his news shows that many of us didnapost think he had quite the same private hobbies as Boris Johnson, either.  Schofield works - and is a well-paid star of - an industry in which gay people are as welcome as any others. His job is safe, viewers are not going to switch off, and itaposs likely that a new, younger audience might be attracted to his show or to him. In the st century, he could even get a career boost with offers of dferent, prime-time work. And so for many the first reaction is probably a shrug, and a muttered who cares  The fact so many of us donapost is a good argument for saying thereaposs no need to let the world know, whatever Diana Ross says. Itaposs no longer a crime to be gay, and it is now a crime to attack people because they are gay. The world is not as bothered as it once was. But yet, in a world where itaposs illegal to abuse or bully someone because theyaposre gay, a man who wrote about tank-topped bumboys, who claimed Labour was encouraging the teaching of homosexuaity in schools, who mocked gay marriage and gays claiming their partneraposs BBC pension, is now Prime Minister. And last year a lesbian couple were bloodied and beaten by a gang of teenagers who attacked them on a night bus after throwing coins at them and urging them to kiss.  The same aposmany of usapos who think Schofield is making a fuss about nothing also think attacks like this are few and far between. But a record number of hate crimes were reported in  , with dramatic rises for those linked to homosexuals and transgender people. And court battles have raged for a year as hardline Muslims have led protests outside a Birmingham primary school that dared to show its pupils a book about two male penguins who raised a chick together. Judges have tried to balance the right of children to be educated with that of adults to demonstrate, and woe betide anyone who asks, well, when did Mohammed ever meet a penguin. Last year a LGBT+ charity revealed a survey that claimed  in  people aged - thought homosexuality was immoral, and were more likely to think it could be aposcuredapos than older generations. So while most of us donapost care, some of us still do. A lot. And in such a way that laws are being broken for something that, like the gene for grey hair, just IS.  Those who praise Schofield for his bravery might like to ask themselvesit is that brave, really, when heaposs a rich, white man in a gay-friendly industry and with a supportive family. Think what might be involved to come out when youaposre so poor you still live at home, surrounded by extended family and school friends,youaposre in an ethnic minority where homosexuality is considered a sin,you work in a job where homosexuality is less acceptable. Or with a family that thinks what you need is an exorcism. Itaposs pretty marvellous that, in my letime, a playground slur has become, first, a badge of defiance and then of so little note that itaposs all but forgotten. Itaposs grand that Schofield can come out to a mixture of back-slapping and boredom. But itaposs a damned shame that his aposbraveryapos will not do much to help a closeted Muslim queen. It probably wonapost alter the opinions of the anti-penguin bigots outside Parkfield School, any more than it surprised a single This Morning fan who will turn around and say well, I always had him down as a womaniser, meself.

The tank graveyard on the outskirts of Eritreaaposs capital Asmara is from the countryaposs vicious war against its much bigger neighbour Ethiopia. The images, taken by amateur photographer Marina Marcato, show piles of hardware stacked high into the beautul African sky, mangled together in army green. Other vehicles such as a classic VW camper van and a German beer bus are also among the cast offs. Cacti sprout from many of the vehicles which local children come and pick the fruit from. The tanks and trucks that litter the site are mostly Ethiopian equipment that were abandoned after the Eritreans successfully defended their capital city. The Ethiopians started the graveyard in an attempt to hide their tanks and equipment rather than leaving them in the street  - giving the people of Eritrea a morale boost.Now that the war is over, and relations between the two east African countries have improved, they pull in tanks and trucks from around the country to the site, so the graveyard is still growing. The unusual site has attracted brave off-the-beaten-track tourists who are curious to see such a spectacle.

His replacement Osman Sow was stretchered off on Saturday.

There is no suggestion that I personally falsied this email.“The suggestion is that I forwarded the email after it had been falsied by someone .“I refute the allegations made against me and I can confirm I will be appealing against my removal from my post.Mr Christie also said he felt that the penalty seemed to be “disproportionate” to the accusations made against him.“No other allegations have been made against me,” he said.“I have worked in my current role for  years and have had an association with the council for  years.“I continue to have a huge respect for my council colleagues, council officers and elected members.“This is a very unfortunate time for me and I will need to take time to look at things moving forward.“I don’t wish to say anything further at this stage but will be making my intentions clear in due course.”Blue Parrot had provided sound equipment for DSMT for previous shows.DSMT producer and manager Lina Waghorn said: “I am shocked and saddened that Kenny Christie is no longer working with the council.“He was a great asset to DSMT and an inspirational teacher.”It’s understood students at DSMT were informed on Sunday January  that Mr Christie was “moving on to new projects”.It was made clear to students he was not ing and that Kris Mordente, a St John’s Academy teacher, would be taking over director permanently.A source at DSMT said: “It’s just a bit strange that he’s gone. Kenny was DSMT and DSMT was Kenny. I don’t think anyone knows how we’re going to operate without him.“He had been growing distant for a while, we have only seen him three times since August and at one point Lina mentioned bringing in an assistant director.“It’s not something we’d expect, I think everyone here including Lina would be reluctant to let him go.”A Blue Parrot spokesman said the company was not awarded the DSMT contract because “strictly speaking, we did not meet the deadline.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We do not comment on inidual personnel matters.”Kenny Christie has been described as one of the most “sought-after” musical theatre directors in the country.He has worked with DSMT for over  years, producing several musicals like Les Miserables and Annie.His directing career began at the age of , producing a one-act play as part of the SCDA drama festival.In , Mr Christie became the world record holder for the fastest theatrical production, taking one piece from book to stage in just . hours.He has also taught and organised dance workshops ,in Dundee and Perth, and has worked with Dundee City Council to organise dance activities for school pupils.Mr Christie has also held the title of chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, as well as being the first Youth Adviser for Scotland for the National Operatic and Dramatic Association.Kenny Christie’s sacking comes in the wake of a separate fraud scandal that has rocked Dundee City Council in the past year.In October, the council’s head of construction Mark Ross quit in the midst of an investigation into claims he was treated to a golfing trip on the Spanish coast by bosses of a firm awarded an £ million local authority contract.The £.m deal to provide heat and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors was awarded to Edmundson Electrical without going out to tender.The trip to Spain took place weeks after the contract was awarded and included Mr Ross, a senior Edmundson staff member, another council employee and representatives of two other firms.It was later revealed that the second council employee was Kenny Muir, who also worked in the council’s construction department.He was sacked from his role earlier this month.Mr Muir is the fourth senior employee to leave construction services since September, following the resignations of Mr Ross and electrical supervisor Iain Gardyne, who is accused of selling thousands of pounds’ worth of council smoke alarms online."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e3930203b5672.98108232-836x564.jpg ","title":"mcpake id like another striker but im happy to go with just two","story":"Dundee boss James McPake admits he’d like another striker in his squad but slim pickings in the free agent market means he’s happy to stick with just two for the rest of the campaign.An ultimately failed deal to bring in St Mirren frontman Danny Mullen went right to the wire on transfer deadline day.That was frustrating for the Dens boss but he’s more than happy with the quality of the two strikers he has at his disposal.Andrew Nelson ed to full training today after surgery to fix a broken hand while Kane Hemmings notched his seventh league goal of the season at Morton on Saturday .James said: “I would like another striker.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby players pictured in their prime","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA black and white photograph featuring a Mid Argyll Rugby team, handed to the Argyllshire Advertiser by Tayvallich reader Donald Carmichael, has generated a great deal of interest.After we asked our knowledgeable readers to tell us a little more about the photograph, Lochgilphead#s Murray MacFarlane visited the office to offer some background information on the image.Murray named every member of the team in the photograph, but added: #I was playing rugby as stand-off at that time as well, so I must have had a hangover or something when the photo was taken.#He recalled that Mid Argyll Rugby Club played in the Glasgow District League and only just missed out on promotion to the national leagues during the s.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

ad-hoc maintenance.And once the dated systems finally falter, they should be removed.Currently one-in-four of the cameras around Borders town centres arenrsquot working with many more expected to go offline in the next couple of years.The planned eventual black-out of monitoring in eight town centres ndash Duns, Eyemouth, Galashiels, Hawick, Kelso, Melrose, Peebles and Selkirk ndash follows a region-wide consultation.Although the majority of the  respondents believed that CCTV was effective in fighting crime and provided a safer environment, Scottish Borders Council isnrsquot willing to spend the estimated pound, on a replacement system.SBC team leader Alex Young said: ldquoThe councilrsquos current position with regard to CCTV provision is not to install new CCTV equipment or replace le-expired systems but to continue to maintain the current asset within the existing revenue budget until they are beyond economic repair.Although the cameras are used to provide evidence following crimes, Police Scotland has continually refused to help fund the upkeep or replacement of the system.And, with the local authority already footing a pound, bill for two Police Community Action Teams, many councillors believe the Police should be paying their way.Police Scotland didnrsquot provide any information regarding the use of CCTV during the recent local authority consultation.Mr Young added: ldquoWhile the Police are supportive of continuing to provide a CCTV provision within the local communities, Police Scotland are not in a position to contribute to the funding of public space CCTV in the Borders, either in terms of the initial capital investment or on-going revenue costs.ldquoOfficers have unfortunately been unable to determine, or obtain, any substantive data or statistical information that demonstrates the frequency at which CCTV footage is accessed in any given community, the basis on which this footage might be used to support any legal action or community safety initiative or indeed its use in any successful prosecution.ldquoPolice Scotland have been requested to provide a formal statement but unfortunately to date have been unable to do so.Councillors are being recommended to continue maintaining the current system until it no longer works when they meet on

and embarked on a year-long campaign to eradicate dog fouling.Now, thanks to a successful bid for funding, new bins and bag dispensers have been located throughout the town.ldquoIrsquove always found the notion of dog poo smeared across our streets abhorrent, even as a small child, said community councillor Jackie Couchman.ldquoInnerleithen has a high density of dogs in a relatively small area which magnies the issue.ldquoMost dog owners are responsible and pick up, a sizeable minority do not and, it would seem, will not. I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"council-asked-declare-interest-planet","story":"CAMPAIGNERS descended on Thursdays meeting of Scottish Borders Council in a bid to convince the local authority to declare a Climate Emergency.So far  councils across Scotland have made the declaration as efforts continue to halt and reverse the damage being done to the planet.Despite the Extinction Rebellion protest outside the council headquarters at Newtown St Boswells, bosses have yet to issue any statement.Protestor Jennie Gibson said: \"The declaration is the first step to deal with the problem.\"It shows the council takes climate crisis seriously and so should we.\"It means they have to make plans to cut emissions and we can seethey do it or not.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

We are a public body\".He said: \"We have looked very carefully at all the options and this site is the only viable one. If the project does not go ahead on this site, it is very dficult to see it going ahead at all.\"The proposed site is on the Gilmerton estate, south of the current museum.Councillors questioned whether a field to the west of the Scheduled Monument had also been looked at and were told that Historic Environment Scotland had said it would not allow the hangar to be built there either.The planned removal of the trees had led to a public outcry, with an online petition against it gaining more than , signatures.The Woodland Trust told the council that replanting trees would not replace some of the ancient woodland which it said would be lostthe plans were given the go ahead.And Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, pointed out that East Lothian councillors had declared a climate emergency last year.The committee was told it was likely the new trees would take  years before they equalled the positive impact the felled woodland had on the countys carbon footprint.Fellow committee member Councillor Fiona ODonnell said: \"When this council took a decision about climate change we used the word emergency, not down the line, so we cant lose  years.\"I think the loss is not a price worth paying.\"Three councillors supported the plans, which were recommended for approval by planning officers, including Provost John McMillan, who is the administrations economic development spokesperson.He said: \"I believe in the round this will be doing something for public benefit.\"His views were supported by councillors Lachlan Bruce and Katie Mackie, who pointed to the jobs benefit of the new centre and increase in tourism.Councillor Mackie said: \"One of the things I love about East Lothian is its natural heritage but the introduction of  jobs and need for people not to have to commute to Edinburgh for work is really important.\"Councillor Colin McGinn told the committee that a young boy who attended the meeting with family told him when he came in to \"save the trees\".He said: \"This is about their future. If we make a decision to cut down  trees we are doing him a disservice.\"Councillor Jeremy Findlay refused to support the planning application, saying he was not convinced all other options had been considered.He said: \"I would encourage the Museum of Flight to go back to Historic Environment Scotland and have further discussions with them.\"I am not convinced they will turn round and say no, we have not seen any evidence they will.\"A National Museums Scotland spokeswoman said: \"We are disappointed by the outcome of the East Lothian Council planning committee meeting.\"This is an important project for East Lothian. It will ensure the preservation of historically important aircraft, it will also create jobs and play a transformative role within the local tourism economy.\"We will now take stock and review our next steps.The committee rejected the planning application on the grounds it would result in the loss of  trees, to the detriment of the climate of East Lothian and the councils climate policy, by eight votes to three.Councillors who voted against were Jeremy Findlay, Sue Kempson, Fiona ODonnell, Neil Gilbert, John Williamson, Kenny McLeod, Colin McGinn and Norman Hampshire.

In the case of fully electric cars, those emissions are zero.There are plenty of electric cars to choose from. There are the self-charging hybrids. These use a combination of an engine with a battery and have the ability to run for a short while in zero emission mode. Such vehicles do not require charging by you.On the other hand, Plug-in Electric Hybrids - often abbreviated to PHEV - have an engine but feature a larger battery that can be charged from the mains or from a home charging unit. These have the ability to run emission-free for around - miles - enough for your daily commute.Finally electric cars - often called EVsor BEVs- only have a battery. They require charging from a home charging unit to run continuously in zero emission mode.Of course, technology is fast-moving. Where once a fully electric car had a range of barely  miles, todayrsquos electric cars offer in excess of  miles.So how do you stay ahead of technology without incurring huge costs and loss of value in a car One way is through car leasing. Leasing companies, such as Intelligent Car Leasing, are specialists in electric car leasing.Although you never own the car, you can lease the vehicle over ,  or even  months for regular and affordable monthly payments.At the end of each lease, you simply renew for a brand new, more technologically advanced vehicle. The process is very simple. No haggling with pushy car sales people over price no issues with selling it later on.There are certain conditions you have to be aware of - such as the carrsquos appearance and the number of miles travelled.

Despite there being more than a quarter of a million electric cars registrations in the UK between  and , many prospective buyers remain cautious.The top concern of car-buyers is the range of EVs. Of course, itrsquos true that in some of the fledgling models, range was an issue, but technology has moved on. The Nissan Leaf, for example, will drive for  miles before needing a recharge. The range is clearly displayed on the dashboard, so therersquos no danger of getting caught short. And the reality is,  per cent of journeys in the UK are shorter than  miles, so there is a high likelihood that it will meet the needs of most people.Charge times are another concern. A full charge on the Leaf takes eight hours but a quick charge will provide  per cent capacity in only half an hour. And with more and more investment being ploughed into EV infrastructure and charging points around the country, filling up the tank is becoming easier and easier every day.Speed is a popular misconception too. If when you think about an electric car, golf buggies and dodgem cars spring to mind, it might be time to think again. Far from being sluggish, modern EVs have excellent acceleration. The new Leaf can go from -mph in . seconds and has a top speed of mph. And they produce instant torque, meaning the start-stop transition is slick and immediate.Fully electric vehicles are, of course, only the tip of the iceberg for the eco-conscious, eager to get ahead of the curve on green issues. Hybrid cars have batteries which are charged up on long motorway journeys, enabling them to power shorter trips about town, saving fuel without the need to schedule trips around charging points.Hybrids are a good compromise for those who arenrsquot necessarily ready to make the full leap to electric, combining some of the benefits of EVs like lower road tax, savings on fuels and reduced carbon footprint, without taking the plunge into completely new territory.Both Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central and Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South have gained Electric Vehicle Approved Status , so the teams there are well-equipped to advise customers about changing to an electric or hybrid vehicle.Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South,  Welbeck Road, Darnley, Glasgow, G SDwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-south Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central,  Port Dundas Road, Glasgow, G HZwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-central ------------------------------------------------------------------------Helensburgh Toyota For Toyota, hybrid really isnrsquot anything new as they first manufactured hybrid vehicles more than  years ago.

The cars are self-charging which means every moment you are driving, your battery is charging even when slowing down, so no need to plug anything in. Whether in the town or on the motorway, hybrids feel no dferent to drive than a petrol car, offering a quiet and relaxing ride and still delivers the power you need.Speaking about the increase in hybrid orders, Kirsteen McGuire, Helensburgh Toyota Sales Manager said: ldquoThe hybrid message across the car industry is finally hitting home. More and more people are making the switch to hybrid and in turn benefitting from lower tax and petrol costs. Where other car manufacturers are playing catch up, Toyota has been a trusted advocate of hybrid technology for many years. The reality is that manufacturers are moving to eventually producing only hybrid vehicles. I have worked for Helensburgh Toyota for  years and demand for hybrid has never been higher.If yoursquore new to Hybrid and are looking to experience Toyota Hybrid for yourself, why not book and appointment at the Helensburgh Hybrid Drive Event on Saturday  February.The team at Helensburgh Toyota are only too happy to give you more information and take you out on a test drive.www.facebook HelensburghToyota videos  sfnsmowww.facebook HelensburghToyota videos  sfnsmowww.helensburgh.toyota-------------------------------------------------------------------JorroIn  Jorro was created to be specialists in EV Charging for drivers and businesses across Scotland. Taking experience in renewable energy using Solar PV and a passion for zero emission transport, they decided that an independent company not linked to any manufacturer of cars, charge points or energy provider, would allow them to offer impartial advice to customers choosing to go electric for the first time.When plugging in the car at home, the smart charge point automatically decides when it is cheapest to charge. Paying just p per kWh overnight, which means you can travel up to , miles for just pound, compared to over pound in an efficient mpg petrol or diesel car. Even using typical electricity tarfs, customers are travelling over , miles per year for less than pound.To encourage EV drivers to charge safely at home rather than relying on the pin plug adaptor, the UK Government offers pound OLEV grant towards the cost of installing a home charge point.

And then Johnson decided to ban media he doesnrsquot like from official briefings.Trump had the press by the throat from day one. It was either lick his boots, or suffer. Strongmen wannabes like to keep critics quiet. Erdogan in Turkey, Orban in Hungary ndash like Johnson, theyrsquore big Trump buddies ndash and like Trump they want a tame press.Once the press is dealt with, then itrsquos time to start tinkering with other inconveniences which check power, like judges. Johnson has hinted that the judiciary will have a price to pay for meddling in Brexit.So buckle up for a bumpy ride, while Johnson gets Brexit done.How will the Scottish Government and the SNP deal with this  Strongmen-types also like an enemy. Thatrsquos the role Johnson wants the SNP to play.Johnson is an agent of chaos. He wins by creating drama and then letting his rivals drown amid a welter of headlines as they try to figure out what the hell is going on. He causes chaos, others step in to clean up the mess, and they take the bullet for their troubles. Just ask David Cameron and Theresa May. Or cast an eye over what remains of the Labour party.The SNP may think being pitted against Johnson is good for them, but is it also good for Scotland So far, the SNPrsquos response to Johnson has been to shout \"independence\" at every opportunity. Party managers might believe this to be a great strategy ndash that it keeps passion burning in the hearts of true believers ndash but itrsquos already getting wearying.Throughout the torture of Brexit ndash in fact, in response to almost anything that ever happens at Westminster ndash itrsquos looked to the public asall the SNP does is simply shout independence.The tactic is beginning to suffer from the law of diminishing s. The more itrsquos heard, the more meaningless it becomes. And the more itrsquos shouted, the more one wondersthe party has any other ideas.Johnson knows the public in Scotland is as tired as the public where on these islands after Brexit. The idea of more endless constitutional warfare is far from appealing. Every time the SNP shouts independence at Johnson, many voters wince at the thought of more ision. Johnson also knows that all the SNP can do is shout ndash as, like it or not, he decidesand when therersquos a referendum.If the SNP continues to endlessly shout independence when we all know there wonrsquot be a referendum any time soon then it will appear not just like a grievance machine, but weak. Even worse, the SNP will look like itrsquos playing the public for fools.Endless cries of independence will also achieve little in Scotland. The Yes and No side are polling pretty evenly. Only clever, original politicking will change minds.Nicola Sturgeon has admitted there may not be another referendum until after the next Scottish elections. Everyone  knew this was the case, but to the marchers and flag-wavers, it was betrayal. You can see why ndash they were led by the nose, the mantra of independence fed to them daily. Now they feel cheated. So, the strategy of endlessly crying independence has already caused harm within the party.To many average Yes voters, the endless calls for independence are now like background static. The SNP risks becoming boring, a one-note tune that everyone knows. In modern politics, boredom means defeat. Itrsquos not that the Yes movement is boring, we expect the Yes movement to play one instrument and play it well. But with a party, you want an orchestra.Of course, the party would say that it does much more than shout about independence. True, but impressions matter, and it seems the SNP has only one word as answer to every question.The party itself is tired. Itrsquos record in government is increasingly anaemic when it comes to big domestic issues like health and schools.Perhaps, the party thinks concentrating on independence takes the focus off poor hospitals and education  Well, maybe it would,the SNP could stick to one message on independence.Therersquos constant mixed messaging. Some take pots shots at the leadership. Others are loyal. Some fancy wildcat referendums. Others donrsquot. Some say stop marching. Others wave their Saltire. Some cosy up to online bullies. Others decry them.Then lsquoexcitementrsquo around Nicola Sturgeonrsquos much-awaited speech last week on the future of independence turns anti-climactic. It was staid, managerial. She called for patience, said therersquod be no shortcuts, and urged the party to build the case for independence.Voters would be forgiven for asking whatrsquos going on  Run the country, quit bickering, and stop leading us all on. Outside the twin bubbles of politics and the press, and the echo chamber of social media, the public cares about jobs, schools, cops on the beat, and hospitals.Sturgeon also plans a Constitutional Convention and a series of papers on independence. This work needs done, but it will also add to the narrative that all the SNP talks about is independence.And whisper it, unlikely though it is, Brexit may not usher in a new Dark Age. It might go OK. It might just be a bit awful. If the cataclysm doesnrsquot appear, what does that mean for independence The one thing which will help independence  Good government. Run this country well and No voters may slowly but surely switch to Yes.Noel Dolan, Sturgeonrsquos former senior adviser, made clear yesterday that itrsquos pointless to simply demand that Johnson grants another referendum. Dolanrsquos right. The only path to another referendum is for the SNP and Labour to cut a deal in order to get the Tories out of power. The SNP supports the next Labour government, and then Labour agrees to a second independence referendum.Itrsquoll take time, but the strategy is correct: donrsquot just talk ndash do.

Nature plays a key role in defining and regulating our climate and climate is key in shaping the state of nature.“People and communities who want to be at the forefront of pioneering work to restore our habitats, protect our species and promote nature can now apply for additional support through the Bioersity Challenge Fund.”Scottish Natural Heritage chief executive Francesca Osowska has been excited by the very high quality of applications received so far, and would love to hear even more bright ideas.“People know that climate change is a big issue but not as many know that bioersity loss is also a global and generational threat to human well-being,” she said. “Pollinators are a vital part of the building blocks of le on earth, and we need to support all of Scotland’s bioersity, from bees and butterflies to pondle and peatlands, because enriching our nature is also an important part of the solution to the climate emergency.“Nature is at the heart of what we do, and we will continue to deliver the transformational change needed to bring a nature-rich future for Scotland.”More information about the fund can be found at Bioersity Challenge Funddata-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The fire service is eager for us all to avoid the devastating consequences of white goods catching fire in our homes.\"  Fires caused by white goods are a daily occurence viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"brewdog ellon visitor centre plan approved","story":"Plans to create a new bar and visitor centre in Ellon have been approved.Brewing giants BrewDog submitted plans to Aberdeenshire Council in November last year for the creation of a new bar and visitor centre next to its Ellon headquarters.The new bar and visitor centre will be located inside the existing building at Balmacassie Industrial Estate that previously belonged to Power Jacks.The brewing firm will change part of the unit from office accommodation and production space to a new ‘DogTap’ public house and visitor centre.BrewDog took ownership of the building in  after Power Jacks moved to Westhill. It was initially proposed that BrewDog would transform the building into ‘The DogHouse’ Hotel but the plan never came to fruition.The new proposal will see the relocation of the existing ‘DogTap’ bar which is “oversubscribed” and no longer suitable to meet customer demand.The new bar will also feature a ‘BottleDog’ retail area where customers can buy bottles of beer and other merchandise. As with the existing bar, food will continue to be served on the site.A dedicated events space and beer museum will be created to give visitors the chance to see how the brewing process works.External changes will be made to the existing site including the addition of an outdoor seating area and children’s play area.Aberdeenshire Council planners approved the plans stating that the proposal is “appropriate” for the site given and “is in keeping with the character of the wider area in that it provides s directly related and ancillary to neighbouring sites”.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpeg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Gillian Martin MSP with Ron MacDonald, Secretary of the Newburgh  Ythan Community Trust, at Ythan Estuary\"  MSP welcomes Ythan Seal Viewing Project cash viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"new appointment for inverurie orchestra","story":"Inverurie Orchestra has welcomed Ignasi Sol# as its new Conductor and Music Director.The appointment comes following the departure of Dr Paul Tierney last year who led the -strong orchestra from its inception in .The Orchestra played its last concert with Dr Tierney before Christmas to a packed Acorn Centre delivering \"The Snowman\" to considerable acclaim.Dr Tierney is moving on to embrace other responsibilities and continues as Music Director at Haddo.Ignasi was born in Catalunya and began his cello studies at the age of  tutored by the cello disciples of Pablo Casals, Jacques Doué and Peter Thielemann.During his youth Ignasi won several prizes for young musicians.At the age of  he was accepted at the prestigious Liceu of Barcelona to study cello performance with the principal cello of the Spanish National Symphony Orchestra, Angel Luis Quintana.At the same time he took up a place as solo cello at the Young Opera of Catalonia.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And, just to be clear, it would be equally as seriousthe teenager in question had been a girl.It is likely there is cross-party agreement that the -year-old Mackay should now stand down as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West. However, Nicola Sturgeon was right when she said that “no matter how upset and shocked all of us are in these situations, there’s a need for due process”.Despite the scale of the justied outrage, the full facts need to be established in a calm and considered way. After all, there may be questions for others to answer.It has long been known that those in positions of power will sometimes abuse it, but the MeToo movement should have spelt out the full consequences to anyone failing to grasp them.Once such conduct might have been brushed under the carpet, but society has changed, considerably and for the better, in refusing to tolerate it.MSPs are the democratically elected leaders of this country and their actions must be beyond reproach. It is, or at least should be, part of their job to send a message to those in positions of power in wider society about what is and is not acceptable behaviour.And an MSP, let alone a Cabinet minister, sending scores of unsolicited messages of the type described to a -year-old is, in the words of the First Minister, “unacceptable”.

Ms Sturgeon has insisted she’s not going anywhere in response to speculation about her future, but it would seem that justice secretary Humza Yousaf now has a clear run at the top job – should it one day become available.The immediate headache for Ms Sturgeon is who to fill the breach as new finance secretary – one of the most important and responsible roles in Government given the suite of tax new powers that are now presided over at Holyrood.Public finance minister Kate Forbes did her hopes no harm after a strong andpolished performance at Holyrood yesterday, stepping into the breach to deliver the Budget in Mr Mackay’s absence.Widely seen as a rising star of Scottish politics, she won plaudits recently from the business community after blocking unpopular plans to hand control of rates over to councils.But at  and having only become a minister a year-and-a-half ago, she may be deemed to lack the experience required for the one of the most challenging and high-profile roles in the Scottish Government.It may be that Ms Sturgeon could look to promote a junior minister such as Paul Wheelhouse, who has the energy brief, into the role or possibly sht Michael Matheson from transport.Universities minister Richard Lochhead, who has nine years of experience as a Cabinet secretary, could also be a contender. The dilemma Ms \u2028Sturgeon faces is that whoever is appointed will not just be presiding over the devolved public finances under the constitutional \u2028set-up at Holyrood.This needs to be someone who can sell the economic case for independence as the Scottish Government demands the right to hold a second referendum on leaving the UK.Mr Mackay sat on the SNP’s Growth Commission, which set out a financial blueprint for independence and had already tasked civil servants with drawing up an “alternative” to the controversial Government Expenditure and Revenue in Scotlandfigures, which set out the deficit that Scotland runs inside the UK.Mr Mackay had pledged his new paper would present the opportunities of independence.The economic argument was where the Yes campaign fell down in  and the new finance secretary will play a critical role in convincing voters that Scotland is strong enoughto go it alone economically after independencea referendum is to take place in the next year.And, of course, this shock resignation for Ms Sturgeon comes just a month before her predecessor and mentor, former first minister Alex Salmond, is scheduled to go on trial where he faces a string of sexual assault charges after ten women brought complaints against him.Salmond denies all wrongdoing.The fallout from the Mackay case, with opposition parties demanding his departure as an MSP, could well drag out over coming weeks.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brian pendreigh remembering kirk douglas the most scottish sounding of hollywood superstars","story":"In the s, when I was a boy, I used to press my finger into my chin to replicate Kirk Douglas#s dimple. I grew up on his historical adventures and westerns, preferring his complex, flawed characters to John Wayne#s barrel-chested dimwits. I wanted the dimple and the swagger and the grand gestures. I wanted to say: #I am Spartacus#.This most Scottish-sounding of Hollywood superstars was of east European Jewish stock, but Kirk Douglas sounded more like a movie star than Issur Danielovitch. He did come to Scotland in the early s to make Catch Me a Spy. Pursued across the Highlands, he is seen fishing on Loch Awe, at the local railway station, on the Ballachulish ferry and running through a herd of Highland cattle.Years later I met him at a film festival in Palm Springs, where he lived and where there is a street called the Kirk Douglas Way. He had had a stroke a few years previous and was very frail. I would have said he had only a few months remaining. That was  years ago.Kirk was a fighter on screen and off, standing side by side with Burt Lancaster at the OK Corral and doing as much as anyone in the battle against the Hollywood “blacklist”. As producer of Spartacus he hired the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo to pen this tale of an uprising against tyranny.Ten years after I met Kirk in Calornia I went to interview a little old lady called Kay Mander over lunch in Kirkcudbrightshire. She was in her mid-s, living anonymously in a local authority bungalow, though she had been a pioneer documentary-maker during the Second World War. Suddenly out of the blue she revealed she and Kirk had been lovers.They worked together on Heroes of Telemark half a century earlier. They were both married. For her it was a big deal, but not for Kirk. “He had this awful reputation,” she said. “He flew his ladies in first class, kept them there for a long weekend, and sent them back tourist.” It was the Kirk Douglas way. And yet Kay Mander thought he was “wonderful”. Her only regret was the pain it caused her husband. “Kirk Douglas was my passion,” she said.Kirk appeared in a string of acclaimed classics – Spartacus, Ace in the Hole, Paths of Glory. He was great as Doc Holliday coughing up his lungs in Gunfight at the OK Corral. He was never the subtlest actor – John Kricfalusi, creator of the cartoon Ren and Stimpy, said: “He doesn’t just act with his face– he can act with his back. Kirk’s the only actor I’ve ever seen who can act with his back. They’ll have a shot of him from behind and you’ll see muscles twitching.”Kirk was compelling too in a string of films no one has ever heard of.I included two in my top  favourite obscure films when I edited the book The Times on Cinema. A Gunfight boiled the western down to a setpiece as Kirk faced off against Johnny Cash. You needed two iconic figures to make it work. And in The Last Sunset he was an outlaw who turns up on the doorstep of an old flame and discovers she has a husband and a grown-up daughter. He falls in love with the daughter, only to discover he is her father – Greek tragedy in Wild West clothing.He could do dark. But he could also do light. He put everything into acting and into le. He was a charmer, a fighter, a legend and it seemed like he would go on forever. There was never a time he was not in my le. I was in the pub on Wednesday night enjoying a pint or two with my mate Niall and telling him Kirk was now . “I thought he was dead,” said Niall. It must have been right about that time that he did finally pass away. A few hours later I was looking at the news online and there it was – Kirk Douglas was dead.I still have the dimple and the memories, but in that headline a little part of me died too.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nafc pair shortlisted in national lantra finals ","story":"Valentina Romano and Jimmy Dakin are in the running for the Lantra Scotland awards.Jimmy Dakin from Sanday in Orkney has been shortlisted as Aquaculture Learner of the Year.

I already knew that the library held old copies of newspapers from previous research but I was unaware of the sheer volume of information available, and the fact that the library holds documents dating back to the early s.The open day allowed members of the public to come in, ask questions, get to know the department and find out how to use the resources to discover their family history and also the story of Ballymena‘ was like years ago’s growth as a town.The Heritage Collection will mean dferent things to dferent people. Some will have a purpose for their search, such as finding a long lost relative or tracing a map of their home area from years gone by. Others will simply visit and get lost in the vast records, pictures and resources on offer.As a bit of a history buff, I was transported back to my university and school days as Daniel Brown, the senior library assistant for the Heritage Department spoke of some of the hidden treasures within the library.He said past records of the old workhouse are available, giving an extraordinary insight into who was actually in the dreaded facility down through the years, and also into the meetings held by some of the officers.We have artefacts dating back hundreds of years. Some are very valuable to us today, such as a complete map of the original Adair estate from  as much can be learned from this. We also have lots of interesting memorabilia including war rationing books and images of the Queens visit to Ballymena after her coronation.Daniel, who has a personal interest in history, really enjoys showing people around the department, whether they be locals or from further afield.He told me: Weve had many tourists come in, especially Americans who are keen to learn more about their ancestry and research old family names. Its interesting looking back and helping people discover where they come from!You can also trace old church history through births, deaths and marriages, communion and membership rolls and even church offerings.It was down this path that I met Mary Carson and Anne McCaughey as they browsed through the pew rental records of Buckna Presbyterian Church dating back to .Both ladies are members of the Broughshane History Society and were looking through the old records searching for ious recognisable names, however their inidual interest in local and family history was not hard to see.Mary spoke about tracing her family tree and how her curiosity was fuelled by seeing two old pictures of her grandparents at her aunt’s house.She followed rthe trail to a local heritage collection where she was able to find out through old newspapers that her grandfather’s death had made front page news many years before.Her search also revealed that a family member she always believed to be her uncle actually turned out to be her cousin!Researching and delving into the past is so interesting in my opinion, and can also be rewarding, Mary told me. I have found out that Im related to, so many people I didnt know about.Anne agreed, and was full of praise for the resources available in the library. She recalled happy times of listening to older family members talk about the past but said it is often not like that today.Today the younger generation dont seem to be as interested. They are busy working on phones or listening to their earphones that they dont seem to care whats going on around them or what has went before, so they are going to have to depend on information and places like this library to trace their past.As I left them to their church history search, my eyes were drawn to the vast arrays of cases containing maps along a wall.Here there are ordnance survey maps from the s right up to the s. There are also Grfith valuation maps for Co. Antrim and Co. Londonderry as well as th century town plans and local government maps - it really is a local history lovers dream!There are far too many resources to list, but some that need a mention include the vast photograph collection from around Co. Antrim as well as multiple information packs on local schools, people and places all arranged by location and subject.Two of the special collections housed in Ballymena library is the Langford Lodge Collection and the  census for parishes in Co. Antrim.The Collection Officer for the library is Maria Diamond, who is always on hand to direct the public to what they are looking for.She was keen to point out the many online resources made available by the library, so as your search doesnt have to end when you go home!Family history and researching your ancestry has really taken off in the last few years, Maria told me.Therefore we have listed many online resources that can help people trace their history in their own time, or when the library may be closed.Maria enjoys her job, and said she has noticed an increase in the number of people using the department.We are generally a busy department, and we try to always be on hand to help guide people to their desired field of study.“We also enjoy welcoming groups and school classes to the Heritage Collection and tailor the activities to their age or field of study. We have lots of resources for children, and a wealth of information on the local area and how it was affected during major events in history, such as the two world wars or the famine. Teachers or groups just need to get in touch to arrange a visit.I was thoroughly impressed by my visit to the local studies department.Yes, I knew alot of information was available, however I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of resources, how far back it dated and the way in which it was displayed.No matter what period you are interested in, or what local area there is sure to be some information that will aid your study.My visit to the Cultural heritage open day may have been for business, but my next visit to discover Ballymena of old will more than likely be for pleasure!

He attended St Mary’s Primary School in Portglenone and St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena.Speaking about his early involvement in music, he said: My parents didn’t play but they sent all of us to music and dancing for years and drove us to lessons and events every night of the week, I owe them a lot for that. They had a keen interest and were very supportive.I was sent to the local Comhaltas Ceoltoacuteiriacute Eacuteireannbranch in Portglenone when I was around .I started tin whistle classes with the late John Kennedy first, then progressed onto the button accordion with Tommy Doherty.My parents then started taking us to The Crosskey’s Inn every week for sessions and I also joined the Comahltas branch there too.That place had a huge effect on me, there were great musicians there of all ages and they really helped cultivate my interest growing up. I still go there when I can.As part of the Crosskeys Comhaltas we won many All-Irelands. We had a great gang at the time along with dedicated parents that were also passionate about the music.Going to the Fleadhs was as much about socialising with other kids in music as it was competing. We got up to all sorts of ilment that I won’t get into here!I started on the tin whistle, moved to button accordion then started to teach myself guitar when I was . I quickly became obsessed with the guitar.Its such a versatile instrument and one that you can literally play or learn any style of music on.From playing the guitar I was able to give a few other stringed instruments a go - bouzouki, tenor guitar, bass, electric guitar.Its not a big stretch to adapt the same skills on guitar over to other instruments, and its nice to have dferent colours available, especially when writing.Sometimes I write on the piano - because I’m not great at playing piano, you’re forced to think dferently and that can work in your favour.In terms of my influences, for the accordion it would be Mairtin OConnor or Dermot Byrne. For the guitar, its harder to narrow it down, but three that stand out are Arty Mc Glynn, Steve Cooney and John Doyle. My own style is probably some hybrid mix of those three.I have worked with Grammy nominated fiddler Liz Carroll, folk singer Karan Casey, Duke Special, Liam O’Maonlaiand Bela Fleck.I am involved with ‘Ulaid’ with John Mc Sherry and Donal O’Connor, and Scottish group ‘Fiddlers Bid’. As a guitar player I regularly work with a lot of other traditional bands including Lunasa, Flook, Buille, and the Mairtin O’Connor Band.BEOGABeoga was formed while Seaacuten was a pupil at St Louis Grammar School.He continued: At St Louis, I was involved with the Traditional Group the whole time I was there.Frank Cassidy directed it and was always very encouraging. We competed in ‘Slogadh’ competitionsand had great craic travelling around to the dferent competitions.Beoga was formed around this time and the teachers were very understanding about me missing days here and there to play gigs.I used to go to the States for these long weekends and be catching up on school work on the plane home.Whilst at St Louis I never actually studied music as an option. I didn’t have a classical background and for some reason never thought it would be a viable career option!Whilst studying for my A levels, I started to become really obsessed with music and decided that was it - I couldn’t even think about doing anything .Up until that point I was looking at careers in IT. I heard about a new course in University of Limerick offering a degree in Irish music, that didn’t require A level music, you just had to go for an interview and perform.I got in anyway and I met Niamh there. We were in the same class and became big pals and she ended up joining the band.She’s an amazing fiddle player and singer and I’m lucky to have found her!ED SHEERANBeoga have been together for around  years and they have been afforded the opportunity to travel the world doing what they love.Seaacuten said: We’ve toured a lot around Europe and North America but have also been lucky to tour in more exotic places like Japan, Australia and Russia. We’re travelling a bit less now, thankfully, but at one stage I was definitely seeing more of the band than my own family.One of the biggest audiences the band have performed to was a , strong crowd at the Glastonbury festival in  alongside Ed Sheeran.Sheeran, whose grandparents hail from the Emerald Isle, is well-known for his love of Irish traditional and folk music, even recording a version of The Parting Glass.He has said that one of his earliest musical memories is listening to the Irish Heartbeat album by Van Morrison and The Chieftains and he is also a fan of The Bothy Band and Planxty. Close friend of the band, Foy Vance, shares the same record label as Sheeran and had been supporting him on tour. They had listened to a few of Beogas tunes on the road, and Ed reached out to the band to help with his album.Seaacuten explained: We went to over to his house in Suffolk for a couple of days. It was all very relaxed, he made everyone feel completely at ease.The weather was amazing so we were outside in the garden a lot. We played on four tracks and two made it to the album so we’re delighted.One of them, ‘Galway Girl’, came about just jamming in the garden outside the studio. He was completely sound, we stayed in his house and had a few beers and even played a game of football at one stage.Working with Ed has presented a lot of new opportunities to play and write with other artists.Our friend Foy Vance was the guy responsible for introducing us to Ed. We’ve written a good few songs with Foy now and will hopefully keep creating more with him, he’s an amazing singer and an even more amazing songwriter and is finally being recognised as such.We’ve also worked with Johnny McDaid on the songwriting and production side of things, although he’s been crazy busy since Snow Patrol started touring again.Just recently we’ve been writing a bit with Cormac Neeson from ‘The Answer’. The collaborations are really exciting to me, you just don’t know whats going to come out of a writing session but that buzz of finishing the day with a song is a real high.Seaacuten believes there is a great local traditional music scene stating: I think traditional music is stronger than ever.He encourages all age groups to get involved and give it a try, commenting: If I had any advice, it would be to not to get too worked up about competitions and instead focus more on the social side of the music.While competitions can be good to focus on something, it can put a lot of unnecessary pressure on kids.In his rare free time, Seaacuten has a purpose built recording studio in Portglenone called Bannview Studios.He has been recording for about  years and recently moved into his current space about five years ago.He said:I regularly engineer and produce other artists here, so that keeps me busy outside of the bands schedule.Beoga will be releasing a new album in the Spring. It will include singles released over the last few months along with some new songs and instrumentals that the group have been working on over the last year.Beogas latest release is called ‘Make a Mark’ and features Co. Down singer Ryan Mc Mullan.

Starchild and the New Romantic for example - a NY soulster I came across last week. Locally, Brand New Friend from Castlerock, are an outstanding punk pop sound. Anyway, here goes…!. Town Called Malice - The Jam. Laser eyed social poetry from Weller, tight Tamla baseline from Foxton and finger clicking rhythm from Buckler. Classic mod. . The Highest Apple - Runrig. Spiritual Scots Gaelic song. Our wedding dance, along with Van the Man of course,  years ago. . This Beautul Day - Levi Jackson. I used to be a Northern Soul DJ and had quite a collection of original vinyl singles. I love the genre still. This track has it all: dance, clear gospel uplt, a black civil rights cry for hope. It’s worth hundreds. I once tried to buy it on eBay behind my we’s back. Thankfully the bid didn’t make it. Confession is good for the soul. . Kennedy - The Wedding Present. Indie student guitar based noise. Great band live from the late s. Still going. Much the same as Copper Blue by Sugar - another favorite indie band.. Live Forever - Oasis. Slightly later and closer to the football culture of which I was a part in my youth. I interviewed them twice for music fanzines before they were famous. Influenced greatly by the Stone Roses - another favourite band. . At Least That’s What You Said - Wilco. Existential American alternative musings. Another great band live. Profound sentiments from Jeff Tweedy.. So Danco Samba - Stan Getz. Much into jazz as I’ve aged. I love Mile Davis up to the late s. This track is gentle samba. Relaxing.. Prelude to Cello Solo No.  in G Major- Pierre Fournier. One of the most moving pieces of music I’ve ever heard. I feel unworthy when I hear it. It touches the eternal. . In the Hours - Emily Deloach, Incredible Grace. I listen to Christian praise a lot, it comes with the calling. This track oozes gratitude for the Gospel. Always make me thankful. I love City Alight songs and a Presbyterian praise group called Red Mountain.. Dig a Little Deeper - The Watson Twins. Smoky, sultry, southern Americana. Played this song driving through mid State Tennessee last year. Right song in the right place. Something like Lucinda Williams or Gillian Welch.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"martin rings the bell for the final time","story":"THE beginning of February will mark the start of spring and change for one West Belfast primary school principal as he prepares to retire.Holy Child Primary School principal Martin Short, himself a past pupil of the Andersonstown school, will hear the bell ring for the last time this week as he calls an end to the role that he has held for the past  years.“I started at Holy Child in September , I’m a local guy, came from Slemish Way, my three brothers came here, my sister went here, my three grandchildren are at the school now,” he said.“For me to think back then that I’d be the Principal of the school, it never crossed my mind but I’m so proud.”Martin told the Andersonstown News that he always wanted to teach.“I got that from the teaching and education I received at Holy Child, at St Mary’s Grammar School. The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"queens uni supporting the spar craic","story":"QUEEN’S University are the latest institution to show their support to the annual SPAR Craic K taking place on St Patrick’s Day throughout the city.Starting at the gates of City Hall, the route will take in the Gaeltacht Quarter as well as the prestigious university, Botanic Avenue and Gardens before the finish line at Ormeau Park.

Over the decade-and-a-half, the industrial and shipbuilding legacy that once dominated the space within the city centre has gradually been stripped away, as commercial and tourism industries shape the planning and development of Belfast.While some of the most dramatic changes over the years have been the development of the docks in the city, there have also been signicant alterations to the Cathedral Quarter, Victoria Square and the Ulster University site among others.Clare Mulholland is a professor at the Queen#s University School of Natural and Built Environment. She explained that the pace of change in such a short period of time can be traced to a number of factors including the de-industrialisation of the city and the legacy of the Troubles.Since the Good Friday Agreement and in the last  to  years there has been huge changes in the city, but obviously the urban environment particularly, she explained.The city centre has become a shared space. The best comparison for the development of Belfast would maybe best be to somewhere like Sheffield and Bristol.Ours was more pronounced though because it was people fleeing the city and living where. The urban environment of Belfast changed because of the Troubles.The regeneration of the Cathedral Quarter changed what was previously a very local area into a vibrant part of the city.What can happen with those larger scale developments is that they have great potential to act as a catalyst in the community.While bright new buildings and hotels have popped up, Professor Mulholland does strike a cautionary note about the importance of adequate connection and ensuring Belfast meets future challenges, particularly around climate change. Going forward, she believes we should have an eye on how to ensure the city is sustainable.It depends on careful city planning to make sure the infrastructure is there, she added. There has to be a focus on building a connected city. One that is accessible, particularly by walking and cycling routes.One thing which could be really exciting for Belfast is Stormont declaring a climate emergency, which creates a focus on what is good for this city.I am a big believer that Belfast could be one of the most beautul cities in the world. It is a really beautul size in terms of everything being in walking distance.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With  minutes gone in the second-half Claudy led by a point. With their defence beginning to get the upper hand the momentum was turning in their favour. Then everything changed. The Claudy bench asked referee Mickey McCarron for clarication on the scoreline. The reported - to - was instantly changed on the scoreboard to the officials - to -, in the Monaghan sides favour. googletag.cmd.push The winning margin was more than the two point swing and there was ample time for the Derry men to recover but the remaining theme of the story was of uncertainty. The young Claudy players lost their focus at a critical conjuncture and by the time Matthew Marrons nd minute penalty hit the net, their grip on the cup was almost gone. After the game, Brian Rainey hailed his sides spirit and although they battled back against the odds. For the most part, it was a terric contest between two well matched teams but Claudy will always look back on this game with regret. They will ponder how the game wouldve panned out had the score not been changed during their spell of dominance. googletag.cmd.push When you have team of young lads fighting for every inch of the game, they look up at the scoreboard and they have been docked two points, it is hard for those young cubs to take, Rainey commented after the game. Still, they battled on and still they gave everything. Unfortunately, that decision, which wasnt explained - I dont know how it happened or how it came about - I am just very frustrated that something like that can affect the game in such a way. Claudy carried the underdogs tag but a ninth minute goal from Niall McGonagle gave them the perfect confidence boost. Oisin Kearns-Madden won a kick-out and it was Tiarnan OConnors high ball that found McGonagle on the edge of the square before he slotted home. Matthew Marron, who finished with -, notched two early Blayney points but it was Claudy who held the upper hand and were full value for their - to - lead after  minutes. A mark, called by referee McCarron, saw Niall Rice reply for the Monaghan men who swtly scored again after McGonagle spilled a kick-out and Joseph McMahon passed to Rice for another score. An energised Castleblayney side were level though Marron before centre-back Liam Martin put them into the lead for the first time after  minutes. However, it was Claudy who finished the half strongly. McGonagle, who played at midfield for the second quarter, floated a perfect ball to OConnor who cleverly snaked inside the Blayney cover before firing to the roof of the net, helping his side go in at the break - to - ahead. Like he did at the start of the first-half, OConnor won the breaking ball from the throw-in but Claudys move broke down. It was Blayney who hit the first two scores of the second-half, from Rice and Marron. A touch of McGonagle magic from an acute angle saw him squeeze over a point before the Monaghan men hit the net. Dylan McKenna made the catch at midfield and at the end of the move, Rice raced clear. Despite the clutches of Ben Cooke, he blasted to the net, giving goalkeeper McCormick no chance. In the next play, Claudy almost found the net and couldve had a penalty. Adam Murphy passed to Niall Barr who squared the ball for the in-rushing Keelin Hasson who was impeded by goalkeeper McCully in the goalmouth. Play continued before Claudy were awarded a free in and Hasson was replaced with a head injury. McGonagles free tied the game once again. The Dungiven man then slotted over the bar, with a hint of goal on, and Claudy were back in the lead. Or so they thought. After the score was changed, Claudy were shell-shocked and Castleblayney took full advantage. Marron slotted home a penalty, with defenders Nathan and Zachary McArdle chipping in with points. McGonagle had a close range free blocked by a wall of Blayney players and OConnor saw a late shot blocked by keeper McCully as the brave Claudy fightback came up short.

The Christmasaurus by Tom Fletcher was a quirky read about a Christmas dinosaur and we both chuckled at the last line from lead character William Trundle. Itll not be long until well be penning the next Santa letter and on the journey home from Newry on Saturday night, I began to think how I would word mine. Dear Santa, can you bring me a long term plan that will provide high fetching midfielders to Derry. I have talked about it many times but now I am writing to you looking for something I think we really need and would get long term joy from. Signed, Sideline View. googletag.cmd.push I have said it over and over. There is no substitute for big mobile men in the games engine room. The systematic method of securing primary possession from short and strategic kick-outs is a brilliant development. I think back to watching Rory Beggan for Scotstown against Slaughtneil in Clones. Sitting behind Stephen Cluxton in Croke Park one day. The movement that goes into it must take hours. Its a craft. Closer to home, Thomas Mallons kicking against Leitrim in the league final last year. It too was an exhibition. People had said how quiet Michael McEvoy was that day, but the upper Hogan Stand view was a dferent one. The Magherafelt mans rehearsed runs were as selfless as they were vital. googletag.cmd.push The same could be said of Odhraacuten Lynchs ability to pick out Danny Tallon, Ciaran McFaul and Padraig Cassidy on Saturday night. Its a skill we should never throw away. The runs of Conor Feeney for Daryl McDermotts kick-outs the same. But what happens when the spaces on the flanks begin to disappear. In the closing stages, when diesel tanks in the outfield runners begin to empty and the dashboard lights start to flash, plan B needs to kick in. In Derrys case the worrying sign is that out and out midfielders are gone. Last year in the qualier clash with Laois, Derry couldnt buy a ball at midfield in the crucial final quarter and bowed out of a game they had within their grasp. The same can be said for the Leitrim game last week. Outside of Emmett Bradley pulling wide, there was no option of a leaping midfielder to pull off something magical. Niall Hollys four catches at midfield against Magherafelt in last years championship were just a memory. Conor McAtamney put in an exhibition of fielding at Glenullin a few years back. Holly is injured and Macca hasnt featured in the league. Sean Dornans catch on Saturday night got the loudest roar of the night in Paacuteirc Esler. “Good man Pat,” roared Down stats man Kevin McGuigan into his ear-piece in the press box when Pat Havern earlier plucked one from the clouds. Rory Burns got most of his kicks away cheaply early in the first half as Derry pulled the line back to midfield. As the half wore on and the Down keeper began to kick with more venom, the Oakleafers hoovered up enough breaking ball to leave them in control. Late on, despite seven wides, Derry looked like they would pull through. Then when Conor Poland scythed down Padraig Cassidy in full flight and got sent to the sin-bin, Rory Burns had only one option. And that was to enter the Neil Collins, Damien McCusker drive er as far as you can mode from the clashes of the s. Along with John OLeary, they were the best in the business. Derry didnt have anyone tograb hold of a game that was ebbing away without them really knowing it. I always remember Mickey C Conlan speaking of his get out clause. If he lost a pre-defined number of kick-outs in a row, Enda Muldoon was the next target. “Big Enda will always get it,” he told me. Slaughtneils Antoacutein McMullan was always able to play the Patsy Bradley card. In the Ulster final win over Kilcoo the Emmets retained  kick-outs out of . All strategic. One year on, against Cavan Gaels press, Patsy – almost licking his lips - was back in the ball game, plucking bullets from the sky as the route one was called again for. Callum Mullan-Young got lambasted in certain quarters after last years county final but when the game was in the mixer. He was left to crash and burn as Glen didnt have an out ball when Magherafelt closed the door on their plan A. In a few weeks when I pen my letter looking for midfielders, it is a long-term project, not a one-dimensional one. More like, bringing back the forgotten skill. Lets face it, we need it. Last week, one player with the desired leap, Conor Glass, was in Tasmania for Hawthorns pre-season training. With us haemorrhaging his like to the AFL, we need to build a wider base. We need toto square one and make sure we tick box number one. Adrian McGuckins recipe for MacRory Cup success, apart from the tough training and his before his time sport psychology, was simple two facing three. Across the pitch, the ball started at the side with three. The ball was delivered from wing to wing. Every two minutes the directive changed. Balls to the chest, one bounce ballsthe pitch was in decent shape and high balls. It covered all eventualities. “Get your arms up like the number ,”hed bellow, in reference to the need for outstretched arms. “Time your run, get your leading knee up and catch the ball at the highest point,”hed insist. Then it would y. Two facing two with a man in the middle for a minute of hell. Fielding high ball after high ball. Simple but unbelievably brilliant. How many coaches are doing it any more  Most people will wrongly say it is outdated but when the game is all about possession, you can never hone this skill enough. First touch is everything. What Derry wouldnt have done for an Enda Muldoon, a Patsy Bradley or a Fergal Doherty in the last ten minutes on Saturday night. Rory Burns would have to scratch his head a bit more and Odhraacuten Lynch wouldve been able to exploit his full repertoire. William Trundles Christmas list will most likely include a reunion with the Christmasaurus. Mine is a long term plan that will provide Derry with a better selection of big, lean, mobile players to play both cards. Peel to the wings for a short and fly through the air to collect a high one above the cluster...in a manner that inspires. Never run away from the basics. ALSO - Players should not have to choose.

Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre.

The -acre estate, which includes the derelict Boom Hall, stretches across a large section of land close to the Foyle Bridge at Culmore. Appeals have been made in recent years for more to be done to preserve the famous hall which is such bad condition that the land around it has been secured off. The new company, which has charitable status, is called the Boomhall Trust. It is understood that the new companys plans are separate from other plans which have put forward to transform the Boomhall site as part of the Foyle River Gardens project. googletag.cmd.push You can find out more about the Foyle River Gardens project here -http:bit.ly uoCd Boomhall Trust chairman, Jim Sammon, said the buildings and land on the site have been unused and ‘run down for the past  years’. “A restored Boomhall Estate will be a powerful statement of optimism and confidence in the future of the region, and send the strongest signal to everyone that five decades of decay are coming to an end in the North West,” he said. Mr Sammon said the Boomhall Estate is mostly owned by Derry City and Strabane District Council which has commissioned a conservation plan for the buildings and landscape. googletag.cmd.push He said the new company is consulting with the council on the options for the site. He added that the Department of Communities has also part-funded the Boomhall Trust to undertake an archaeological investigation of the site in partnership with the archaeology department of Queens University of Belfast. “Our intention is that Boomhall will remain in public ownership and generate resources for local communities to sustain themselves for generations to come,” said Mr Sammon. “As the place where the boom across the river was broken in , Boomhall is one of the most signicant battle sites in European History. “The landscape is also home to the biggest concentration of heritage trees in the city including many magnicent oaks. “We aim to protect this unique human and natural heritage and make it accessible for everyone’s enjoyment without spoiling it with inappropriate and intrusive overdevelopment. “We are proposing that the council designate Boomhall legally as a local nature reserve. This will protect the whole estate from inappropriate new build proposals which can be accommodated on other sites in the city.” Among the trustess of the new company are Pauline Ross, founder of the Playhouse in Derry, Jim Foster, formerly a senior figure in the Londonderry Development Commission, and architect Marie Donaghy was involved in the restoration of the Guildhall. Mr Sammon said the trust is currently developing ‘appropriate proposals’ for the conservation and on-going use of both the buildings and the wider estate for the consideration of the council and local community.

We are blessed in team Sinn Feacutein to have depth in leadership, from Vice President Michelle ONeill and our new chief whip, John ODowd.Since Stormont was reinstated, lots of things are learning curves for myself, but the mix of enthusiastic newbies and more experienced older heads in our group means that help with issues is never far away.Over the next two years, I am determined to see delivery for this area coming out of Stormont, and membership of these committees, Communities and The Executive Office in particular, will aid with this.

However, the persuasive powers of the members and their supporters eventually began to make progress, additional money was found, designs were modied and planning approval was eventually granted.He continued: Without the passion and determination of this board of governors my work and that of others wouldnot have achieved the success it did and now Limavady can look forward to having a state-of-the-art school which meets the capacity and needs of wonderful children that are entitled to equality of opportunity to address their educational needs. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was good to be with family to watch it, they were all very excited and the atmosphere was good.”The south Derry man, who works as a janitor at St Anne’s Cathedral in Belfast, said he was delighted to link up with Tom Jones but that he was relieved any judges had turned their chairs.“It’s a long six seconds that you have to wait before starting. You’re thinking ‘please, just anybody’ but I was over the moon when both Tom and Olly turned.“Going into it, I thoughtI could have anyone to turn it would have been Tom, ideally. I just respect him massively for what he’s done in his career and I thought he’d have great advice.”Tom Jones was thrilled to add Jonny to his team and tweeted on Saturday night: “Every team needs a voice like @BrooksFresh! Authentic, soulful and raw! That was very special. I am over the moon Jonny is joining #TeamTom.”By opting for the Welsh star, Jonny has put himself in competition with Brooke, who linked up with Meghan Trainor, but in a previous era, the two performers’ grandads were on the same side.Jonny’s grandad Roddy Gribbin was manager of the Derry senior football team that reached the  All-Ireland Final, while Brooke’s grandad, Patsy McLarnon, was corner back on the team.The pair also starred for Newbridge club side Sean O’Leary’s in  when the team took home the Derry senior championship cup.Jonny and Brooke have clearly inherited that competitive edge from their grandfathers, and both siners are no strangers to on-field success either. Brooke collected a Derry intermediate camogie championship title in , while Jonny starred in the Newbridge side who won the Derry U B Football Championship in . googletag.cmd.push Jonny was full of praise for his fellow Oakleaf contender: “Brooke has that big, bright, bubbly personality and everyone gets on well with her. When I heard her accent I said ‘you have to be from somewhere nearby’, and when she said she was from Bellaghy I couldn’t believe it.“You get a lot of time to sit and chat and because Brooke and I had that bond of where we were from we connected almost immediately.”Each coach needs to recruit  acts to bring through to the second stage of the competition – the battle rounds – but that number will be halved before they move to the next stage.Both Tom and Meghan will be hoping to channel the competitive streak of both performers’ grandads as they move forward in the competition, but the two Co Derry natives could yet end up on the same team.Judges have an opportunity to steal one act from another coach before the competition reaches the live shows and fans will be hoping the two County Derry stars remain on their screens for a few weeks longer. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This year, Craig Holmes, who works at the Savers Store in Lisnagelvin Shopping Centre in the Waterside area of Derry, has emerged as one of the top performers in the region. The event takes place today during Appren- ticeship Weekwhich is being co-ordinated centrally by the Department for the Economy and supported by Councils, education providers and training providers across Northern Ireland.Craig first began his apprenticeship in retail with Babcock Training, one of a number of private training organisations working with Derry City and Strabane District Council to provide employment opportunities to those keen to get on the career ladder.Since then, Craig has already gained the title of Savers UK Apprentice of the Year following his participation in Council’s ‘Get Paid, Get Qualied, Get Ahead’ apprenticeship campaign. He will now face competition from apprentices across NI for the title of DfE Apprentice of the Year before a winner is announced. The Awards recognise dedication to pro- fessional development and learning, and acknowledge the efforts of those who have made a signicant contribution to their workplace.Speaking ahead of the awards, Craig said he was thrilled to have been selected among the top talent in the region. He has found the apprenticeship scheme personally rewarding, fuelling his ambitions to complete further qualications and move up within the business.“I started with assisting customers on the sales floor, handling their purchases, helping to create window and in-store displays and stock handling,” he explained. “Since then I’ve completed a level two qualication and I’m working towards a level three qualication. With an apprenticeship, you get to see everything that the job involves. I’m now at supervisor level and really enjoy having the responsibility, it’s a great place to work.“It’s been a fantastic experience and to be nominated for the Apprentice of the Year title really is the icing on the cake.”Savers Superdrug area manager, Marie Graffin, said the apprenticeship experience had been a positive one for the store, and warmly acknowledged Craig’s contribution to the business. “Craig is such an honest and hard-working young man, he’s given his all and is a real team player in the store,” she stressed. “He’s always so willing to learn and to acquire new skills to develop personally and professionally.”Tina Gillespie, skills manager with Derry City and Strabane District Council, said: “I am delighted to see Craig’s success continue, he exemplies what can be achieved through the apprenticeship programme with the right attitude and determination.“The council is working very proactively with a number of education providers, private training organisations, careers service and companies to encourage people to avail of apprenticeship opportunities that exist across the council area. The promotion of apprenticeships is a key element of the education and skills outcomes set out in the council’s Strategic Growth Plan and overseen by the Education and Skills Partnership “The partnership was established to support the education and skills ambitions outlined in the plan. Along with our partners, we are supporting employers to secure and develop the skills they need to increase productivity, and enable iniduals to find fulfilling employment and progress in today’s competitive and dynamic world of work.“I want to take this opportunity to wish Craig all the very best in the competition and in his career, I hope to see many more young people following a similar path to success through the programme.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Today, Derry Credit Union – whose motto is “For people, not for profit” - has a staff of , over , members with shares totalling almost pound million. Last year,  new members joined Derry Credit Union, bringing its membership to , adults and , minors. At the end of the last financial year, members’ sharestotalled pound,,. As at September , the loan book was valued at pound,,. This is an increase of pound, in the year and brought the total of loans issue since the Credit Unions inception to pound million. googletag.cmd.push At its annual general meeting in November last, the credit committee reported that in the period from October , , to September , last year, , loanswere issued to the value of pound,,.. This was an increase of pound, compared to the previous year and brought the loan book to pound,,. The Abbey Street financial institution has a number of events lined up to mark its th anniversary.  Civic reception One of the first was held on Tuesday night last when management, committee members, staff and members attended a civic reception held by Derry City and Strabane District Council. googletag.cmd.push At the event in the Guildhall, hosted by Deputy Mayor Cara Hunter, tributes were paid to the “Derry Six” - Seamus Bonner, George Coyle, Paddyand Eileen Doherty, Paddy Joe Doherty and John Hume – for their “forward-thinking” decision to set up the non-profit-making organisation which, since its inception, has loaned out pound million to its members. Cllr Hunter said it was a “delight” to host the civic reception for the Credit Union. She added: “The Credit Union has enabled so many families and people to be on their feet over the past  years. It has been the backbone of the development of Derry. “Through the loyalty and dedication of its members, Derry Credit Union has flourished to become the success that it is today. I hope its success will continue long into the future.” Speaking to the Derry News, Joan Gallagher, Derry Credit Union general manager, said she was “absolutely delighted” at the honour bestowed by the Council. She added: “Derry Credit Union has been a very important institution for Derry and it is appropriate the council mark it with a civic reception. “This kicks off the start of the celebrations for the th anniversary.” Mrs Gallagher described the founders of Northern Irelands first and Irelands third credit union as “absolutely amazing.” She added: “I only recently realised how young they all were – Paddy Joe Doherty passed away recently at the age of , so  years ago he was only  when they started out on the road to developing the Credit Union. “I think Paddy Joe was one of the younger ones and having had a look at the ages of the others, there was none of them over  and I think Paddy Bogside was the oldest.” Looking to the future, Mrs Gallagher said Derry Credit Union would “still be here” in another  years and Brexit would have very little impact on it. She said: “Those guysgave us a gt and for those of us who are still involved, it is our responsibility to protect that and we leave it in a suitable position to hand on. I do believe Derry Credit Union will be here in another  years – for it is part of the city. “Brexit will have very little impact on us – the members have their shares, have their savings – we will still be able to provie the services we have. “We have invested a lot over the past number of years modernising the Credit Union. “At Derry Credit Union, you can come in to the office and do all you business or you can do all your business online.”Mrs Gallagher revealed membership at the Abbey Street office stretched far beyond the citys boundaries. She said: “Our members are not just in Derry – we have members in America, Australia and a number of other countries – we are a sort of worldwide organisation now. We have an e-banking  on which you can apply for your loan at night, we look at your loan application in the morning, we will send you an SMS text to sign and we will have your money in your account that day.”  Not a bank Mrs Gallagher stressed Derry Credit Union was “not a bank.” She said: “We will never be a bank. What distinguishes us is that we have  operating principles which we very closely adhere to. We are a not-for-profit organisation – the banks are for profit and they look at every opportunity to maximise afor themselves. “We charge an interest rate which is very reasonable and we have a rebate on that – once we cover our costs, we give back what we have left to our members.” Mrs Gallagher said Derry had become a very dferent place thanks to the Credit Union. She said: “Since our inception we have loaned out pound million –you take that out of Dderry, what would it be ” Colm McCauley, treasurer, said it was a “great honour and privilege” to be honoured with a civic reception, the first of a number of events planned to mark the landmark anniversary. He added: “There will be a number of events throughout the year and this is one of the first – it is great it is happening. “Hopefully, the Credit Union will grow. We dont keep our heads buried in the sand, we are always thinking strategically at how we can consolidate – we cannot just standstill and we do have a strategic plan to carry that on.” Mr McCauley pointed to the financial situations many people found themselves in at the time the Derry Credit Union was formed as to why so many in the city – over a third of its population – were members of the local institution. He said: “You need to go back a bit when credit facilicities for a large section of the population in Derry were virtually non-existent. The Credit Union was born out of that and it has grown ever since – it is not a profit-making organisation and any surplus goes back to the members.” Sean Hegarty, president, also paid tribute to the six founding members. He said: “It is virtually unheard of that a credit union established  years ago has achieved the volume of growth that Derry Credit Union has – it is very appropriate and we are delighted to be invited along to this civic reception. “Those peoplewere very young by todays standards and they took the brave step forward and had the vision for the benefit of the community. “It is a very emotional time. There have been a lot of people involved from the absolute origins, right through the decades to this very day. “We currently have a board of directors who volunteer and give up their time freely and willingly. “The world has changed greatly and the Credit Union has had to move to stay up with those changes.” Mr Hegarty said there would be a “lot of families” who would find it much dferent without the Credit Union. He added: “They would find it very dficult when it comes to key things in their lives, from simple things from birthdays to Christmas, to the education of their children, needing a bit of work done to their house, needing a new car. “I am not talking necessarily needing a big help but when they do need a bit of help, there is an organisation there for them.” Helen Kivlehan was one of the Credit Unions members in attendance. She said she has a member almost since its inception and revealed what her first loan was for. She said: “My father enrolled us as children and I went on to become an adult member. My first loan was for my wedding. My husband now and I were both members and we both saved in the Credit Union towards our wedding because in our day our parents couldnt really afford it. “We saved up and borrowed the money against our savings and then paid it off.” Mrs Kivlehan said Derry “wouldnt be the place it is now without the Credit Union.” She added: “It is a lesaver for people like my mother and father, who was a docker. “The Credit Union has been very good to me. I have been able to provide education for my children and my grandchildren are all now in the Credit Union and it should be something that is passed on.” Orla ODoherty, a member of the youth committee, encouraged young people to get involved in the Credit Union. She said: “It is a good experience and helps build confidence and to learn new skills.”  How it all began The Credit Union Movement was introduced in Ireland in  by Nora Herlihy with the support of a number of other dedicated pioneers. The experience of most people in Derry in the s and early s was that of high unemployment. Banks and other financial institutions did not advance credit without substantial collateral or guarantees - you had to be a homeowner in order to get a loan and very few people owned their own homes in the late s. Money lenders charged exorbitant rates of interest perpetuating the cycle of hardship. Consequently, the ordinary working class people in the city had only very costly sources of credit available to them. Derry Credit Union was founded by six iniduals whose commitment to their community is beyond refute. Six locals - Seamus Bonner, George Coyle, Paddyand Eileen Doherty, Paddy Joe Doherty and John Hume - believed the credit union could be a source of fair and reasonable credit for the ordinary man and woman. They met in a house in the Bogside on October ,  to combine their total savings of eight pounds ten shillings to establish the first credit union in Northern Ireland - and only third on the island of Ireland – a move that changed the fortunes and futures of generations in Derry people for the better.

Today, Derry Credit Union – whose motto is “For people, not for profit” - has a staff of , over , members with shares totalling almost pound million. Last year,  new members joined Derry Credit Union, bringing its membership to , adults and , minors. At the end of the last financial year, members’ sharestotalled pound,,. As at September , the loan book was valued at pound,,. This is an increase of pound, in the year and brought the total of loans issue since the Credit Unions inception to pound million. googletag.cmd.push At its annual general meeting in November last, the credit committee reported that in the period from October , , to September , last year, , loanswere issued to the value of pound,,.. This was an increase of pound, compared to the previous year and brought the loan book to pound,,. The Abbey Street financial institution has a number of events lined up to mark its th anniversary.  Civic reception One of the first was held on Tuesday night last when management, committee members, staff and members attended a civic reception held by Derry City and Strabane District Council. googletag.cmd.push At the event in the Guildhall, hosted by Deputy Mayor Cara Hunter, tributes were paid to the “Derry Six” - Seamus Bonner, George Coyle, Paddyand Eileen Doherty, Paddy Joe Doherty and John Hume – for their “forward-thinking” decision to set up the non-profit-making organisation which, since its inception, has loaned out pound million to its members. Cllr Hunter said it was a “delight” to host the civic reception for the Credit Union. She added: “The Credit Union has enabled so many families and people to be on their feet over the past  years. It has been the backbone of the development of Derry. “Through the loyalty and dedication of its members, Derry Credit Union has flourished to become the success that it is today. I hope its success will continue long into the future.” Speaking to the Derry News, Joan Gallagher, Derry Credit Union general manager, said she was “absolutely delighted” at the honour bestowed by the Council. She added: “Derry Credit Union has been a very important institution for Derry and it is appropriate the council mark it with a civic reception. “This kicks off the start of the celebrations for the th anniversary.” Mrs Gallagher described the founders of Northern Irelands first and Irelands third credit union as “absolutely amazing.” She added: “I only recently realised how young they all were – Paddy Joe Doherty passed away recently at the age of , so  years ago he was only  when they started out on the road to developing the Credit Union. “I think Paddy Joe was one of the younger ones and having had a look at the ages of the others, there was none of them over  and I think Paddy Bogside was the oldest.” Looking to the future, Mrs Gallagher said Derry Credit Union would “still be here” in another  years and Brexit would have very little impact on it. She said: “Those guysgave us a gt and for those of us who are still involved, it is our responsibility to protect that and we leave it in a suitable position to hand on. I do believe Derry Credit Union will be here in another  years – for it is part of the city. “Brexit will have very little impact on us – the members have their shares, have their savings – we will still be able to provie the services we have. “We have invested a lot over the past number of years modernising the Credit Union. “At Derry Credit Union, you can come in to the office and do all you business or you can do all your business online.”Mrs Gallagher revealed membership at the Abbey Street office stretched far beyond the citys boundaries. She said: “Our members are not just in Derry – we have members in America, Australia and a number of other countries – we are a sort of worldwide organisation now. We have an e-banking  on which you can apply for your loan at night, we look at your loan application in the morning, we will send you an SMS text to sign and we will have your money in your account that day.”  Not a bank Mrs Gallagher stressed Derry Credit Union was “not a bank.” She said: “We will never be a bank. What distinguishes us is that we have  operating principles which we very closely adhere to. We are a not-for-profit organisation – the banks are for profit and they look at every opportunity to maximise afor themselves. “We charge an interest rate which is very reasonable and we have a rebate on that – once we cover our costs, we give back what we have left to our members.” Mrs Gallagher said Derry had become a very dferent place thanks to the Credit Union. She said: “Since our inception we have loaned out pound million –you take that out of Dderry, what would it be ” Colm McCauley, treasurer, said it was a “great honour and privilege” to be honoured with a civic reception, the first of a number of events planned to mark the landmark anniversary. He added: “There will be a number of events throughout the year and this is one of the first – it is great it is happening. “Hopefully, the Credit Union will grow. We dont keep our heads buried in the sand, we are always thinking strategically at how we can consolidate – we cannot just standstill and we do have a strategic plan to carry that on.” Mr McCauley pointed to the financial situations many people found themselves in at the time the Derry Credit Union was formed as to why so many in the city – over a third of its population – were members of the local institution. He said: “You need to go back a bit when credit facilicities for a large section of the population in Derry were virtually non-existent. The Credit Union was born out of that and it has grown ever since – it is not a profit-making organisation and any surplus goes back to the members.” Sean Hegarty, president, also paid tribute to the six founding members. He said: “It is virtually unheard of that a credit union established  years ago has achieved the volume of growth that Derry Credit Union has – it is very appropriate and we are delighted to be invited along to this civic reception. “Those peoplewere very young by todays standards and they took the brave step forward and had the vision for the benefit of the community. “It is a very emotional time. There have been a lot of people involved from the absolute origins, right through the decades to this very day. “We currently have a board of directors who volunteer and give up their time freely and willingly. “The world has changed greatly and the Credit Union has had to move to stay up with those changes.” Mr Hegarty said there would be a “lot of families” who would find it much dferent without the Credit Union. He added: “They would find it very dficult when it comes to key things in their lives, from simple things from birthdays to Christmas, to the education of their children, needing a bit of work done to their house, needing a new car. “I am not talking necessarily needing a big help but when they do need a bit of help, there is an organisation there for them.” Helen Kivlehan was one of the Credit Unions members in attendance. She said she has a member almost since its inception and revealed what her first loan was for. She said: “My father enrolled us as children and I went on to become an adult member. My first loan was for my wedding. My husband now and I were both members and we both saved in the Credit Union towards our wedding because in our day our parents couldnt really afford it. “We saved up and borrowed the money against our savings and then paid it off.” Mrs Kivlehan said Derry “wouldnt be the place it is now without the Credit Union.” She added: “It is a lesaver for people like my mother and father, who was a docker. “The Credit Union has been very good to me. I have been able to provide education for my children and my grandchildren are all now in the Credit Union and it should be something that is passed on.” Orla ODoherty, a member of the youth committee, encouraged young people to get involved in the Credit Union.

The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district.Roads officials have previously insisted that the planned scheme will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety. In addition, officials are confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates that the bypass would provide a good economic .Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Cllr Walker argued that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has missed out on signicant roads funding for decades, with many major schemes constructed in other parts of the Province.ldquoI believe the time has come for this council to demand its fair share of infrastructure funding, he declared. ldquoI have been a councillor for over  years and the bypass issue has been raised during every one of them.ldquoThe government department has now moved to a position with all its ducks in this particular scheme now in a row. The public enquiry has been completed and the only thing delaying the scheme is funding.Cllr Walker said he believed that with the Assembly restored and a local minister at the helm of the Department for Infrastructure, the council needs to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon to seek the immediate release of bypass funding to not only alleviate town centre congestion in Ballynahinch, but provide a major boost for the wider South Down area, in particular, tourism.Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, described the market town as the ldquogateway to the wider South Down area through which all traffic must pass, including HGVs.ldquoThis not only frustrates drivers who are part of the through traffic, but increases tension and danger for those living, shopping and working in the town. The proposed bypass will run round the eastern periphery of the town with a grade-separated junction at the Crossgar Road, she continued.ldquoHousing is also being permitted up to the line of the planned new road and includes the potential for a park and ride site. The bypass has been proposed since the s and for decades local community and political representatives from all parties have demanded this new road.Cllr Mason said the new infrastructure minister must signal the start of work on the multi-million pound road scheme as soon as possible.She said that in , the then Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard announced his decision to proceed with the bypass proposal and instructed officials to continue to prioritise this scheme until completion unless instructed otherwise by a new minister. Cllr Mason continued: ldquoWith the infrastructure minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.She said the tender process for construction should begin as soon as possible, suggesting there is no reason why construction cannot commence this time next year, with the scheme complete and open to vehicles by .Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess is also keen to see work on the bypass get underway and hopes that the new infrastructure minister will also formally sign off the scheme to upgrade the final section of the A between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden in Saintfield.ldquoThe bypass is critically important to the social and economic regeneration of not only Ballynahinch but the wider South Down area, he said.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoIn addition, the A is the main link between Downpatrick and Belfast and while there have been ious upgrades, the section between Doranrsquos Rock and Rowallane Garden is simply not suitable for the huge volume of traffic which uses this busy road. Itrsquos upgrade is also a priority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th February 2020 Caroline.jpg","title":"Caroline’s love of Newcastle beach inspires St Patrick Centre exhibition  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE artistrsquos fascination with the townrsquos famous beach has inspired her latest exhibition.Caroline Williamson is showing over  pieces of her work throughout February at the St Patrickrsquos Centre in Downpatrick.Just opened this week, Caroline said that the exhibition is called lsquoShell Sounds from the Shorersquo.She said: ldquoOne of my fondest memories is walking down the Newcastle beach, collecting shells with my grandmother.

I usually use brushes but I can use my fingers, even sandpaper, and all sorts of techniques to get the finish I want, whether itrsquos inspired by the sea or the mountains.ldquoI was reared at the foot of the Mournes and that was where we would go to walk and to play.

The pick of those four has now been decided after years of exploratory talks and detailed investigations. Ironically, the final choice is of a route which dfers only slightly from one suggested by the  Downpatrick Area Plan.The new road will begin, effectively, from the entrance to the Meadowlands housing estate in Church Street and will run behind existing Church Street premises on a widening parallel, into the town centre.It will emerge onto the lower part of Scotch Street, across the rear of the Town Hall building and into Irish Street. Use of the present entrance to the new Irish Street car park will probably be made to swing the road through the rear of Market Street into St Patrickrsquos Avenue and on into the Ballydugan Road.KILLYLEAGH mdash A row is brewing in Killyleagh over proposals to open a pool hall in the townrsquos High Street.Angry residents in the area have drawn up a petition objecting to it being opened because they say that area has already suffered severely at the hands of vandals.Local councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, explained that  objectors had signed the petition because they were concerned that the pool hall would bring with it a sinister element.He said people in the immediate vicinity of the empty premises to be turned into a pool room were afraid to go to bed at the weekends and they fear this could escalate.Mr Osborne stressed he did not object to the idea of the pool room, he hoped it would take young people off the street, but he felt it was being sited in the wrong area of town.BALLYHORNAN mdash Plannersrsquo refusal to allow a new caravan site at Ballyhornan will have a major effect on Down Councilrsquos development programmes for the area, it was claimed this week.The claim was made by Downpatrick councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, who said planners were wrong to issue such a decision until a general development policy had been worked out.Mr McGrady also said he could not understand why there should not be potential for a new holiday location on the Lecale coast, where a number of such locations already existed.He stressed that in the absence of an Area Plan the council should have a policy on this.A planning spokesman confirmed there would be a policy on locations for caravan development when the area plan was published.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Mrs Margaret Atkins, we of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Humphrey Atkins, made a surprise visit to the Plessey Telecommunications factory in Ballynahinch on Tuesday morning.While her husband was at Stormont trying to thrash out the provincersquos problems in the round table talks, Mrs Atkins was having an extensive two-hour tour of the factory, under the guidance of senior Plessey officials.Mrs Atkins arrived shortly after .am and after a y talk with senior management, including Mr Harold Davies, regional director, and Mr Gerry OrsquoNeill, manager at Ballynahinch, she was shown around the factory.She met and spoke to many of the factoryrsquos -plus employees, sharing jokes and listening and enquiring about what kind of work was done.CROSSGAR mdash Sgt Matthew Cuffey, of st Crossgar Boysrsquo Brigade, has won the Northern Ireland Squad Commanderrsquos Shield at the annual squad drill finals in Omagh on Saturday.Matthew and the st Crossgar Company were representing Down Battalion at the finals, and although the squad finished third mdash three points behind hat-trick winners st Castlederg mdash there was some consolation in the squad commanderrsquos success.This very high honour for Down Battalion and indeed, has been won four times previously by Crossgar boys since the competitionrsquos inception in .Down Battalion officers were delighted at the results, and congratulations are extended to the companyrsquos captain, Mr R Dickson, and drill officers, Mr D Nesbitt, and to the boys themselves.DUNDRUM mdash The controversy over whether a section of lane way in Dundrum would remain open is almost over mdash and itrsquos now virtually certain that it will not be closed.Members of the Dundrum and District Community Committee were told of this at their monthly meeting in the Bay Inn on Tuesday night by the secretary, who read letters received from the estate agents and solicitors of the Lord Downshire Estate, who previously owned the lane.The controversy, highlighted by the Recorder last week, had flared up when local residents sensed Mr Albert Donnelly, the owner of the caravan sites on either side of the lane, which runs from Castle Hill to the junction with the Dromara Road, was preparing to close the lane.Pillars had been erected on the lane and residents were adamant gates would not be put up to block their right of way. The lane had been sold by Lord Downshirersquos estate to Mr Donnelly, but there had been some doubt whether a right of way clause had been ed.This has now been cleared up by the letters from Lord Downshirersquos estate agents and solicitors, who pointed out that the lane way had been sold but that the right of way was reserved.

When your partner is lying in hospital like that, all you want to do is to take the pain away but, at the same time, you have to put on a brave face for everyone involved.While the team is about football, Pat hopes that the members will be able to socialise after matches and share their experiences.Pat and seven of his friends are also fundraising for Sands by running in the Carlingford half marathon in March and the Belfast Marathon in May.He connected with John Fegan, whose family used to live in Downpatrick, on Facebook after John announced his intention to create the football team.John and his fiancee Kathryn Cole lost their first baby, Faith, at around  weeks into the pregnancy three years ago, although they are now parents to two children, Jude and Matilda.Like Pat, the  year-old knows the importance of physical activity and sport to help with mensrsquo mental health and being able to cope with the loss of baby in this way.He said: ldquoI was encouraged to do this when I realised there were other Sands football teams in Northern Ireland but none for County Down.ldquoThis is for fathers, uncles, brothers, grandfathers, cousins, whatever men who have been affected by the loss of a child.

But credit due to both Paddy and Alec for their performances against regular league players.Group four, headed up by Colin McKinty, always a dangerous competitor in competitions, but he had to contend with an equally talented player in Sean Poland, who has been in great form recently.John Campbell, another player who is in sight of a regular place in the Strangford C team and the affable Katy Rice, improving with every game she plays, completed the group.The first spot in this group was always going to be tight, but McKintyrsquos steady defence was the key factor in finishing top of this group with Poland second.Group four with Michael Carey having steered Strangford B to their third consecutive isional title, was the clear favourite to finish in first place, but would have to contend with the Drumaness No  Pat Mulholland, who has been in excellent form throughout the league campaign.Also in this five-man group were Michael Deery, team-mate Niall Houghan and Drumaness man Seamus McGivern, more at home on the snooker table, but still no stranger to the plastic ball.The games in this group were hotly contested, but in the final game of the group Mulholland and Carey would battle it out for the top place.The first game could have gone either way with Pat just edging home -.The next was equally close but, in the end, it was the Drumaness man who finished in top place with just five points the dference.The first quarter-final match was an all-Strangford clash between McKinty and McCusker.The first two games were shared, but the steady place of McCusker, mixed with well-judged attack, saw him take the next two games to progress to the semi-finals.The second match featured the Drumanessrsquo Pat Mulholland and Charlie Murray. This was easily the match of the round.Mulholland won the first two games, the next two went to Murray with a nip and tuck decider before Mulholland just edged it -. The third match of the round involved second seed Donald Campbell taking on his skipper Michael Carey.The games were all close, but the blistering attack of Campbell saw him progress in straight games. Vincey Poland had perhaps the easiest match of the round against new comer John Campbell.As expected, Poland had too much iation for his opponent and ran out a comfortable - winner.McCusker stated this competition a dark horse to a least reach the final.His opponent in the semi-finals was Donald Campbell and he started as favourite.This semi-final turned out to be the closest match of the competition. John won the first two games and looked confident to reach the final.Back came Campbell to even the score, but McCusker won the first four points of the game and held on win -, leaving Donald to reflect on a match he should have won when he held a game point in the first encounter of the match.The next match was a close affair, but Poland was always in control with Pat Mulholland delighted to have reached this stage of the competition.It was a gallant effort from the Drumaness man but, in the end, Poland booked his final place with a straight game victoryThe home crowd was pleased to see a local man in the final of the competition, but knew he needed to produce something special to beat a player of Polandrsquos stature.The games were close and John, encouraged by his supporters, did everything he could to stem the flow of winners from one of the leaguersquos best backhand exponent, but to no avail and lost in straight games.League secretary, Jim Ritchie, thanked the Strangford club for staging this event and providing refreshment throughout the evening and the competitors for their generous contribution to the charity fund.Competition referee, Peter Deeny, also acknowledged the friendly, competitive spirit in which this event was enjoyed by all participants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18181728.natural-gas-finally-arrives-west/resources/images/10992503.jpg","title":"bandstand malcolm mcdowell","story":"How long have you been performing Where do you perform What is your favourite song to perform and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What would be your dream gig Best moment as a musician so far What is the most unusual venue you have played What is your lsquogo-torsquo encore song Whats the best thing about performing Do you always perform solo or do you also play with a band What does  hold for you Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Luckily the cap was covering the needle itself, he said..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button ldquoWhat it contains and where exactly it came from, who knows  What is of great concern is the potential harm that this and quite possibly future needles might cause to unsuspecting river users.ldquoI would urge those who are using needles to dispose of them in the correct way before you cause potentially serious health issues to others.Rubbish found in River BannMeanwhile, despite gathering thousands more items of rubbish, Jon has been heartened at the show of support from the community and some local businesses.Jon has been critical of some who had been using the River Bann as a dumping ground but has been full of praise for several local business which are willing to pitch in and help.He revealed that the Norman Emerson Group Ltd have donated new skip bags to help with the clean up. He said: ldquoThe old ones that I had purchased were worn through and I was on the verge of buying more.Rubbish found in River BannHe added: ldquoJordyn from JD Tipler, who has been following the page for a number of weeks and is astounded at the amount of litter that has been removed from the river, has offered me a free meal for all the work Irsquove been doing. Jon also revealed that he had an offer from Dr Mowers Garden and Small Plant Repair.Jon has raised concerns about the huge volume of trash found and has been critical of some local businesses whose rubbish has ended up in the river.Last week Jon went to a spot used by anglers opposite Portadown Golf Club.New year, new do for Banbury landlordStorm Ciara: Met Office upgrades weather warning to severe Amber as disruption expected Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He said: ldquoIt has been in use for quite a while, going by the rubbish that has been left behind, and each time I pass here the amount increases.Rubbish found in River BannldquoThree black bags lted. I wouldnrsquot class this person or people as anglers going by the mess they have left. Irsquom sure there are more descriptive words that could be used.Last week he was joined by Campbell Best from The Y Zonewho noticed the work Jon was doing on the Bann River.Jon said: ldquoThese guys, as part of their detached outreach work, engage with the young people who drink down by the river at the weekends and, as part of their work, have been trying to encourage them to find other, more positive ways to spend their time and to make more positive le choices.ldquoIn order to help me, The Y Zone team try and encourage the young people to use the bins and clean up after themselves.ldquoWith the Hoys Meadow area being one place which has been used over the past few years as a gathering area for the Buckfast, Echo Falls and Dragon Soup crews, Campbell askedI could bring my dinghy along and help them with a cleanup of the area. ldquoHopefully, going forward, the young folk and others who use this amazing area can keep it clean and tidy, and fit for everyone to enjoy. Thanks to Campbell Best, Keith Whitmarsh and Warren Quinn from The Y Zone .John has had ongoing complications with finding the right department to deal with certain items he has found in the river, including dead animals. And he has voiced frustration at being sent from one department to another.In response to a query, a Department for Infrastructurespokesman said: ldquoThe Department maintains the River Bann on a cyclical basis to reduce flood risk and maintain the drainageof the watercourse.There are both rural and urban sections ofthe River Bann, that the Department maintains, with inspection frequencies ranging from every six years for rural sections to annually for urban sections.The urban section of the River Bann running through Portadown was last inspected on  January,  and no maintenance works were identied.ldquoThe Department does not have statutory responsibility for the removal of fallen livestock from a watercourse unless it is causing a signicant impediment to the flow of water. On designated watercourses the Department would only consider removing fallen livestock to the nearest bankit was causing, or likely to cause, a flooding problem. Such incidents where dead animals are found in a watercourse should be referred to the riparian landowner or the appropriate Local Authority.This week John discovered: , plastic bottles , glass bottles  cans  footballs  tennis balls  plastic buckets  black bags of rubbish .try catch  TrendingMan killed partner before killing and raping her teenage daughter in Newry apartment, inquest hearsStorm Ciara to batter NI with mph gales - weather warning upgraded to amber - possible impact on travel and electricity supplyBody of man found outside Antrim during search for missing Patrick Gibbons - post mortem to take placeThe funerals have taken place for the three McGinley children who were found leless at their west Dublin home last weekAlastair Stewart tweet: Julia Nightingale pays tribute to ITV news presenter forced to step down after social media error of judgement        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Latest News\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it.

She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
