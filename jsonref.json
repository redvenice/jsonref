The descendant of King George IV said he wanted a lady of the house who is happy with £50,000 a month pocket money.British oaks from some of the UK’s most famous estates could contribute towards the rebuilding of Notre Dame cathedral, following an offer from members of Historic Houses, the association for independently owned historic houses and gardens.So far more than one hundred donor estates, including Belvoir Castle, Hutton-in-the-Forest, Scone Palace, Castle Howard, Holkham Hall and Powderham Castle have volunteered valuable trees, planted for timber centuries ago, as a gift from the UK to France for the restoration of the iconic landmark’s roof, destroyed by fire last week.Calls for calm in Northern Ireland after \u0026#39terrorist\u0026#39 murder of journalist Lyra McKee Donald Trump spoke to General Haftar before US blocked British UN ceasefire resolution for LibyaDetectives release description of Trainspotting 2 actor Bradley Welsh\u0026#39s killerRowan Atkinson to sell his Mercedes 500E for the second timeUniversity\u0026#39s vice chancellor stripped of Ivy Club membershipMacron\u0026#39s polls rise to highest level since yellow vest revolt as French approve his handling of Notre-Dame fire\u0026#39It\u0026#39s not an invitation to some wedding\u0026#39: Afghan peace talks break down as Taliban reject excessive number of delegatesUK weather: Mercury soars as Britain braces for record-breaking Easter SundayLyra McKee: Journalist shot dead in Northern Ireland had \u0026#39found calling\u0026#39 in lifeItaly\u0026#39s public broadcaster under fire for separate channels for men and womenClash of Jeremys as Hunt tears into \u0026#39Marxist\u0026#39 Corbyn over austerity in fiery online rowBone which increases arthritis risk on the rise, scientists find, as better nutrition could be to blame Early elections loom in Italy as coalition partners accuse each other of corruptionNo fly in the ointment: the lotion protecting women and children from malaria Grassroots Tories withdraw support from party for European elections amid Brexit backlashPrime minister and entire government of Mali resign as Islamist violence surgesPc who said Adolf Hitler had \u0026#39never done him any harm\u0026#39 because they never met is dismissed from forceLargest-ever sewage treatment plant opens in Bangladesh refugee camp Cox\u0026#39s Bazar Comment: Binge-watching box sets makes us better people and more productive citizensPolice close in on Oxford Circus climate change protest, carrying activists away We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"binge watching box sets makes us better people productive citizens","story":"The latest series of Game of Thrones has only been released in weekly installmentsThe wonders of modern capitalism have produced no shortage of addictive temptations and one of the most ubiquitous must be the television box set.

Leaked details of the speech suggest he was going to announce tax cuts for poor households and a boost to small pensions, among other measures.Instead, he rushed to the famed Gothic building in central Paris and later promised to rebuild the cathedral within five years. A poll out yesterday suggested most of the measures Mr Macron was due to announce “answered” yellow vest demands, although the vast majority were angry at his refusal to instantly reinstate a wealth tax. Mr Macron is expected to detail the measures in person next week.The poll also found that 54 per cent of French think “yellow vest” protests should be put on hold in the name of national unity over Notre-Dame.Due to the fragility of the building and the risk of violence, police are to impose a protest ban on the area around the fire-stricken for Saturday\u0027s 23rd consecutive “gilets jaunes” protest.Despite this, police fear fresh protests in the French capital on Saturday with the interior minister warning “some people literally want to trash Paris”.A number of high-profile gilets jaunes figures have called for action with some outraged that almost €1billion (£865 million) was donated to rebuilding Notre-Dame while there was no such gesture for the poor.Yesterday the last artworks inside the cathedral were removed with art conservationists confirming none suffered major damage in the fire. In more good news, the 180,000 bees kept in hives on the monument that were thought to have perished in this week\u0027s fire were discovered alive.Please review our commenting policyKorean pop sensation BTS go to top of UK album chartsCalls for calm in Northern Ireland after \u0026#39terrorist\u0026#39 murder of journalist Lyra McKee Donald Trump spoke to General Haftar before US blocked British UN ceasefire resolution for LibyaDetectives release description of Trainspotting 2 actor Bradley Welsh\u0026#39s killerRowan Atkinson to sell his Mercedes 500E for the second timeUniversity\u0026#39s vice chancellor stripped of Ivy Club membership\u0026#39It\u0026#39s not an invitation to some wedding\u0026#39: Afghan peace talks break down as Taliban reject excessive number of delegatesUK weather: Mercury soars as Britain braces for record-breaking Easter SundayBaronet joins stately homes pledging oaks to Notre-Dame, saying he feels guilty for ancestors role in beating NapoleonLyra McKee: Journalist shot dead in Northern Ireland had \u0026#39found calling\u0026#39 in lifeItaly\u0026#39s public broadcaster under fire for separate channels for men and womenClash of Jeremys as Hunt tears into \u0026#39Marxist\u0026#39 Corbyn over austerity in fiery online rowBone which increases arthritis risk on the rise, scientists find, as better nutrition could be to blame Early elections loom in Italy as coalition partners accuse each other of corruptionNo fly in the ointment: the lotion protecting women and children from malaria Grassroots Tories withdraw support from party for European elections amid Brexit backlashPrime minister and entire government of Mali resign as Islamist violence surgesPc who said Adolf Hitler had \u0026#39never done him any harm\u0026#39 because they never met is dismissed from forceLargest-ever sewage treatment plant opens in Bangladesh refugee camp Cox\u0026#39s Bazar Comment: Binge-watching box sets makes us better people and more productive citizensWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 19 april 2019","story":"Climate change activists sit at Oxford Circus during the Extinction Rebellion protest in London, Britain Calls for calm in Northern Ireland after \u0026#39terrorist\u0026#39 murder of journalist Lyra McKee Donald Trump spoke to General Haftar before US blocked British UN ceasefire resolution for LibyaDetectives release description of Trainspotting 2 actor Bradley Welsh\u0026#39s killerRowan Atkinson to sell his Mercedes 500E for the second timeUniversity\u0026#39s vice chancellor stripped of Ivy Club membershipMacron\u0026#39s polls rise to highest level since yellow vest revolt as French approve his handling of Notre-Dame fire\u0026#39It\u0026#39s not an invitation to some wedding\u0026#39: Afghan peace talks break down as Taliban reject excessive number of delegatesUK weather: Mercury soars as Britain braces for record-breaking Easter SundayBaronet joins stately homes pledging oaks to Notre-Dame, saying he feels guilty for ancestors role in beating NapoleonLyra McKee: Journalist shot dead in Northern Ireland had \u0026#39found calling\u0026#39 in lifeItaly\u0026#39s public broadcaster under fire for separate channels for men and womenClash of Jeremys as Hunt tears into \u0026#39Marxist\u0026#39 Corbyn over austerity in fiery online rowBone which increases arthritis risk on the rise, scientists find, as better nutrition could be to blame Early elections loom in Italy as coalition partners accuse each other of corruptionNo fly in the ointment: the lotion protecting women and children from malaria Grassroots Tories withdraw support from party for European elections amid Brexit backlashPrime minister and entire government of Mali resign as Islamist violence surgesPc who said Adolf Hitler had \u0026#39never done him any harm\u0026#39 because they never met is dismissed from forceLargest-ever sewage treatment plant opens in Bangladesh refugee camp Cox\u0026#39s Bazar Comment: Binge-watching box sets makes us better people and more productive citizensWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/19/11/Extinction-Rebellion-emma-thompson-3.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3905566  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= 19 April 2019  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/19/11/Extinction-Rebellion-emma-thompson-3.jpg","title":"accountancy firms big four kpmg pwc competition watchdog","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

This cannot be allowed to continue.”Under the CMA’s proposals, competition would be encouraged by the introduction of\u0026nbspmandatory joint audits, which would force the big four to work with smaller partners when checking accounts.Big Four accountancy firms should be broken up, say MPsKPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY currently sign off the accounts of\u0026nbsp97 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 350 companies and 99 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 100 companies.Their dominance has led to allegations of a “cosy” relationship with some of the firms that they audit. Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee chair Rachel Reeves has accused the big four of using mundane audit work as a route to “milk the cash cow of consultancy business”.The CMA called for a regulator to hold company “audit committees more vigorously to account”, including public reprimands for those that fall short of adequate scrutiny from auditors.Lord Tyrie added: “Conflicts of interest cannot be allowed to persist nor can the UK afford to rely on only four firms to audit Britain’s biggest companies any longer.”Business groups criticised the CMA’s proposals, with the Confederation of British Industry warning that they risk damaging Britain’s reputation as a leader in the accountancy business.“Mandating joint audits will add cost and complexity for business with no guarantee of better outcomes,” said John Allan, the CBI president.“Operational splits could restrict access to the skills required to carry out complex audits.”Dr Ian Peters, chief executive of the chartered institute of internal auditors, added: “We welcome the proposal to separate external audit from non-audit services to raise standards, eliminate potential conflicts of interest and ensure the independence of external auditors to reduce the risk of another Carillion-style collapse.”Competition and Markets AuthorityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Numerous summary articles and ruinous posts are littered across the internet, and you might even come into contact with one without trying.That means that any fans should be advised to take proactive measures if they don\u0027t want to find out what happens in the film before it comes out at the end of the month.Thankfully there are a whole host of tools that can make it easier to ignore anyone trying to ruin 2019\u0027s biggest film for you.Created with Sketch. Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.With the potential to be the most frustrating of platforms – links can fly into your feed without you realising – it\u0027s helpful that Twitter offers built-in tools to make it easy to mute just about whatever you like.Every Avengers character ranked from worst to bestHead into the settings on desktop or mobile and find the Muted Words option. You can then add all the words you want, and they\u0027ll be banned from showing up on your Twitter, even if you then move to other devices.Last year, Facebook finally added the option to mute keywords, something that previously could only be done with fiddly extensions and a lot of work. The relatively new feature, called Keyword Snooze, is made for exactly this kind of situation.The unfortunate thing is that you\u0027ll have to wait until you see an Avengers: Endgame post before you can actually mute them, by which point you might already have fallen victim to the spoilers. If you do see something that includes keywords that you want to mute, you can click the option in the corner of the post, which will give you the option to snooze a selection of the words included in there for 30 days.Instagram doesn\u0027t let you mute specific words in your feed. Helpfully it\u0027s probably not all that likely that anyone will actually ruin a film through their posts, though of course it\u0027s always possible someone will post the leaked footage or some other annoying spoiler.It does however let you mute topics in the Explore tab, which might be useful, since they come from strangers and are so more likely to include surprises in them. Do that by long pressing on any of the topics that pop up there, which should let you mute that channel.Remember, too, that Instagram does have the option to mute\u0026nbsppeople, as well as topics. So if there\u0027s someone you\u0027re worried about spoiling it for you, you can head to their profile and select the mute option – either pre-emptively or in anger.It is possible to pick the nuclear option and, Thanos-like, remove the half of the internet that is threatening you with spoilers.\u0026nbspSearching through the extensions available for your browser should give you a whole host of options that will let you mute certain keywords, in a variety of different ways.Always be vigilant about doing so. First, you might miss important information if your keywords are chosen too widely: you\u0027re probably safe muting Avengers, but Endgame might get in the way a little more. And secondly, these extensions work by reading through the pages you\u0027re browsing on, so make sure they\u0027re made by someone dependable.Keyword muting and vigilance will only get you so far: the fact is, there are some people out there desperate to share spoilers, whatever the cost. And if they\u0026nbspare sufficiently clever about it, they are always going to be able to get around keyword filters, by using unexpected or very generic wording.The only foolproof way to avoid spoilers entirely is to leave the internet. But even then you are faced with the possibility that someone might mention something in person, or that you\u0027ll accidentally stumble into an annoying billboard or magazine cover...As such, avoiding spoilers entirely and without any risk at all might be impossible. It is probably best just to take the advice above and adopt a mindful approach towards anyone who does happen tor ruin everything for you.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s why they need such fancy salary and bonus packages.\u0026nbspBucher singularly failed to live up to the hype in almost every respect bar one: keeping Ashley at bay.\u0026nbspThere are still\u0026nbspplenty who will thank him for that but\u0026nbspit\u0027s probably not enough to save his retailing rep, at least in this country.\u0026nbspDebehams said that a search is now underway for his successor, to which the obvious reaction is to say, “good luck with that”.\u0026nbspHaving been through an administration process, the retailer is now owned by its lenders. In the short term\u0026nbspit still needs restructuring. That inevitably means store closures and job losses. In the longer term, they’ll want to sell it to someone. Lenders are in the business of lending to businesses, not owning them.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee chair Rachel Reeves has accused the big four of using mundane audit work as a route to “milk the cash cow of consultancy business”.The CMA called for a regulator to hold company “audit committees more vigorously to account”, including public reprimands for those that fall short of adequate scrutiny from auditors.Lord Tyrie added: “Conflicts of interest cannot be allowed to persist nor can the UK afford to rely on only four firms to audit Britain’s biggest companies any longer.”Business groups criticised the CMA’s proposals, with the Confederation of British Industry warning that they risk damaging Britain’s reputation as a leader in the accountancy business.“Mandating joint audits will add cost and complexity for business with no guarantee of better outcomes,” said John Allan, the CBI president.“Operational splits could restrict access to the skills required to carry out complex audits.”Dr Ian Peters, chief executive of the chartered institute of internal auditors, added: “We welcome the proposal to separate external audit from non-audit services to raise standards, eliminate potential conflicts of interest and ensure the independence of external auditors to reduce the risk of another Carillion-style collapse.”Competition and Markets AuthorityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average UK home cost £226,000 during the month, £1,000 more than a year ago but the slowest annual rise since September 2012.Despite declining prices in the capital, it remains the most expensive place in the country to buy a home with an average of £460,000, followed by the South East and the east of England, at £316,000 and £290,000 respectively.Across England, house prices in the North West grew fastest at 4 per cent followed by the West Midlands which saw a 2.9 per cent annual increase, according to the figures released jointly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Growth in Wales and the west of England was offset by a sustained fall in London and falling prices in the South East for the first time since 2011.”London again out of step with the nation as its house prices tumbleAverage prices in Wales jumped 4.1 per cent over the twelve months to reach £160,000 while in Northern Ireland, average increased even faster with a 5.5 per cent rise to £137,000. Scotland registered a decline of 0.2 per cent to reach £146,000 on average.The lowest average house prices are in the North East at £125,000 and is the only English region where house prices remain below their peak reached before the financial crisis.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY ITEM Club said the figures “very much fuel the overall impression that the housing market is being hampered as buyer caution amid already challenging conditions is being reinforced by recent heightened Brexit and economic uncertainties.\u0026nbsp“Although there are significant variations across regions with the overall picture being dragged down by the weakness in London and the South East“.He predicted a 1 per cent rise for the coming year but said he “would not be at all surprised” if they stagnate.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Counterterror officers are investigating the three devices as linked following a series of evacuations. One of the packages opened by office staff at Heathrow Airport burst into flames. Scotland Yard did not rule out the existence of other bombs. “The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags - have been assessed by specialist officers to be small improvised explosive devices,” a spokesperson said. “These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened. “The Met Police Counter Terrorism Command is treating the incidents as a linked series and is keeping an open mind regarding motives.”Large waves crash over the sea walls at Cleveleys near Blackpool, as the remains of Storm Freya, which has battered Britain with gales, heavy rain and snow causes widespread travel disruptionChristopher Hepworth with partner Tanisha Prince (right) on their way to victory in the annual UK Wife Carrying Race at The Nower in Dorking, SurreyPolice officers search near the scene on St Neot\u0027s Road in Harold Hill, east London following the fatal stabbing of a 17-year-old girl on Friday night.

The proportion of people in work is at its highest since comparable records began in 1971, boosted by an increasing number of women entering the labour market.A significant proportion of consumer spending growth has also been fuelled by cheap credit with growth in unsecured debt outpacing wage increases. New Bank of England data suggests borrowers will find it more difficult to access\u0026nbspnew debt in the coming months.Lenders said they had tightened their credit scoring criteria for loan applications in the first three months of 2019, with the proportion of loans being approved also falling.Interest-free periods on new credit card lending shortened significantly in the first quarter and further reductions are expected in the next three months.Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said the latest numbers were good news.“Even accounting for the Beast from the East, which kept shoppers at home a year ago, today’s retail sales data show households willing to spend more,” he said.“That reflects a slow recovery from a decade-long wage squeeze and, perhaps, a willingness to look through the apparently never-ending uncertainty that is Brexit.“Higher retail sales contribute to a picture of the economy beginning to show more positive signs. Growth is low, but falls in inflation appear over and real wages are rising, suggesting a little more steam in the economy.”Consumer behaviour is in stark contrast to that of businesses which are cutting investment as the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU remain unclear.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He still engages an audience’s curiosity and sympathy even when his behaviour is at its most selfish and erratic.” Geoffrey Macnab317 The House by the Sea“Guédiguian’s storytelling style is deceptive.

And Sats for Year 6 pupils are here to stay.Labour will abolish Sats exams in primary schools, Jeremy Corbyn saysIn fact, children in primary schools will also face a times-tables check next year on top of the already unpopular phonics tests under the government’s assessment system.So why do the controversial primary school tests still exist? Nick Gibb, the schools minister, argues that the exams raise standards and improve children’s reading and maths before secondary school.Ministers say that pressure shouldn\u0027t be\u0026nbspplaced on\u0026nbspchildren\u0026nbspas the exams are there only\u0026nbspto measure schools.Created with Sketch.Back to school: children attend class around the world Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A student stands in the ruins of one of his former classroomsUnicefClarke for UNSitan Doumbia, 5, plays with her friends at the Early Childhood Development Center in Mali330 Democratic Republic of the CongoTeacher Edouard Kabukapua, 28, accompanies his students as they sing on their way to their class in a temporary tent school in Mulombela village, KasaÃ¯ region, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

And the pressure has been passed down to the kids.Some argue that abolishing Sats would also make it harder for parents to know how good schools are at teaching core subjects, with these\u0026nbspresults used in league tables and Ofsted ratings.However, many parents are willing to have less information in order to save their child from the tougher assessments that leave many feeling stressed out.Standing up in front of teachers\u0026nbspwho have been disillusioned with the primary school testing regime for years\u0026nbspand calling for the abolition of exams\u0026nbspis an easy gig for Corbyn. What will be harder is finding an alternative assessment system that both parents and schools will back.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s a lot we don’t know about the origins of Easter, and we’re learning more every day.”It is not clear how, when or why the rabbit became linked to the Easter festival, although it could be due to the spread of Christian religious beliefs.The folkloric figure of the Easter Bunny bringing eggs for children is closely linked to German traditions.Additional reporting by PAOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canalThe Blood Moon, for example, appears red in the sky due to something called Raleigh scattering.This occurs when sunlight passes through the Earth\u0027s atmosphere and is the same effect that causes sunsets to appear red.When Friday\u0027s full moon appears above the horizon, Rayleigh scattering will cause the moon to appear orange to observers on the ground. The higher in the sky it rises, the lighter it appears.\u0026nbspMassive asteroid will pass Earth closer than the MoonThe moon also appears larger to terrestrial observers when it is close to the horizon thanks to the moon illusion.The reason for this optical illusion is still a matter of debate, though one of the most common theories is that the moon\u0027s relative size to buildings, trees and other objects on the horizon makes it appear bigger than when it is high in the sky and surrounded by the vastness of space.Another celestial event is also set to take place on Thursday, with Asteroid 2019 GC6 set to pass the Earth on Thursday at half the distance to the Moon.Unfortunately for anyone hoping to spot it, astronomers have described it as trying to spot a lump of coal in the night sky.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Goods bought from European countries will also have risen in cost because of the fall in the value of the pound,\u0026nbspmeaning the real figure is likely to be much higher.Companies appear to have borne the brunt of the price increases, with £4.4bn of the £15bn\u0026nbspin additional costs having been spent on machine and transport equipment. A further £2.9bn more was spent on mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials and £924m went on chemicals and related products.The analysis is based on data published by the government last week.

The average UK home cost £226,000 during the month, £1,000 more than a year ago but the slowest annual rise since September 2012.Despite declining prices in the capital, it remains the most expensive place in the country to buy a home with an average of £460,000, followed by the South East and the east of England, at £316,000 and £290,000 respectively.Across England, house prices in the North West grew fastest at 4 per cent followed by the West Midlands which saw a 2.9 per cent annual increase, according to the figures released jointly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Growth in Wales and the west of England was offset by a sustained fall in London and falling prices in the South East for the first time since 2011.”London again out of step with the nation as its house prices tumbleAverage prices in Wales jumped 4.1 per cent over the twelve months to reach £160,000 while in Northern Ireland, average increased even faster with a 5.5 per cent rise to £137,000. Scotland registered a decline of 0.2 per cent to reach £146,000 on average.The lowest average house prices are in the North East at £125,000 and is the only English region where house prices remain below their peak reached before the financial crisis.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY ITEM Club said the figures “very much fuel the overall impression that the housing market is being hampered as buyer caution amid already challenging conditions is being reinforced by recent heightened Brexit and economic uncertainties.\u0026nbsp“Although there are significant variations across regions with the overall picture being dragged down by the weakness in London and the South East“.He predicted a 1 per cent rise for the coming year but said he “would not be at all surprised” if they stagnate.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The proportion of people in work is at its highest since comparable records began in 1971, boosted by an increasing number of women entering the labour market.A significant proportion of consumer spending growth has also been fuelled by cheap credit with growth in unsecured debt outpacing wage increases. New Bank of England data suggests borrowers will find it more difficult to access\u0026nbspnew debt in the coming months.Lenders said they had tightened their credit scoring criteria for loan applications in the first three months of 2019, with the proportion of loans being approved also falling.Interest-free periods on new credit card lending shortened significantly in the first quarter and further reductions are expected in the next three months.Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said the latest numbers were good news.“Even accounting for the Beast from the East, which kept shoppers at home a year ago, today’s retail sales data show households willing to spend more,” he said.“That reflects a slow recovery from a decade-long wage squeeze and, perhaps, a willingness to look through the apparently never-ending uncertainty that is Brexit.“Higher retail sales contribute to a picture of the economy beginning to show more positive signs. Growth is low, but falls in inflation appear over and real wages are rising, suggesting a little more steam in the economy.”Consumer behaviour is in stark contrast to that of businesses which are cutting investment as the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU remain unclear.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But whats he been doing since  Heres the latest.The man who triggered the EU Referendum has been hard to find over the past months, as his successor Theresa May gets a drubbing in Parliament.That was, until reporters tracked him down outside his London home as he was going for a jog.Speaking the morning after the failed meaningful vote, Cameron told them that he regretted the chaos sparked by the referendum result.But he stood by his decision to call the vote, a move that has been widely criticised by Remainers.Cameron, who campaigned to Remain in the EU, was able to escape the Brexit blues with a family holiday to Costa Rica with we Samantha and his family ahead of the latest January  vote.Previously it was said that David Cameron was back at home writing his memoirs, no longer playing a role in Westminster.According to a friend, Cameron fancies being Foreign Secretary in the next government - but his current unpopularity makes this extremely unlikely.The Suns sources said: David is dedicated to public service, and has often said he wouldn’t rule out a public role one day, domestically or internationally.“But he is only , and still a young man.”The Camerons have properties in the Cotswolds and in Cornwall.Their lavish Cotswolds cottage cost a reported £.m, while their Cornwall getaway was bought for £million last year.They also own a London home in Notting Hill.They reportedly took out a mortgage on the home just days before the EU referendum.Recently, Cameron sent his -year-old son Elwen to a private school where fees are more than £,-a-year. Around a quarter of its students go on to Oxbridge.Competition for admission is fierce and in some years there are six applicants for every place.Speaking to the BBC on January , , Cameron said: Obviously I regret that we lost that referendum, I deeply regret that - I was leading the campaign to stay in the European Union.And he said he obviously was sorry for the utter chaos that the vote has unleashed on Britain, adding there were dficulties and problems we’ve been having trying to implement the result of that referendum.As well as writing his memoirs, Cameron has reportedly advised Theresa May on how to break the Brexit deadlock.The former PM has lobbied Mrs May to put a string of dferent options to a vote in Parliament.He has teamed up with at least eight Cabinet ministers to argue for so-called indicative votes in the House of Commons.Cameron has privately urged Remainer ministers to push Theresa May into a soft Brexit, The Sun has revealed.The former PM has been supportive of Mrs May in public.But MPs who have met him in private say he has been heavily critical of Mrs May’s refusal to seek a cross-party consensus to get a deal through.Big Daves had more time to turn his hand to normal things like cooking for his familyThe father-of-four had also been due to publish his memoirs in autumn  but decided to wait until September  “to avoid his comments on Brexit undermining Britain’s crunch negotiations with the EU”, according to The Sunday Times.Cameron has enjoyed trips to Glastonbury festival, chowed down on some fish and chips at Polzeath Beach in Cornwall and sported a Peaky Blinders flat cap at the races.He has also been giving advice to we Samanthas designer clothing business.Aside from writing his memoirs, Cameron has also been involved in overseeing the expansion of the National Citizen Service , the skills programme for teenagers he set up while in power, as chairman of NCS Patrons.The scheme is open to young people aged between  and  and involves outdoor activity trips, where young people learn le skills and plan and fundraise for social action projects.Cameron will bring together politicians from all parties, as well as industry experts, to help it reach more teenagers.As well as being on the board of several other organisations, the rest of his time is taken up predominantly with the UK-China Fund, which he has vice-chaired since December .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We demand the Government makes the following changes to help hard-working famililes before its too late. We want you to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Things have not improved for the former housekeeper, who has been forced to borrow money to pay for furniture and did not have enough cash to celebrate her eight-year-old son’s birthday.“I got my son a little truck for his birthday but that was it, she said. “He was happy to get something as I’ve had to sell the toys he has just to charge the electric and the gas,”Charlotte charges men £ for sex and other favours - bringing in around £ every week. She sees one client whenever she can as she appreciates the “regular” work.In fact, the mum feels so let down by the Government she claims her clients are the only people she can trust.Charlotte, who lives on an estate, had to give up her job when she had her son because she couldnt afford childcare.She moved onto Universal Credit in January  but fell £ behind on her rent while waiting for her first payment and was threatened with eviction.She says: “If I didn’t have to wait so long for my first payment, I would have been OK.“Something always goes wrong - five weeks is too much. I’m still just about managing now.“Winter has been hard, I’ve had to keep the house warm and the lights on, but it’s been so expensive to do.Her sons dad pays nothing towards his upkeep and while she received a £ loan from the government to tide her over when she moved onto Universal Credit last year, she claims she wasn’t told by her local job centre that it would need to be repaid.“That was the final straw when everything changed, and I saw how much debt I was in… the payments and the household bills, it all built up,” she says.Charlotte now receives £-a-month in Universal Credit after her rent has been paid to her landlord and her debts, including the £ furniture loan, are taken off.At one point, after shed paid the rest of her bills, she was left with just £. a day for her and her son to live on.Other women have also claimed that a long wait for their first Universal Credit payment has forced them into sex work.Julie, , from Merseyside told the BBC she had been left “so ashamed” after being forced to turn to sex work after an EIGHT-week wait for her Universal Credit payment.“I didnt go out looking for it, I said no at first ... it wasnt until about three weeks later that I said OK, yeah, because I thought I need to, because I need money’,” she said.Its something I never ever thought I would be ever capable of doing.”Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussell Trust website.Women like Charlotte are often too ashamed to tell their families that they have resorted to prostitution to survive.“I can’t talk to anyone. It’s the guilt mainly. My family don’t know - they wouldn’t be happy. They’d be angry, furious, upset. They would be so judgemental.My son still doesn’t know about what I do for money either.”“And I’m sure there are other women out there in worse situations than me.”Charlotte is struggling with her mental health at the moment and is having therapy for a second time – but she hasn’t admitted what she “does on the side” as she doesn’t think her counsellor would understand.She is considering going to college to do a course as she wants to be an author, but feels things are stacked against her.“I know I’ve got lots to work on, but it’s too much sometimes,” she says.“I keep thinking, why is this happening “They say Universal Credit is working, but who is that for Why are people getting poorer but the government don’t care  Evensomething changes, I can’t erase what I’ve done now.Officials say that advances are available from day one on Universal Credit - and that Brits can get up to  per cent of their cash upfrontthey need it.But delays getting the welfare payments are causing women to rack up debt and some are selling their bodies while they wait for help, charities have said.We know from the stories of women that have contacted us that the delays in processing universal credit and the drop in benefits is financially crippling.It is essential that the vulnerable are protected and their welfare is paramount.”A representative for Beyond The Streets, which works to help women who have suffered sexual exploitation, said: We welcome the investigation in to failures in universal credit and the increase in survival sex.In October, MP Frank Field shocked the House of Commons when he revealed women in his Birkenhead constituency were selling themselves for sex for the first time as a result of hardship caused by the introduction of Universal Credit.After The Sun shared Charlottes story with Mr Field, he said he would write to Department for Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd about her case.Here we have yet another awful example of Universal Credit pushing vulnerable mothers, who are trying to protect their children, to rock bottom and beyond, he told The Sun.The DWP insists safeguards are in place to make sure all repayments are affordable and sustainable.It also aims to give people help to find routes out of the sex industry, with personalised work coaches in place to help people looking for alternative roles.The department insists it has responded quickly to feedback on Universal Credit by continuing to pay Housing Benefit for two weeks after people move on to the new system. Other legacy benefits will follow suit shortly.Ms Rudd has responded to the Suns campaign, saying shes listening to Sun readers as she tries to improve Universal Credit for working families.A DWP spokeswoman told The Sun: We’re committed to getting help to people when they need it most, and advance payments and budgeting support are available.Work coaches are trained to spot vulnerable people, including those working in the sex industry, and offer appropriate support.”*Charlottes name has been changed.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Any blaze has destructive power. Yet the Notre Dame disaster leaves a greater sense of obliteration. Just look at the crowds of Parisians, many of them youngsters, who wept and clutched one another and sang mournful hymns as they watched Monday’s devastation.Their grief, and the awed horror of countless millions around the world who saw events unfold on TV, was not the normal reaction of onlookers rubber-necking at an accident. The loss of that old building left a deeper anguish. Why James Mates, reporting for ITV’s News At Ten that night, proved his value when he reached for an explanation.“Our time here is brief,” said Mates. “These structures — the greatest creations of mankind — are supposed to be permanent. Few can have imagined seeing one destroyed before our eyes.”These were good words. Notre Dame dates to the th and th centuries. To stand beside such an edice reminds us of our human smallness.The great cathedrals of Western Europe took centuries to build. Beside such projects, the longest human le feels butterfly-short. You run a hand over the old stones of a place like Notre Dame and you are struck by a sense of your own impermanence.You don’t have to be churchy to feel this way. There are other forces at work in our Notre Dame agony, emotions that a modern broadcaster might hesitate to mention. Notre Dame contained more than altars and crosses and pews.Its walls sheltered things far greater than the priceless artworks which burned. Notre Dame was a repository of the concepts of civilisation and nationhood and beauty and Christianity.It may be politically incorrect to say so but Monday’s fire, to many of us, felt like a metaphor for the recent conflagration of those precious moral concepts. French president Emmanuel Macron, who rushed to the scene, had this to say: “Notre Dame is our history, our literature, part of our psyche, the place of all our great events, our epidemics, our wars, our liberations, the epicentre of our lives.”Macron announced a national project to rebuild the cathedral because, “it is our profound destiny”. All this was noble and fair. But measure it against the record of the liberal political class he embodies. The Macrons and Merkels of this world — like the Blairs and Camerons and Cleggs and so many other equivocating cultural cowards — have long preached secularisation. They have diluted Christian values in our laws and public le.One recent Archbishop of Canterbury even told us it might be a good idea to have sharia law in Britain.These political leaders have imposed education systems that fail to teach youngsters to be proud of Western art and religion. They have scoffed at national pride and national flagsand lied to us about the federal element of the European Union.Out of sheer political dogma, post-war politicians bigged up modernist architecture, even though the public hated it. Much-loved vistas were destroyed and our capital cities’ skylines were wrecked when mayors approved show-off skyscrapers.We were told to be ashamed of past national historical triumphs such as the British Empire, which was allegedly racist and supremacist. Tradition was bad. Dferent was good. How come such leaders appreciate antiquity and the values represented by a great cathedral such as Notre Dame only when it has gone up in smoke One of the defining images of the Second World War was that photograph of St Paul’s Cathedral at the height of the Blitz, the dome standing proud amid Hitler’s bombs. The picture captured an idea of British defiance, of our country’s decency withstanding a Nazi dictator’s barbarism. It still makes one’s neck prickle with patriotism.What will we in future feel when we see that image of Notre Dame ablaze on Monday night  Might it come to represent the torching of Christendom in Europe It is said that the Paris fire brigade was slow out of the traps. Might that be a metaphor for a wider carelessness by politicians who have seen our culture in peril and failed to act It is no great secret that churches in France and other continental countries have been in a spiral of neglect for decades. A few years ago I visited a major church in Coutances, northern France, and found dead pigeons on the floor and broken panes in the windows.We have done better in Britain where, despite financial problems, our cathedrals and parish churches continue to be a great glory. The Church of England gets plenty of things wrong but it deserves credit for this.That Notre Dame and some of her treasures have been destroyed in Holy Week, as though roasted in the very fires of Hell, is a challenge to our already-dented morale. It seems cruel and may leave churchgoers agape as they try to identy the Almighty’s purpose.If God is working his purpose out, He has an odd way of going about it.But Easter is about renewal. Maybe that should be our pointer.Let this ghastly fire act as a spark to our resolve to relight a sense of pride in Europe’s Christian tradition.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This letter to the people of the UK was written in a police cell, where I was held for six hours.The information is from my memory, having spent the past  years following climate science. I have never been an activist, nor have I been arrested before.I came to London to join the Extinction Rebellion and was camping at Marble Arch and protesting at multiple London sites until my arrest on Wednesday afternoon.The Extinction Rebellion aims are: For the Government to tell the truth about climate change, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by  and to form a Citizens Assembly to determine how we achieve this.Preventing climate catastrophe is the most important political, social, environmental and technical problem humanity has ever faced.The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Changeis the United Nations body which assesses all available science related to climate change. It suggests a number of routes to limiting the rise in global average temperatures to .C. It also tells us that an increase of C will have much worse effects.All pathways to a maximum .C rise require cuts of around  per cent in global emissions within about  years. To have any chance of achieving this, we need to take immediate action to drastically reduce emissions.So far we have caused global average temperatures to increase by .C since the end of the s. We are already seeing the spread of wildfires, hurricanes, drought, melting icecaps, sea levels rising, ocean acidication, coral reef die-off and the largest scale extinction of animal and plant species since the end of the dinosaurs.The IPCC is predicting C to C of warming based on our current trajectory. With these changes, the Earth will not look like the one we recognise today, but rather like the planet of million years ago. Then there was no ice, temperatures were inhospitable and sea levels much higher — dferences that would totally destabilise ecosystems and society.As climate change continues, human-induced effects are amplied by earth processes, such as methane from melting permafrost and reduced reflection of light back in to space as polar ice sheets shrink. These processes will make global heating worse and are sometimes called tipping points, as they can lead to runaway climate change where the human effects are no longer the main drivers — and they are impossible to halt.Since human climate change was first predicted by Swedish physicist Arrhenius in , thousands of scientists, working for decades in dozens of countries and disciplines, have come to a consensus that climate change is real and the effects catastrophic. There is no scientic debate to be had.The Government is complacent about the UK’s emission reductions, while failing to meet its own targets.Given the situation, I feel the Extinction Rebellion is our last best shot at getting governments to listen and start telling the truth.Once the truth is being told I believe that YOU will be urging the Government to act fast and vote accordingly.My involvement in the rebellion and my arrest are my heartfelt attempt to do whatever I can to help prevent the worst effects of climate change and the social, environmental and financial costs it will cause.I am sorry for the disruption caused to local businesses and commuters.I also apologise to the politan Police for the ersion of resources. My experience of the Met is that there has been an atmosphere of mutual respect between them and protesters.I ask that you, the people, become properly informed about climate change. I also ask that Government, businesses and public bodies start taking transformative action now to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to zero.Finally, I ask for a Citizens Assembly, a representative group of the population which will determine the direction we take to get to zero carbon and will take decisions out of the electoral cycle and political and financial influence.The protesters in London represent a broad church of opinion but I would say my opinions and background are typical.If you have read this far, thank you very much.PIERS writes his letter from a police cell – and for that reason, I cannot take him seriously. He and his fellow protesters might think their cause is noble, but breaking the law is not.Equality before the law is one of the most important principles of British justice. The expectation has always been thatyou commit a crime, you will do the time.Yet for days now, parts of central London have been overrun by a rag-tag band of climate change activists, Piers among them.Setting up makesht camps at Oxford Circus, Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square, members of Extinction Rebellion have blockaded roads. And they appeared to be doing so with the support of the politan Police and the force’s boss, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.Their cause is an important one, but like every good hostage taker, Extinction Rebellion has come armed with a list of demands, and protesters are prepared to be arrested to secure them. Yet even Extinction Rebellion must have been surprised the blockades were not removed for four days.Hundreds of thousands of Londoners have been suffering on a daily basis. Commuters cannot get to work as buses have been erted. Shoppers have had to abandon some of the busiest streets. Businesses can’t get essential supplies. Emergency vehicles are unable to take the quickest routes. The blockades have cost London millions.Nobody denies the activists are committing a crime by obstructing the streets. Until yesterday, police could be found helping them by acting as picket-line cheerleaders and traffic controllers. We have been told the police presence hasn’t detracted from usual police business. Which of us believes that Excusing their behaviour because it is an important and righteous cause ignores the problem that we are setting a precedent.The liberal, metropolitan elite cheering on the protesters should be careful what they wish for. Paris has been convulsed by violent protests that began in a similar way. Failure to apply the law of obstruction when the Yellow Vest movement started has cost France dear.Others with cause to be angry about politics will have learned the lessons from Extinction Rebellion’s successful action.Remain-backing Londoners may feel very dferently about the taking over of public spaceLeave supporters annoyed at the failure to secure Brexit hit the streets in peaceful protest.

He was expelled when Corbyn was leader for rather delightfully tweeting: “Dan Jarvis can lick my f***ing ar*e too. Posing c***.”A shame no one was on top of that detail, as I thought it would’ve added to the debate they were having about “male aggression” ruining politics.No matter, because this week we had a discussion on feminism and the open goal of Frankie Boyle asking“the biggest problem for women is the determination of some men to be objectionable”.It is, Frankie. It is.As he well knew, though, there was fat chance of any of his guests being brave or bright enough to point out there was a big problem sat right in front of them.They all live in a wilfully blind, hypocritical political universe and will ignore any personal and professional failings, no matter how obvious and odious, just so long as the person shares the same common enemy and goals as the rest of this toxic, left-wing BBC bubble.Althoughcolumnist and environmentalist George Monbiot did rather let the cat out of the bag with that end- of-show rant.“We’ve got to go straight to the heart of capitalism and overthrow it. But you said this was going to be a comedy programme, Frankie.”Oh George, how stupid and naive can you really be QVC, Katy Pullinger to Michelle Mone: “I can’t wait to see your wedding photos.” Britain’s Got Talent, David Walliams: “Sheila Simmonds, you are a very funny lady.” And Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins, Jeff Brazier: “I think I might surprise a few people with who I really am.”Not unless you’re really Kirk Douglas you won’t.CHANNEL ’s three-part series Let’s Talk About Sex is a perfect example of a good idea gone bad.For it’s one thing holding up old sex education films for well-deserved ridicule.

It’s just part of le... so it’s a case of head down and getting on with it.May was appointed PM on July , .Back then, the BBC said her toughness has become her political hallmark.She regularly attends St Andrews Church with her husband in Sonning, Berkshire.May supported the UK remaining in the EU during the referendum campaign but was not a prominent campaigner.Her entire premiership has been devoted to ensuring Britain has a smooth departure from the EU - but its been a rocky road.She has survived two direct threats to her leadership, one from within her Conservative Party, and one brought by opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who tried but failed to force a general election.In November , the EUs  other countries gave their backing to her Brexit plan at a special summit in Brussels.It came after a number of cabinet resignations and calls for her to quit.The PM vowed to push with every fibre of my being hours after she pulled the trigger on a Brexiteer rebellion led by  Jacob Rees-Mogg which could spark a leadership challengeAfter the deal was approved by the EU, she made a direct appeal to the public in a letter to the nation.In her letter Mrs May said: “I will be fighting campaigning with my heart and soul to win that vote and deliver this Brexit deal for the good of the UK and all of our people.”But on December , , Mrs May cancelled the vote at the eleventh hour after realising she was sure of certain defeat.The chaotic Brexit negotiations led to her own D-Day two days later, when a critical number of MPs submitted votes of no confidence.On the night of December , an anonymous vote saw  Conservative MPs vote for her to stay, against  who voted for her to be ousted.Since then, MPs have rejected her Brexit deal for a second time - resulting in further instability at Westminster, and putting her political future in doubt.During a speech on Brexit in Grimbsy, on March , she said that months have been spent arguing about Brexit, when we could be focusing on improving our NHS, our schools and our communities.As Prime Minister, my job has been to negotiate the very best deal I could. Everyone now wants to get it done.She described the process as dragging on, but stressed that Brexit will not be a race to the bottom.May added that people voting to leave the European Union had voted for real change in our country.And it was a message to those in positions of power that for too many people working hard up and down the country, le was too hard. The Prime Minister is currently paid £,  a year, which includes the basic salary for an MP – currently set at £,.And being PM does have its perks - May gets a £, a year plush pad at No  Downing Street and free use of lavish Chequers throughout the year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but MPs rejected it in January.Theresa May headed to Brussels on February  with fresh plans to fix the hated Irish border backstop.And the PM also jetted to Strasbourg on the eve of her March  meaningful vote - which was rejected by MPs - in a bid to get further assurances from the EU.If Parliament cannot support a deal - and there is no extension - the UK will leave the bloc without a deal on March .That would mean the UK being treated as a third country by the EU with commerce governed by World Trade Organisation rules, experts say.Some Brexiteers say that could be positive - opening up trade with the rest of the world - but many people fear chaos.On January , Boris Johnson said that a No Deal Brexit is the closest to what people voted for in the referendum.He also urged Cabinet Ministers to mirror the British publics optimism and self-confidence for the possible exit scenario.A poll by YouGov on January  revealed that  per cent of the British public think a No Deal Brexit is likely,  per cent think a failed deal will result in a second referendum,  per cent said the deal will pass and  per cent said a better deal could be negotiated.The BBC said on March  that it understands that the UK doesnt intend to collect customs duties or have any other controls at the Irish border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Itll rely on self-reporting by firms instead.On March , Parliament dealt a major blow to Theresa May, resoundingly rejecting her improved Brexit deal just over a fortnight before the UK is due to leave the bloc.MPS rejected the PMs Brexit deal despite her assurance that new agreements reached with Jean-Claude Juncker in Strasbourg would ensure the UK cannot be trapped in the controversial backstop arrangement indefinitely.It means that Britain has been plunged into chaos -  days after the referendum, and with just  days before Brexit - as Brits are still in the dark about when, orwe will ever leave the EU.On March , MPs dramatically rejected crashing out of the European Union without a deal at any time and under any circumstances.Politicians voted  to  to reject leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement.But, its not a legally-binding decision, and doesnt rule out the UK leaving the bloc.MPs voted to delay Brexit until at least June ,  days before Britain was set to leave the EU as scheduled.Now, Theresa May would have to head to Brussels and seek permission from EU officials.Butfor any reason they deny her plea, Britain may leave the EU without a deal.They will discuss the matter for the first time together at a summit in Brussels on March .An extension to Article  can only be granted by unanimity among the  EU member states, and Brussels has made clear they will do so onlythe UK presents a credible justication for being given more time.The European Commission has warned Parliament that voting against Brexit happening without a withdrawal deal in place isnt enough and that MPs must approve the deal, too.An official from the EUs executive branch said on March  that the bloc had already reached a orce deal with May, yet the House of Commons rejected it – twice.The PM said that politicians are at the point where they must approve a withdrawal agreement in the coming days and ask for a short postponement to Brexit day, or request a much longer extension from the EU to negotiate a new arrangement.EU chiefs have only agreed to delay Brexit as long as MPs approve of her deal or  the UK will have to leave with a No Deal on March .Jeremy Corbyn said The House has definitely ruled out no dealBrexiteers say it would be a boost for the UK to be free from Brussels rules and we will be able to strike deals with other upcoming nations around the globe.We would also not be obliged to pay the £billion orce bill, according to a House of Commons report — but Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked fury by saying we would pay up even without a deal.Many people fear the UK economy would be hurt by a clf edge Brexit as trade is held up by new border checks and tarfs and more red tape for businesses.Doom-monger Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned house prices could crash by a third in a worst-case scenario.Customs checks on cross-Channel freight could cause havoc at ports, hitting food supplies and other goods such a motor parts.The Border Force is also planning for a possible No Deal Brexit as they fear there will be signicant outbound queues at the Eurostar and a degradation of border security, Sky News reported.In a pure No Deal Brexit scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.The  mile frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic could become a hard border, according to Eurocrats in Brussels.The EUs rules may require Ireland to impose customs and other checks to protect the bloc’s border – which some say would mark ato the dark days of the Troubles.It could blow a hole in the Good Friday Agreement, with pressure on all sides to find a compromise.The Confederation of British Industry also said a No Deal Brexit would wipe £billion off the UK economy, making every region poorer, the Daily Mail reported.Ministers have previously announced plans for troops on the street and emergency ferries to cope with a No Deal Brexit.They will order businesses and families to start preparing for Britain to leave the EU without a deal and release £billion of extra spending.Ministers also unveiled the post-Brexit immigration system, which will end preferential treatment for EU migrants.Theresa May’s Government was plunged into utter disarray over Brexit just  hours before a crunch Cabinet meeting over Britain’s future.In December , Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted Britain could “flourish and prosper”it walks away from the EU with No Deal.As bitter Brexit battles raged on:Businesses received a -page document about Brexit, with a total of , firms likely to hear from the Government.The papers showed:"},{"url":null,"title":"labour delete passover blunder tweet","story":"NewsLabour delete Passover tweet after people noticed an embarrassing problemThe party sent out a Happy Passover message to their Jewish followers -

Andy Walkden, who had  years experience, can be seen gliding above the coast near Southport.The picture was taken at .pm on Thursday April . A minute later the first  calls were made about the crash near Royal Birkdale Golf Course, reports the Liverpool Echo.His daughter, Kayleigh Worthington, said that seeing her dad looking so at home in the sky was a comfort. She said: Someone came to me and sent me a picture of him at .pm, the reports said at pm it was reported. This picture may be seconds or minutes before it happened. It all looks perfectly fine, it’s nice to seem he’s going into the sunset, that’s quite comforting.    Mr Walkdenaposs paramotor crashed into the ground close to Royal Birkdale Gold Course before bursting into flames. Fire crews, paramedics and police officers were seen at the crash sight with witnesses reporting seeing smoke coming from the area. The accident was initially reported as a microlight aircraft accident but was later confirmed to be a paramotor. Mr Walkden has not been formally identied by police yet due to the severity of the injuries he sustained in the crash.    Earlier this week his daughter, Kayleigh and son Aaron took to social media to share the news that their dad was the pilot involved in the crash.Kayleigh posted on Facebook: I just want to confirm that the person who lost his le is my dad Andy Walkden. I still feel like I’m in a dream and this isn’t happening.He still hasn’t been fully identied because of the severity of the incident but we know it is him. I just wanted to thank everyone for their messages, I’m sorry I haven’t replied to you all personally, I just haven’t had it in me until now. He was only  years old which is what I am struggling to come to terms with, he was such a skilled pilot and instructor and taught many people to fly over the years. He knew my thoughts on him doing this, and how I felt when he recently got the passion back and started up again, but it’s what he loved, which is what I’m trying to focus on to get me through this horrendous time in my le.    Aaron also posted a short message confirming the heartbreaking news and thanking people for their support. He wrote: I just wanted to thank everyone for your messages and I will let you all no when and were the funeral will be taking place. A paramotor is a motorised, steerable parachute that is powered by a motor and a propeller that is strapped to the pilotaposs back. Unlike a micro-light aircraft, a paramotor does not require a licence or any formal pilot training. The paramotor aircraft or its pilot also do not need insurance or to be registered. After the initial report that stated that the aircraft was a micro-light, all micro-light pilots in the area were accounted for.

He tried to get down the passageway but obviously missed and hit the wall instead. The neighbours helped him up and looked after him.

The pads are understood to discreetly weigh a passenger as they pass through the airport, collecting date which is then passed to the flight deck. Pilots would reportedly then use the data to calculate exactly how much fuel is needed for the flight and reducing the amount wasted. Other options are believed to include security body scan machines which could record a personaposs weight.    The move is said to also help reduce carbon emissions by using up less fuel. Currently, airlines use an average weight of a man, woman and child to estimate their fuel needs.For men, they allow . stone, for women  stone and for children . stone, reports the Independent .However, Berkshire-based Fuel Matrix reportedly claims this calculation results in fuel wastage.

I thought he had either motor neurone disease or multiple sclerosis, but all the tests we had were coming back clear. Things got so bad, Anwen used to drag her son up the stairs or help him shuffle on his bum down the corridor to his bedroom.

Neighbours Daniel Street and Lee Perry, both , tracked down the teenager and subjected him to a punishment beating after one of them vowed: Iaposm going to have to teach that little s**t a lesson. The victim, who had been cowering from the two men in a kebab shop in Denton, Greater Manchester, suffered bruising to his back, shoulder blade, face and head, along with two fractured teeth. He later told police he and his family have moved away from the area and added: This has affected my time at college and I have had to get dental treatment for my teeth. I am unable to go out as freely as I did as I feel in fear.    He continued: I stayed with my Mum four days after the accident for my own protection and I ed home to my Dads address after. Itaposs very stressful living in such close proximity with those two men. I have to be taken backward and forwards to college. I found the process of giving evidence to be distressing. Street and Perry denied wrongdoing and claimed the incident occurred following a break in at Perryaposs home. But both were convicted of assault following a trial and jailed for  months. Neither have any previous convictions. Sentencing Judge John Edwards told them: This was nothing short of a punishment beating on a -year-old lad with autism. I want to make it clear that you were not aware of his autism - however, you must have known he was a lad of  and you much have known how vulnerable he was.  He continued: He was struck to the face with a bat, striking the teeth and was said to be cowering in the kebab shop when unceremoniously he was pulled out onto the street and struck with a weapon causing bruising and abrasion and badly fractured teeth. A man eating at a Thai restaurant opposite recalls seeing both of you hitting him half a dozen times as he tried to protect himself. He was left with two fractured adult teeth, the left and right incisor, and he now requires root canal treatment and crowning. The hitting was described by one person as a stabbing motion. Whatever argument you had with him, you should not be dealing with the law in your own hands. This was a street beating where he was punched, kicked and struck with a metal bat. You, Lee Perry, were heard to say: aposIaposm going to have to teach the little sh*t a lessonapos and thataposs exactly what you did. You both thought giving him a beating would be teaching him a lesson. Immediate custody is unavoidable. The incident began at around .pm on September th of last year when the -year-old was getting a meal at the Denton Kebab Shop. Prosecutor Adrian Farrow said: He appears to have taken refuge in the kebab shop and the two defendants were seen looking for him. The boy has no real recollection of the events and he is autistic. His only recollection is being at home, then being in hospital. Both defendants were armed with a metal bat and a walking stick and they arrived at the kebab shop and saw the complainant inside. He was struck to the face by Lee Perry as he sat inside the kebab shop. Perry had use of a baseball bat. The complainant was then dragged out of the shop doorway where both defendants beat him repeatedly with their respected weapons.    He continued: He sustained bruising to his back and shoulder blade and damage to his two front teeth. He also sustained bruising to the back of his head. He was described as having intermittent confusion and was kept in the hospital for observation where it was confirmed he was made subject of a CT scan. During the course of the trial, the defendants account was that there was an attempted burglary at Lee Perryaposs home address and there was some disorder in the alleyway afterwards. The two defendants had armed themselves with weapons in order to seek out and find those responsible for what happened at the house. This was a sustained assault. In mitigation defence lawyer Robert Smith said: Both men in their own way, express some remorse for what they did. Daniel Street did say he expressed regret for what he did and he acted foolishly. Lee Perry expressed remorse in his pre-sentence report. Both grossly overreacted to what was going on and they werenapost aware he was autistic. The reality is they had both gone over the top. No matter what they believed that boy did, he didnapost deserve to be assaulted. For both of them this was a one off. This is the first time they have committed a violent offence.

Walsh then sent a message to Apsley saying: Was you proud of me coming all that way to batter that bird She later said: I was out my face on drugs when I sent that message.During the attack in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, Miss Hampson was punched by both Walsh and Apsley as she sat terried on a sofa. Her bank card was also taken and used to pay for Walsh to get a taxi home. Miss Hampson was left with bruising to her head, face and body plus scratched eyeballs, a cut lip and swelling to her face and a suspected fractured rib. She subsequently took an overdose due to her ordeal.    In a statement the victim accused the two women of having a capacity for evil and said: I have suffered from anxiety for four years and this incident had left my anxiety much worse and I have had to have my medication increased. At the time I was having fear that someone would come back and do it again. I am not sleeping very well. I fear going out on my own. I am not eating properly due to the stress and anxiety. Physically, I have a lump on my ribs following the assault. I am still in pain and taking painkillers. I have felt scared to stay at the woman refuge. I took an overdose four weeks ago and I have moved to live outside of Ashton-under-Lyme where I feel safe. I canapost work due to the high level of stress. If I ever saw them again I would be absolutely terried. I am scared of the capacity for evil they can have. Molly was supposed to be my friend. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Walsh from Adswood, Stockport was jailed for  months after she pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Apsley of Ashton-under-Lyne faced up to six months jail after admitting common assault but was freed with a  month community order after the court heard she was heavily pregnant and due to give birth to her first child.    The incident began on New Years Eve last year when Apsley and Miss Hampson met up for a few drink in their local pub. Prosecutor Craig MacGregor said: Starting at .pm they drank all night. Ms Hampson recalls being merry drunk, but was not falling over. Apsley invited a few people from the pub, including Ms Hampson, back to her flat to carry on. At the flat, Ms Hampson was speaking to some men in the bedroom, which was used as a smoking area. Apsley came in and asked to borrow Ms Hampsonaposs bank card to get money out to get some more beer. Ms Hampson agreed to this but then describes Apsley being aposgone for agesapos. When Apsley ed, she was with Gillian Walsh, who she called aposauntapos. Ms Hampson went into the room to see her and she had said something, but she doesnapost remember what. Without further ado, she got hit to the head. As Ms Hampson fled to the bathroom to get away from Walsh, three females followed her in. Walsh started to punch her repeatedly. Ms Hampson couldnapost get away until she dropped to the floor and slumped over the bath. Then Walsh walked away.  The prosecutor added: Ms Hampson said she wanted to be let out of the flat. She went into the living room and Apsley came in. The complainant sat on the couch and then Apsley punched her to the face, to her head and scratched her. Walsh then walked by the room and said: aposIaposm going to use the bank card to get money out to get a taxi homeapos. Ms Hampson was scared, hurt and just wanted to get out. She tried to phone the police but the third girl tells her not to call the police and takes her phone. The third girl then emptied her bag, took her belongings out and said to Ms Hampson: aposjust go and donapost involve the policeapos. Ms Hampson went back to the refuge and didnapost report matters to the staff but did tell the police. Her phone was used earlier in the evening by Apsley for her to make some texts. One of the replies to her read: aposWas you proud of me coming all that way to batter that birdapos. This was from Walsh and the Crown believe she was brought in for the assault. There was an element of planning and premeditation. Ms Hampson was a vulnerable person.  Walsh had five previous offences on her criminal record including a public order offence when she threatened a mother and her toddler as they were getting in their car and she said: Iaposm going to f***ing get you. She also had a previous conviction for assault occasional actual bodily harm in  when she got involved in a bar fight where she was seen to possess a kne, which was caught on the bars CCTV. Apsley had  offences on her record including assault whilst drunk. In mitigation Apsleyaposs lawyer Ian Metcalfe said: This was an ugly and repulsive incident and she is aware of that. But there was no evidence on the phone to suggest Miss Apsley summonsed Walsh. The text from Walsh is open to interpretation. Walsh who was unrepresented said: I am anxious and I have had some depression. I live with my son and my mum, my son has ADHD and has got some learning dficulties. My mum is  and struggles with her breathing. I was out my face on drugs when I sent that message. Sentencing Judge Tina Landale told the women: You have both pleaded guilty to assault on a lady who thought she was your friend. You Apsley were out on New Years Eve, you had a good evening, but something went wrong. After you got her back to your flat you borrowed her bank card to get some money out of the cash point to carry on drinking. You came back with Gillian Walsh, you had been using drugs and drinking alcohol. Things turned almost immediately as Walsh punched this lady a number of times and caused her some injuries to her face and her body. She wasnapost allowed to leave and whilst she was on the sofa you, Apsley punched her. These offences are serious. Both women were also made subject of a restraining order for three years, prohibiting contact with Ms Hampson. If you or someone you know is struggling with, there is help available.

One man, Ruben Enaje, was aposcruciedapos for the rd year in a row at the ceremony. Enaje, , portrays Jesus Christaposs crucixion and death on Good Friday in front of crowds of foreign and local tourists in San Pedro Cutud village in Pampanga province. Actors drove four-inch nails into both his hands and feet and lted him on a wooden cross for around five minutes. Enaje told reporters after his crucixion that he continues the tradition to remind the world about the plight of Jesus Christ, and said he has decided to stop after next yearaposs rites.    Two men and a woman, Mary Joy Sazon who was praying for good health and her motheraposs recovery from illness, were later crucied to wooden crosses after Enajeaposs act. A total of nine people in three separate crucixion sites took part in the extreme Catholic penitence, which the Church constantly rejects as unnecessary. Dozens of barefoot penitents whipped themselves and carried large wooden crosses in sweltering heat on Thursday as they participated in a ritual ahead of Easter in Asiaaposs biggest Catholic nation. Some of the men, wearing red robes with their faces covered and hands tied to the crosses, walked for hours along a highway in the northern province of Pampanga, about  miles north of Manila, the capital.    Others were half-naked, using bamboo flails to hit their backs, which had been nicked with blades before the ritual. The groups stopped to pray at several places along their route, while women recited religious verses. It is dficult yet rewarding, said sixteen-year-old Job Christian Ong, the youngest in his group of devotees, adding that he believed himself cleansed of sin after the event. He volunteered this year to continue a family tradition, he said, taking over from an older brother who is now abroad.  The Easter penance aims to secure forgiveness for sins, cures for illness, or blessings. We always pray for strength,health for our families, and thank God for blessings, said Roger Aquino, a -year-old village official who was among the penitents. People should understand that what we do is a traditionshould respect it. Re-enactments of the sufferings of Christ are a tradition in the Southeast Asian nation ahead of Easter, though the Catholic Church has always expressed disapproval of what it calls misinterpretations of faith.

Taiwanaposs Eva Air said it attempted to contact the man, who was never named for legal reasons, through a lawyer in the US but were told that he had died in early March while on a y holiday on the island of Ko Samui. The island in the Gulf of Thailand is popular with tourists and has a reputation for prostitution in addition to idyllic beaches and dense rainforest. The cause of the manaposs death is due to an unspecied illness.    Eva Air, which was plunged into a scandal due to its response to the incident, said it learned of the US nationalaposs death as it planned to formally ban him from travelling with them ever again. Cheng Chao-yang, spokesman for airline which only hires female cabin crew, said in a press conference this week that the company had decided to officially blacklist the tourist over the scandal on January . The visitor was reportedly flying from Los Angeles to Taiwanaposs Taoyuan airport when he requested that flight attendants help undress him in the business class lavatory.    He allegedly threatened to relieve himself on the floorthey did not assist him, claiming he was unable to wipe himself. The flight attendant claimed she tried to cover the manaposs genitals with a blanket but he slapped it away, and that he wanted the lavatoryaposs door to remain open - a request that was denied. Citing an injury to his right hand, the passenger then allegedly forced one of the senior crew members to wipe his backside three times, moaning: Deeper, deeper. It is claimed the man complained that the flight attendant hadnapost done a good enough job and forced her to wipe him again. It was claimed the man boarded the plane in a wheelchair and asked to be given a row of three seats in economy class due to his size.  The flight attendant wrote on Instagram that she “locked herself inside the bathroom, crying and vomiting, unable to wash away the stench of the man’s s***, Shanghaiist reported. In her post, she called on Eva Air to better protect its cabin crew, hire male flight attendants and prevent similar physically-challenged passengers from boarding unattended in the future. The passenger was scheduled to take Eva Air flight  from Bangkok to Taipei on May  before dying of an as yet undisclosed illness. Cheng said the airline would contact the touristaposs family regarding a ticket refund. He added that two flight attendants, who both claimed to have been traumatised by the alleged bum-wiping incident in January, are both on extended paid leave. The cabin crew members broke into tears at a press conference as they discussed the alleged incident and demanded protection for flight attendants. Eva Air has said cabin crew are now obliged to act upon the demands of passengers, including those requiring special assistance.

While injuries and a lack of game time before he arrived mean it will be next season before the best is seen of him, he’s still shown his quality.  .Mark Reynolds: Apps .Having suffered a serious knee injury last summer, the decision to bring the defender on loan from Aberdeen looked a gamble. Neilson showed his faith in the -year-old by handing him the captaincy and Reynolds has repaid him with a string of top-class displays.  .Charlie Seaman: Apps .Little was known of the -year-old full-back when he arrived on loan from Bournemouth and he came with little first-team experience. At times his form has been patchy but he’s done enough to show why the Premier League outfit rate him.  .Cammy Smith: Apps .Robbie Neilson had to work hard to persuade St Mirren to release Smith and there was talk of the Paisley board blocking the move. Smith had a frustrating loan spell at United when he was an Aberdeen player and his first few months back have followed a similar pattern.  .Osman Sow: Apps .United paid a five-figure fee to MK Dons for the Swede. The injury problems that hit him in down in England have continued and he’s managed only two starts so far. One was against Ayr United last week and he did show some nice touches.  ."},{"url":null,"title":"emirates-a380-inside-luxurious-double-decker-jet-as-it-comes-to-glasgow","story":"THIS is an inside

McInnes is disappointed the SFA did not give Pittodrie legend Alex McLeish the opportunity to see out Scotland’s Euro  qualying campaign.The SFA axed McLeish just  months into his second stint as national boss following a poor start to the qualying campaign.Under McLeish’s guidance the Scots secured a play-off spot by topping their UEFA Nations League ahead of Israel and Albania.However, he paid the price for a disastrous Euro qualying opener as the Scots crashed - away to Kazakhstan.It didn’t get much better as they stuttered to a - defeat of San Marino, rated the worst national team in world football.The hunt for a replacement kicked off immediately with McInnes one of the names listed by bookmakers for the post.McInnes has consistently underlined his commitment to the Dons and would not be drawn on any speculation on who would replace McLeish so soon after the -year-old was axed.McInnes said: “This campaign is not over with and that is what I am disappointed in, that Alex has not seen it through.“There has been a lot rumour and innuendo about Alex’s position before now.“I am disappointed when any manager loses his job, especially when he has only been in the job for a short space of time.“On a personal basis I have got to know Alex well in the last wee while and I am disappointed for him as a person.“I recognised what a true patriot he is both as a player and a manager. Alex has been fully committed in any role he has had to get results for Scotland.“That is clear.“There is always that tinge of sadness when that is the case. My sympathies go with Alex.”McLeish was confirmed as Scotland manager for a second time in February last year.His sacking was confirmed yesterday with an SFA statement saying the decision was “agreed collectively in consultation with Alex” at a Scottish FA board meeting at Hampden.Under McLeish, Aberdeen’s Scott McKenna and Graeme Shinnie were both handed debut caps and have gone on to win multiple caps.Kilmarnock boss Steve Clarke, who will face the Dons tomorrow, is one of the names in the frame for the Scotland job.McInnes insists it still remains an attractive proposition for any manager at the right stage of their career.He said: “ It depends on where you are in your career but I would think managing your country would have to be up there with the majority of managers as some sort of ambition at some point. Whoever goes in will be aware of the scrutiny and pressures of the job but also the rewards.“The reward of qualying for a tournament would be fantastic for a manager out there.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit navel gazing and naval support","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe fraught question of Brexithas been exercising the thoughts of our contributor Ann Thomas.Tarbert artist Ann imagines a time in the not-too-distant future when we might have to resort to unusual means to export goods to the EU.Down in Westminster our politicians continue to squabble.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"john crawford ardrishaig","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowShinty in Mid Argyll has lost one of its great stalwarts with the passing of John Crawford of Ardrishaig after a short illness.John, aged , died in Mid Argyll Hospital on the evening of Thursday February .John was born and brought up in Minard in Argyll.

He also served on their committee for many years.John had served as a policeman for a short time before working in the quarry at Furnace, then going on to be a very well-known driver with Gleaner Oils, which supported many of his shinty activities with young players in Argyll.John was a great organiser and acted as goal judge in a number of senior shinty finals including the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup and notably the Camanachd Cup Final in Inverness when Gordon MacIntyre of Oban Camanachd scored his famous winner at the Bught Park.John apparently retrieved the ball from the net and lobbed another onto the park for the re-start before presenting the goal-scoring ball to Gordon after the match.John is survived by his brother Jim who played for Glasgow Police and he was pre-deceased by his we Donella.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bank injects tens thousands pounds","story":"NewsBank injects tens of thousands of pounds to revamp Ayrshire branchGiant lodges application with councilShareByStephen Houston:,  APR NewsAyr High Street branch, Bank Of Scotland\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMajor investment is being made to spruce up the Bank of Scotland in Ayr.

Three cash machines to the right of the front door will be pulled out. Two will be placed on the other side of the entrance, along with two which are only accessible from the inside. The creation of this new secure area will mean another disabled access ramp has to be put in. New furniture and finishes will be incorporated throughout the banking hall.

And what better way to celebrate the religious holiday this year by visiting Ayr’s oldest church. Thought to be the oldest church in the town, St Quivox Parish, Auchincruive, is rich in heritage and history. Visible from the A, the ‘country church’ was originally a rural Parish church dating back to the late th   early th centuries. It has been a living, working church without interruption ever since. The Church of Scotland branch has seen many changes over the years. In , the church on the Auchincruive site was originally called Sanchar-in-Kyle and was described as a rectory. In , it was mentioned in connection with the founding of the Gilbertine Priory of St Mary at Dalmulin within the Parish and in  came under the ownership of Paisley Abbey when the monks left Dalmulin. At this time it was a Roman Catholic Church and after the Reformation in , and the movement away from Rome, the church became used for the Protestant form of worship.  In , a major restoration was carried out to the original long church with the addition of a T-shaped wing. A relic wooden ladle used for the collection and communion cups, said to have been presented in , are still in use today. The last structural change to the church was seen in the early th century when the Whitletts and Craigie Galleries were added above each end of the original long church. The outside gallery stairs, still in existence, speak of an older time when the landed gentry did not mix with the people seated in the body of the kirk. And it’s hard to believe that back in those days there was very much a ide among the congregation between rich and poor. But that’s certainly not the case now. Church member and Convener for Fundraising and Events, Margaret McConnell said: “It’s always been quite a poor church. “The members and residents were either miners or worked on the fields. “Of course, there were quite a lot of farmers in the area but they were the wealthy ones.”  Speaking of the upper central gallery, Interim Moderator Rev Ken Yorke said: “That’s where the lords and ladies sat. “There was a fireplace up there and the story goes that when the local gentry was sitting there,he didn’t like what the minister was saying, he’d get up from his seat and go over to the fire and sit and warm himself.” Session Clerk David McMahon joked: “We don’t have any original members left anymore.” Margaret has a long standing relationship with the St Quivox, Auchincruive. She originally went to the church as a young girl then lived overseas for several years. But she admits finding her aunt Elizabeth’s grave in the church’s graveyard brought her “back to her roots”. She said: “Faith is a journey. “I joined the church  years ago. “My family were local residents and granny came to the church every Sunday.  “They were from Whitletts and used to walk along the Low Road, but now that’s the bypass.” Her family sat in one of the galleries, to the left of the minister. She later married in the church in . And it seems ministry runs in the family for Rev Ken too, whose father was a minister at Prestwick South for  years. Rev Ken said: “It’s not all about the minister though– we have faithful people who help out. It’s a team effort. “People nowadays, their attention span doesn’t last for too long so I try to speak for a short time but get all the important parts across. “There comes a time more than ever where Christian people and communities need to come together– still do their own thing– but come together to further God’s work.” David added: “A lot of our work is trying to involve the community. “It’s about getting in touch with the people.” St Quivox Auchincruive will host Holy Week and looks forward to welcoming those who wish to celebrate the holiday.  Margaret said: “Hosting the Holy Week Services at Ayr, St Quivox Parish Church, Auchincruive provides a great opportunity for us to let everyone in the community know that the beautul old church is still open to all and welcomes everyone. “We would also like to extol the historical importance and the heritage of Ayr, St Quivox Parish Church, as two of its former ministers were Moderators of the General Assembly – one of whom, Rev Archibald H Charteris, began ‘Le and Work’ magazine and also founded the Women’s Guild.” And although very proud of their beautul and historically rich place of worship, the trio agreed “the church is the people – not the building”. Church members meet together and operate between Ayr, St Quivox two churches Auchincruive and Dalmilling Church on Dalmilling Road, Ayr on alternating Sundays. Holy Week Services will be held at Auchincruive each evening at pm until Good Fridayand Easter Sunday funwill begin at .am , with breakfast served in the Crypt at .am and Service start at .am.

But no action was taken due to a blunder.   The council admitted the mistake after the Ayrshire Local Democracy Service learned of the incident.   Laura McEwan who campaigned to keep the library open said the councilaposs paperwork error was of great disappointment to residents.   She said: Once again South Ayrshire Council make disastrous financial errors which come at great cost to our local community. After much campaigning, Coylton like so many other villages lost its library services and the building stood empty for many months.   She said the £, rent could have went to other vital community services and blasted council cuts at the Coylton Gala.   The mother-of two added: How can they justy raising the council rates while this continuous waste of money is allowed to proceed unchecked    A council spokesman said: “The council’s lease at  Main Street Coylton was terminated in August , annual payments of £, were made up to this point in line with the lease agreement.

People in isolated properties were on standby to run for their lives as the fierce blaze engulfed hillsides. Residents and anglers had packed up valuables and were prepared to evacuate at a moment’s notice overnight on Saturday. A major power line was also in danger of being engulfed before the helicopters doused the surrounding grass. The scale and speed of the fire - swept on by mph winds and tinderbox grass and heather - shocked rescuers. People as far away as Maybole had to close their windows as the smoke blew in. One resident said: “It was really, really scary. I have never experienced anything like it. The fire was everywhere and we were ready to leave.” And forest steward Archie McNeillie revealed: “If we did not have the helicopters I hate to think what have happened.” Ten square miles of moor, from the head of Loch Doon to the upper banks of Ayrshire’s water supply Loch Bradan, was destroyed.    Fortunately the nest site of the Loch Doon ospreys was nowhere near the flames. The main forest drive between Loch Doon and the Falls of Stinchar is credited with halting the fire’s spread south. At the one point it jumped the drive but the flames were beaten by the Carrick Lane river. Dead grass and several weeks of dry weather gave vast amounts of fuel to the fire. There is no grazing or controlled burning, which would have prevented spread, in the area. Flames came within yards of destroying the play park which overlooks Loch Riecawr. They wiped out a lecking spot for black grouse and could have claimed the lives of young birds, rabbits and deer. Fortunately only a small percentage of the valuable timber crop was damaged. Several fishing lodges were at risk of being in the path of the flames.  Forestrymen directed aircraft to dump the water, lted from Loch Skelloch, to protect these and other rural buildings. Archie McNeillie, area warden for Forestry and Land Scotland, was among nine staff called out to help at first light on Sunday. A staffer from Dalmellington was first to get called out to investigate with fire and police on Saturday night. But he said: “It was clear from the start this was bigger than anything we could handle. “The wind was so strong and we could not control it manually. That’s when we got the copters in. “The area is huge,  square kilometres.”  Archie, who starred in the BBC series The Forest with his sidekick John ‘Cool’ Coughtrie, said  per cent of the damage was open moorland. He said: “There are some trees damaged by the fire. “The fire was funnelling up the river from Loch Doon to Ballochbeaties and came into a pinch-point. We just couldn’t stop it. “The two choppers came up in the nick of time to stall it. Had they not it would have gone into the Tairlaw Plantation.” Earlier overground and underground power lines at the Loch Finlas side were under threat and the helicopters had to contain that first. As late as lunchtime on Monday there were still wisps of smoke rising but there was no fuel to make it spread. An incident command centre was switched from Dalmellington on Saturday to the foot of the road to Loch Bradan treatment works on Sunday. Wild campers near a car park at the top of Loch Doon are being hunted. Police will only officially say they are investigating but the blame is being pinned on three young men seen with a car next to a well-known trouble spot. A police spokesman said: “We are working with Scottish Fire and Rescue to establish the cause of the fire.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14418225.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_070319bypass_01JPG.jpg","title":"maybole bypass could create up","story":"NewsMaybole bypass could create up to  jobs, says the Scottish GovernmentThe official award of the construction contract has fired the starting gun on the long-awaited project.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsAn overview of the bypass route \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe project to build a bypass for Maybole could employ up to , it has been claimed.

The trainee paramedic was a size  and had a body mass indexof . when she was diagnosed with the disease at . At just ft tall and weighing st lbs, she was horried with the way she looked. Katy, from Troon, recalled: “When I look back, it feels like the big me with type  diabetes is a dferent person. “I was so self-conscious, and embarrassed to have type  diabetes so young and to have to inject in front of people.” Katy first attended a slimming group at , but struggled to lose any weight with it. And when doctors discovered her diabetes as she prepared for surgery to correct an underdeveloped jaw, she lost her confidence even more. She explained: “I was all geared up for the surgery. I’d been so self-conscious about both my weight and my jaw. I just wanted to get it sorted. “But, as the doctors were prepping me, they realised my blood sugar levels were sky high. The surgery was postponed as they ran tests, which showed I had type  diabetes. “Looking back, I’d had signs, like constant thirst, tiredness, and needing to go to urinate all the time, but I’d been too scared to go and have it all confirmed. “The diagnosis itself was devastating. I remember being shown how to inject myself, trying to do it and just sobbing, saying I couldn’t. “I then had to deal with going back to school and adjusting to this new le. I didn’t want anyone to see me injecting, and felt so embarrassed. “At that age, you just want to be like everyone . It was hell.” She went on: “I would eat rubbish – big plates of chips for lunch, then take-aways in the evening. “I did very little exercise too. I’d not long passed my driving test, so drove absolutely everywhere – including to the McDonald’s drive-thru most evenings.” Things changed for Katy when, in April , a Facebook post about WW – the new Weight Watchers – caught her eye. After initially trying out the plan, she was shocked to discover she had reduced her blood sugar levels to match those of someone without type  diabetes. She continued: “I saw these amazing before and after pictures and thought, ‘That’s what I want.’ “I knewI didn’t do it then I never would, so I contacted my WW leader Morag and went down to a meeting. “They explained how to use their SmartPoints system, which tracks food and drink to nudge users towards a more nutritious diet. “It made complete sense to me and I especially loved the app, enabling you to scan food in the supermarket and find out how many points it’s worth. “I’d tried other regimes in the past and hadn’t stuck to them, as they were so impractical. You can’t exactly go out to a restaurant and eat weight loss shakes or supplements. “But I liked WW as it didn’t bring attention to the fact I was trying to slim down. I could still eat the foods I liked, but it taught me about moderation and to stop pushing myself to eat when I was full.” Katy eventually hit her current weight of st lb and has never been happier. She no longer needs to inject insulin, she just takes two Metformin tablets a day – a drug often used to treat type  diabetes. The charity Diabetes UK says that though there is no guarantee that the condition has gone forever – it is possible to go into remission – and losing around kgincreases the chances of doing so. Katy now lives on fresh, home-cooked meals, prepared from scratch and hits the gym three times a week, where she does cardio and lts weights. She said: “My advice to anyone  out there feeling how I once did is just to take those first steps, go to that first meeting. “It doesn’t take long for change to happen. You can still go out, have fun and socialise too. “You don’t need to stop your le in order to feel dferent.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr NewsAyrBMIFacebookSupermarketsEducationSocial mediaTroon"},{"url":null,"title":"greggs-submits-plans-to-develop-galashiels-eyesore","story":"GREGGS has submitted an application to develop a Galashiels eyesore.The bakery chain is hoping to open a new store at the former Ozkans Grill takeaway in Market Street.Andsuccessful, it would have an outdoor seating area for customers.Over the last few months, the town centre site has been targeted by vandals.Since the takeaway closed, windows have been smashed and the store front covered with graffiti.But proposals submitted to Scottish Borders Council this week show Greggs is hoping to give the unit a facelt and would install four tables and  chairs in the outdoor seating area.The chain, which was launched in Newcastle in , has around , shops nationwide including one in Channel Street.However, it is not yet clearthat would remain openthe plans were given the go-ahead.The firm also has stores in Hawick, Kelso and Peebles.The Borderhas contacted Greggs for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"housebuilder-apologises-after-admitting-responsibility-for-defective-peebles-homes","story":"ONE of the countrys largest housebuilding firms has finally issued an apology to Peebles homeowners.For over two years seven families living on the Kingsmeadows development have been battling with the builders over defects caused by crumbling mortar.Earlier this year Taylor Wimpey acknowledged, as part of its full year results statement, concerns regarding mortar durability and added that a \"robust technical solution\" to fix the problem had been identied.Work has already started on the affected  properties and this week, the company offered an apology.A Taylor Wimpey spokesperson told the Peeblesshire News: ldquoWe sincerely apologise to the affected homeowners for the issues that they have experienced within some homes at our Kingsmeadow development in Peebles.\"While a signicant number of houses on the development are unaffected by mortar issues, a robust technical solution to fix the durability of the mortar has been identied, which is supported by our appointed structural engineer, an independent review by the Scottish Borders Council, and the National House Building Council.\"We have a clear plan in place to remediate affected homes and works have already begun on the development.Problems first emerged with houses on the Kingsmeadows development in .Scottish Borders Councils building standards officers were contacted as well as Taylor Wimpey.The developer bought back several properties from householders after faults were identied.Non-disclosure agreements prevented the families from discussing the issues.In  more concerns were raised with the local authority over public safety on the development.And Tracey Logan, chief executive of Scottish Borders Council, called a meeting with Taylor Wimpey bosses where it was agreed for an independent structural engineer to carry out surveys.Although no structural issues were identied during the surveys of randomly selected properties the developer acknowledged there were problems with mortar on some houses.And towards the end of last year they sent out letters offering to carry out remedial action.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council told us: \"The first public safety concerns were raised with the council in late .\"In response to these concerns, the Chief Executive requested a meeting with Taylor Wimpey to investigate the concerns.\"At this meeting, it was agreed that an independent structural engineer would be commissioned to carry out structural surveys in a number of randomly selected properties.\"This was carried out in summer .\"The council did not have an official role in this process, but it was considered important to provide an independent opinion on the situation to ensure that any concerns were identied and addressed effectively and consider whether there was any public safety risk.\"The report identied no structural issues with the inspected houses and was satisfied with Taylor Wimpeyrsquos proposed remedial action to repair potential defects,required, andthe owners wished to take up this offer, which we understand a number of residents have.\"A BBC investigations team identied that the Peebles housing development was one of  across the country where inferior mortar had been used.Sheila Chalmers and her husband recruited their own structural engineers to carry out assessments on their Peebles home -

We learnt that smallpox dates back to before , BC and came from the Middle East, that Pharaoh Rameses V died in , BC of smallpox. Isabel mentioned lots of other people well-known to history who suffered from smallpox or died of it, including Saint Nicasius, Bishop of Rheims, who, though he was decapitated by the invading Vandals in  AD, in the cathedral he founded, picked up his head and walked to the altar, reciting a psalm. He is the patron saint of smallpox victims.It was called smallpox in the th century to dferentiate it from syphilis, which at that time was known as the great pox. It is a crowd disease that passed by inhalation, though can stay active on clothes, blankets and other objects. So the North American Indian tribes, the Aztecs and the Incas were devastated by smallpox, and the native tribes in Canada were infected by missionaries and priests possibly through donations of bedding or clothes. Itrsquos clear that smallpox was a major disease in Europe from at least the th century, killing at least , people each year and leaving visible evidence of the disease on the faces of millions of others. Smallpox seems to have been taken as inevitable right up until the mid-th century in Britain and only a few lucky iniduals came through it, unspoilt. The Chinese had a defence against it, more than , years ago, by blowing powdered smallpox scabs up the noses of healthy people ndash a form of inoculation. Though reports of this practice reached London in , it wasnrsquot accepted by the medical profession and it was almost  years before Edward Jenner demonstrated the effectiveness of using cowpox to protect people from smallpox.Wikipedia lists six th century acts about vaccination, though itrsquos not clear whether they all affected Scotland: in , making it available free of charge in , making it compulsory for every healthy child the ,  and  acts extending the requirement for children to be compulsorily vaccinated the  act while guaranteeing the right of parents to choose whether to have their baby vaccinated, effectively made it very dficult to avoid.

Through our Home and Belonging initiative, we are investing in projects which offer creative and personalised responses to this challenge.The pound million lsquoHome and Belongingrsquo initiative, which granted the funds for the Peer Flatmate Scheme, was created to provide specic and creative support to young people who are ready to move on from care, and to give them a feeling of stability, warmth and security.A spokesperson from East Lothian Council said: ldquoWe believe this is the first project of this kind in the whole of Scotland and a great example of partnership working between council teams and external partners to make a real dference to the lives of some of our most vulnerable young people. The role of a Peer Flatmate will be to provide guidance and share their experience of shared living. This role is voluntary, with rent and costs such as WiFi covered through funding. A Housing Support provider will provide inidual and group support to each flat-share project, covering issues such as budgeting and shared living."},{"url":null,"title":"volunteers-from-dunbars-rnli-honoured","story":"Volunteers past and present, in roles ranging from leboat fundraisers and committee members to shop workers and crew, were recognised for their ldquooutstanding service.On a special night that brought Dunbarrsquos leboat family together, presentations were made to  volunteers who have contributed to the running and support of the townrsquos leboats over many years on behalf of Dunbar leboat management group, the leboat fundraising committee and the crew.Mark Lees, chairman of the leboat management group, said the event, which was held at the townrsquos Royal British Legion, was about expressing appreciation to the service that volunteers from all walks of le had made to the Dunbar community.He added: ldquoThe crew might be the ones out there keeping people safe but they would not be able to do what they do without the support of everyone .ldquoWe all share a long history with the leboat station in Dunbar.ldquoWhat we have here is so very special.ldquoThatrsquos what makes the town of Dunbar such an amazing place.Ken Headley, who manages the townrsquos two leboat shops, said that the work of volunteers had helped make Dunbarrsquos High Street store number one in Scotland and among the top  performing shops in the UK.Presenting awards on behalf of the fundraising committee, Veronica Davies, chairwoman, said her volunteers continued to break records, with her team helping to raise more than pound, last year, including a best-ever leboat fete, which raised pound,, and Strictly for the Leboats ndash a weekend of dancing fun ndash which raised pound,.She added: ldquoThank you to everyone on the fundraising committee for all your hard work.

A local tradition claims that the name Markle is actually a corruption of the word miracle, a reference to this legendary intervention of the saint on that day.This event is now seen as the lsquobirth of the Scottish flagrsquo, the Saltire thereafter becoming the flag of Scotland the tale is well told by the Scottish Flag Trust in the doocot by Athelstaneford Kirk, which has been wonderfully adapted into the Flag Heritage Centre.But why was it St Andrew who came to the aid of the Picts and Scots on that day and not, say, St Columba  The answer to this question may begin in a ,-year-old crypt in Northumberland.This crypt lies underneath the abbey of Hexham, a town in northern England. The crypt is an amazing survival from Anglo-Saxon times, built in the seventh century, more than  years before the Battle of Athelstaneford is said to have taken place.The crypt was part of a monastery built on the orders of the then abbot Wilfrid and it had a special purpose.Wilfrid was a passionate devotee of St Andrew. He had travelled to Rome and ed with a relic connected to the saint. Christianity at this time had not yet fully established its dominance, and Wilfrid was determined to create a great Christian holy site to encourage the spread of his faith.And what better way to do this than use a relic of St Andrew, an Apostle of Jesus himself So he established St Andrewrsquos monastery at Hexham in AD , and in the crypt below there was a shrine, in which the relic of the saint was kept.Pilgrims began to flock to the site and, although small, the design of the crypt gave an intense religious experience.The entrance was by the high altar of the church, with dark passageways for the pilgrims to file towards and pay homage to the relic of St Andrew.Even today, the now-empty shrine has the atmosphere of a sacred inner sanctum. The ancient feel of it is added to by the fact it was constructed with stones taken from abandoned Roman buildings, as Hexham is close to Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Roman garrison town of Corbridge.But what is the connection with the miracle at Markle The connection begins with Wilfridrsquos successor Acca, who became the abbot of St Andrewrsquos in Hexham in AD . He had travelled with Wilfrid and shared his devotion to St Andrew. It is said Acca acquired his own relics of St Andrew and added them to the collection at Hexham.But Acca the abbot was an evangelising monk. In AD , he left Hexham and journeyed beyond the old crumbling Roman wall and further north.It was around this time that East Lothian became part of Northumbria. But the kingdom beyond the seawas the land of the Picts.The story tells us that Acca met with the Pictish king Angusat a place called Kilrymont in Fe. Here, we are told, Acca gave the Christian Pictish leader some relics of St Andrew he had taken from Hexham and urged the king to create a new centre of Christian pilgrimage for the saint.From the limited historical accounts available, it does seem that it was indeed around this time that the religious site of St Andrews in Fe was established, at the place previously called Kilrymont.Further evidence of this is the amazing St Andrews Sarcophagus, which was discovered at St Andrews in the early th century. It can now be seen in the cathedral museum, where it is described as ldquoone of the finest examples of early medieval sculpture in Europe. It dates from the mid-s and was almost certainly commissioned by Angus for his own burial. He died in AD .And so the veneration of St Andrew in Scotland had begun well before the miracle at Markle, with King Angus resting at St Andrews in his magnicent sarcophagus. No wonder, then, when a later King Anguswas in need of ine intervention in AD , the saint he prayed to was St Andrew, who is then said to have replied in such a legendary, dramatic fashion.Here is the connection between the crypt at Hexham and the miracle seen at Markle: the relics of St Andrew brought to Fe which began the Scottish attachment to the saint may well have been part of the Hexham collection.But wait a minute! Thatrsquos not the story I have always been told when I go to St Andrews. The oft-told legend is that it was St Rulewho brought the relics to Fe in the fourth century. He was the bishop of the Greek city of Patras, where St Andrew was crucied.The story tells us he had a dream in which he was told that the relics of the saint, which he was the custodian of, were in danger and he must set sail with them. The dream told him that wherever he was shipwrecked, there the relics would find their new home.After months at sea, his ship was wrecked at Kilrymont in Fe. And so he established a new shrine and re-named the place St Andrews. No mention of a Northumbrian abbot, or relics from Hexham in this story!What are we to believe  There is often a haze between history and legend and they sometimes meet in a place too misty for us to see. Historical truth can be an elusive creature. You think you have grasped it when suddenly it slips away, leaving you searching once again. And sometimes a lost historical truth is to be found hidden in a legend.In the tale of St Andrewrsquos relics, history will side with the abbot, I suspect, but the romanticised and dramatic tale of St Rule has become the more popular and well-known explanation.But the reason for this is another story in itself.With thanks to Anna Blair, whose tale lsquoSaint and Saltirersquo inspired my research into this story."},{"url":null,"title":"council-planners-accused-of-having-a-lack-of-knowledge-of-their-own-policy","story":"A planning application to build the three-bedroom home and a detached garage on the outskirts of Camptoun Holdings, a small hamlet two miles north of Haddington, was refused by the local authority for the second time in five years.However, the applicants have now lodged an appeal in which they claim the planning officer who turned them down did not understand the policyused to make that decision.They claim that the house, which would be built on land currently occupied by derelict agricultural buildings, should be classed as an ldquoenabling development because they say it would improve the area.In an appeal which will be heard by the councilrsquos Local Review Body next month, they state: ldquoThe planner, in the pre-application response, did not accept that the proposed development was an enabling development.ldquoHowever, it is submitted that this conclusion only serves to demonstrate the lack of knowledge of the development process.ldquoTo allow for the removal of derelict buildings and reclamation of an unkempt siterequires third-party intervention.ldquoThe applicant is submitting a proposal for a single dwelling house and garage absorbing the costs of demolition and reclamation.ldquoThe development will bring substantial improvements to this rural brownfield land and improve landscape quality as well as visual and residential amenity.East Lothian Council has a planning policy which bars new housing in the countryside unless exceptional circumstances can be established.The plans for a house at Camptoun Holdings were first lodged with the council in .On that occasion they were refused and the Local Review Body rejected an appeal.Agents for the applicants this time around will argue that there has been a change in circumstances at the site, which has deteriorated further over the years.The Local Review Body meets in Haddington on Thursday, May ."},{"url":null,"title":"new-exhibition-highlights-history-of-musselburgh-athletic-fc","story":"The display was officially opened by Billy Brown, a former Hearts and Bradford City manager, who comes from Musselburgh and is a former Musselburgh Athletic manager, at a reception in the Old Town Hall.On show at the High Street museum is a iety of memorabilia relating to lsquoThe Burghrsquo, including trophies, medals, strips, pennants and photographs.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction.

So, although she didnrsquot elaborate on the outcome of the altercation, I can only imagine Ms Murray volleyed back as good as she got and ended up persuading the shop to accept Euros, groats and Monopoly money as well as Scottish cash.The tweet got so much traction because most Scots know and understand exactly how this interaction goes, just how grim and maddening it is no matter how many times yoursquove experienced it. These days many of us feel much more confident in our skins as Scots and are able to consider and reconcile our relationship with our English neighbours in more mature and expansive ways than ever before. But you still canrsquot escape the deep, primeval humiliation of having your money refused.

Not even in Scotland, as it turns out, where only coins have legal weight. According to the Bank of England, both coins and Bank of England notes are legal tender south of the border, with anything  a ldquomatter of agreement between the parties involved.

Whether that makes the shock greater is irrelevant: the loss and sorrow are the same. The rapid response of Parisians spoke of the deep place Notre Dame holds in Francersquos psyche. ldquoIt was Parisrsquos lighthouse, said one, indicating that this marvel of medieval gothic architecture was the brightest of all beacons in the famous city of lights. ldquoIt is our history, our literature, our imagination, said President Emmanuel Macron, vowing ldquowe will rebuild Notre Dame together.All of us who have visited Paris have made a bee-line for this remarkable, forbidding place, which perhaps explains why its destruction has touched people across the world. Notre Dame, home of Victor Hugorsquos tender-hearted hunchback, Quasimodo, is to Paris what Edinburgh Castle is to the capital: a massive, seemingly immovable monument, witness to centuries of turbulent affairs. Both have represented an unchanging presence around which tides of revolutions and revolts, war and politics have washed.As it lies in partial ruin, Notre Dame is being talked of as part of Francersquos soul. Yet this -year-old building carries meaning far beyond the countryrsquos border. It was here that Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned, and Joan of Arc beatied, but it was also the scene of Henry VI of Englandrsquos coronation as King of France, when he was a child. More than a century later, on April  , , Mary Stuart was married beneath its graceful soaring roof to Francis, the dauphin, son of Henri II. By all accounts it was an eye-wateringly extravagant event. A large theatrical stage was built outside the cathedral, and inside there was a massive triumphal arch. As weddings went, it was the most spectacular Notre Dame had ever witnessed.Read more: Macron vows to rebuild cathedralI doubt therersquos a country in Europe whose history has not crossed with the cathedralrsquos at some point. In certain respects, it is the most venerable symbol of an emerging Europe, a fulcrum for events that have made the continent what it is today. No wonder crowds watching the inferno from the Icircle de la Citeacute or on television wept.The largest of its  bells, Emmanuel, shares its name with the president. This coincidence might just prove fateful. Mr Macron rushed to the scene before the fire wholly engulfed the roof and spire. It is a little ironic that, as the flames took hold, he cancelled a recorded speech due to be broadcast at eight that evening. This statement was intended to restart his first term in office, and go some way towards appeasing the gilets jaunes movement, which has badly damaged his credibility and his countryrsquos stability.Doubtless he postponed because of the gravity of the unfolding disaster. Even so, Mr Macronrsquos emotional proclamation late into the night, in which he pledged to see the cathedral restored to glory, might prove to have been a masterly stroke.It is too cynical to suggest that even as the fire blazed the president understood that this crisis could improve his standing. But the political fall-out might nevertheless work to his advantage. In a way that no prepared script could, the presidentrsquos response to the fire, and his assurance that ldquotogether the cathedral will be rebuilt, will have won him new friends and admirers. He might have misjudged the national mood when handling the gilets jaunesrsquo demands, but on the night when Notre Dame burned, he too was ablaze. Instinctively he gauged the depth of feeling this place rouses in the people he governs. That affection, and the profound heritage the cathedral represents, crosses political, ideological and class ides. The wealthy of the Bouled Saint Germain feel the same in this matter as their compatriots in downtrodden rural France.If anything could unite people across the board, it is the sight of the countryrsquos best-loved building wreathed in blood-orange smoke. Some will doubtless see this calamity as a warning or sign, as when York Minster went on fire. Certainly, the potency of the pictures of such a blaze is primitive. You cannot fail to respond, nor to feel a passing shiver of superstition that, at this exceptionally troubled and uncertain time in Europe, it holds a message of some kind.For Mr Macron, that message might simply be that Notre Dame is a symbol of what unites the nation, an olive branch of sorts. In promising without hesitation to secure its future, he was committing also to hold together the France of liberteacute, eacutegaliteacute and fraterniteacute.It might not be the speech he expected to deliver, but it mayprove to be the finest he has yet made."},{"url":null,"title":"off-the-plot-beechgroves-hardy-perennial-jim-mccoll-retires-at-83","story":"But, aged , the Beechgrove Garden host has finally admitted it is time for him to lose the plot.BBC Scotland has announced his oh-so-very reluctant retirement from the show he has presented since .

Likewise, Nicola Sturgeon herself said that she would only call for another referendum when there was sustained support of more than  per cent for independence Another way of ensuring a decisive result for a referendum is to require a double majority ndash that all or a majority of parts of the country need to agree to the proposition. I have agreed with Ms Sturgeon in these pages that the Brexit referendum should have needed such a double majority. I am sure she will agree with me that it is just as reasonable to require that all or a majority of the regions and islands groups of Scotland should be required to vote for a Yes majority.The danger of proceeding on any other basis would be that No-voting areas such as the Borders and Orkney and Shetland might wish to follow Ms Sturgeons own example and say \"we didnt vote for it, so were not having it.\" They might then ndash again following the First Minsters example ndash seek respectively to rejoin the UK and become Crown dependencies, like the Bailiewicks of Guernsey and Jersey.Peter A Russell, Munro Road, Jordanhill, Glasgow.SOME people are shouting that there should be a mandated  per cent vote for the Yes side in the next Scottish independence referendum.Surely the  per cent rule should also apply to the No side.

Radiocarbon dating of the dog bones unearthed at Cuween has shown that the dogs were placed in the chamber more than  years after the passage tomb was built, suggesting that they were ritually buried.Steve Farrar, interpretation manager at HES, said: “Just as they’re treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep.“But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special signicance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about , years ago.#Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the ‘dog people’.“While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time.“Looking at this dog helps us better relate to the people who cared for and venerated these animals, people whose ingenuity and sophistication made Orkney such an important place in the Neolithic and who have left us with such a rich legacy of monuments today.”The canine reconstruction is part of a wider project to use cutting-edge technology to share the stories of Orkney’s Neolithic chambered tombs with visitors.Last year, HES published D digital models of these chambered cairns, created through photogrammetry to better reveal the sophisticated structure of these monuments with the public.This process involves taking hundreds of overlapping images which are then combined to create a D model, enabling users from anywhere in the world to explore the sites in detail online.All of this new research will form part of updated interpretation  for visitors to Orkney’s chambered cairns, including Cuween Hill, due to be installed this summer. The reconstruction itself will also be going on display in Orkney later this year.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Their guests are interested in all types of accommodation, from hotels and guesthouses, to BBs and self-catering, and most will arrive with their own or hired cars.#They have the flexibility to explore areas off the busy, well-beaten tracks and taking a local guide with them or booking a private or scheduled tour is a popular way to do this.#She added: #Once operators understand how much there is to see and do in Orkney and how many islands there are, in addition to the wonderful food, drink and crafts we have, they appreciate why we recommend three to four-night stays as a minimum for their guests.”Ms Tulloch said that Destination Orkney hoped to build on the opportunities the travel trade industry was now offering to Orkney by running future workshops for tourism members locally.“We’d like all our members to be aware of the potential this section of the industry presents and to equip them with the necessary tools and knowledge they will needthey would like to work effectively with the travel trade,” she explained.Joining Ms Tulloch on the Orkney stand at the Expo were travel trade consultant, Kathleen Hogarth, Destination Orkney members Hazel Aim and Fidra Sym of Orkney Heritage Tours, and Destination Orkney chairman and hotelier Gareth Crichton.Expo was also attended by Pentland Ferries, NorthLink Ferries, John O’ Groats Ferries and representatives from Shetland, forming a strong presence for the Northern Isles.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the event of any archaeological discoveries of interest, SSEN Transmission has said it is committed to ensuring these are fully documented, preservedpossible, with the findings shared with interested parties.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

No leave option.#Put it to the people#.!Thought they did ..!Very proud of the Shetlands for making a stand. If only every town in the UK stood as tall. Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #. The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe . As well as being English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish we are all European . We # leavers # like Europe a lot, we strongly dislike being part of the dictatorial , undemocratic , unaccountable European Union . OK  The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed. It will take us, at least, ten years to rejoin, accepting the euro, the Common FIsheries Policy and austerity invoking budget restrictions to manage our large budget deficit.So why is the SNP stamping about, #greetin der een oot#, about Scots #being dragged out of the UK against their wishes#, when their defining policy, independence, will take us out, unlikely, ever to rejoin Humbug!# EA_Scotland_and_the_EU#Whether or not one is in favour of Brexit, how many people truly knew what they were voting for in   Misinformation and disinformationflew about like panic stricken puffins and some politicians loved it.So much of what was involved came to light over the time which has elapsed and STILL confusion reigns. Thank goodness the leadership during the Second World War was not as pathetic as the present incumbents are.Meanwhile, those nations over the other side of the English Channel must be wondering why the Brits are allowing themselves to be so humiliated ..What about the  that stayed away# So very true today.Spot on Ian !! Voters don’t always get the chance to change the government, but they may want the chance to change their mind.You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn. If he repeatedly takes the same self-defeating approach and expects a dferent result# well conclusions may also be drawn. Can’t these lads raise their game Again you only want democracypeople vote the way you tell them. That#s not democracypeter has got it wrong again there was no cheating in the leave side#What started out as a witch-hunt by the political establishment in what they thought was the largest political scandal investigating Cambridge Analytica and Goddard Gunster’s alleged involvement in the Leave.EU referendum campaign, has today been proven to be . Instead, the Electoral Commission fined us on technicalities and an overspend of £,, not the £, originally presented by them on £ million overall spend. The fines were reduced and the Judge accepted the technical breaches were ‘mistakes’ rather than calculated wrong-doings and crucially held there were ‘no findings that Leave.EU had been dishonest.#”#.Does Ian mean the .m who were lied to by self-serving cheats  Ian might be interested in this from the Chair of The British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee:The referendum result was NOT #the will of the people# # certainly not following the revelations since.Thank you for asking the people to vote again.Can we also put it to the people in Shetlandthey still want to live inside a windfarm  How many times do we get to vote Past comments on referendums from David Davis MP could soothe or enrage frustrated Leavers. Speaking to parliament in  he said: We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for.#theyworkforyou says former Brexit Minsiter Davis received £, for  hours work for JCB this year, and that he generally voted against a statutory register of lobbyists. Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere. Let’s look for the way forward.Careful Andrew. Well argued points are rarely welcomed here. Try being more extreme and ill informed, clueless but convinced YOUR opinion is the only correct opinion. Then tear the opposing opinion up for toilet paper.Mr Holt, this is the best on-the-button analysis that I have ever read on the Brexit process. The Brexit debate has laid bare a much deeperpolitical crises, that is ,the existential crises of future democracy in the UK itself and I do fear for that future .I am intrigued as to the motive behind Brexit, and what advantage this would be to the Conservatives and their agenda   What political advantage would there have been in leaving the EU as opposed to remaining for the Conservative Party, and is this the real reason why there was an EU Ref.in the first place Was the EU Ref. politically or economically advantageous to the Conservative Party regardless to what the people of the UK voted for      The people voted, but did they vote knowing what the aftermath would be in its entirety    The advantage to the Tories, in the short term at least, was to shut up those on the right who were agitating, causing a ided party defecting to further right associations attracting further right sympahisers support. It backfired on them though, they didn#t expect #Leave# to win, they were relying on #Remain# winning to silence the dissent. #Leave# winning caused the whole establishment to descend in to a silent panic they#re still in shock and denial from, hence the total pigs ear of the last few monthsI voted believing #Leave# in the belief it meant exactly that, close the door, walk away, build a wall up the middle of the North Sea Channel, call it what you like. Back to pre # status for everything, no exceptions, no bits and pieces held on to and dragged with us that have been conceived while part of the EEC EU.I did not know we were going to end up stuck in an eternal country destroying limbo that Westminster has dragged us in to and seem hell bent on keeping us in.Only politicians could try and convince the public they#re acting in the national interest while doing everything to destroy the country.I totally agree with your comments, Michael. It certainly has put the Conservatives into a situation where it has caused ision and political mayhem within the government as well as affecting, to a degree, other political parties. It has also weakened the basis for leaving the EU, and the aftermath, politically and economically, and the mess which has occurred thereafter. On the outset, from what I know, it did not make economic sense to leave the EU, based on the feedback, prior to the EU Ref from many British companies trading within the EU, and the possible damage it would cause  I believe % of British trade was directly with the EU, and now this figure could be vastly reduced as a consequence We are, the UK, in uncharted waters, so to speak, and it could, possibly, take years to smooth out or cause greater calamity with the EU. I hope the future relationship with the EU, does not have a negative impact on trading relationships######time shall tell, as they say. It has put the future of the EU in doubt, as other countries within the EU, also wanting to have referendums  A big problem was using a referendum to answer a complex question. Should we ban smoking in public places#  Yes No. Easy. Should we leave the EU  It’s not as simple as some pretended. Did it mean leaving in every respect  It wasn’t entirely a Yes No question. Were all the knock-on consequences clear from the start No. Some politicians are reluctant to harm the economy. Most believe Parliament is sovereign. Switzerland takes many decisions by referendum. Britain doesn’t. The public were sold a lie from the outset # that politicians would put the result above the national interest. They were sold others later, including by “trustworthy” Farage. For some, not cutting our nose off to spite our face is a matter of principle. For others, we can only get Britain back to its former splendour by going it alone # which might not turn out to be that viable. But there is financial itself interest at work for the pro-Brexit mega-rich who want a low-tax Britain, and they don’t mind turning up the volume on intolerant rhetoric to strengthen their position. Brexit or not, they’ve now strengthened their position # worrying given their aims and the repulsive means they willingly embrace.You mean the mega rich that made their fortune by evading tax and suing the NHS because they didn#t get a contract  folk like Richard Branson the prominent remoaner. Or geldof who lives in the UK tax free under non dom status Or Osbourne, Cameron, Salmond, Blaire!! I wish I was poor like them!It was a simple question. Only those who do not like the result try and pretend otherwise.#Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union #If #leave the European Union# somehow, as you try to convince us, can be interpreted as only leaving certain bits of the EU, then the same must also apply to the alternative choice of#remain a member of the European Union# and it be interpreted as only remaining within certain bits of the EU. Which would have made asking the question in the first place meaningless and pointless, as regardless which way anyone chose to vote it meant the same thing.#Leave the European Union# and #remain a member of the European Union# can only be interpreted one way, as per the dictionary definition, as the question contains no caveats. Besides, being the good old Socialists that they are in their mission to list, label and micro manage everything, you#re either a full member of the EU or you#re not. There is no mechanism or precedent to sorta half leave, but not leave everything, like you suggest. Fully in, or fully out, them be the choices.Anotherthe pro-Brexit mega-rich Torie Peter, # The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP tweeted that he would supporting the Brexit Party #for one-time only# as he wants to secure the UK#s departure from the EU.# Head out of tail end time perhaps!!!I think Michael will have to agree it doesn’t appear to be a question Parliament wanted this answer to! Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more. It’s a really big tangle because ultimately for the U.K. it is Parliament that is sovereign. For Scotland apparently it is the people that’s sovereign, so there may be a clash ahead. I’m not sure how many people voted to break up the U.K. Maybe the only solution now will be to have a confirmatory vote.#Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more#.Really  What are the choices then  Like I said above, those are the only two available where the EU is concerned. Which is a goodish chunk of the reason some of us voted out, you either accept everything that Brussels dictates, or reject everything Brussels dictates, participating in the things that work in your country and rejecting those which don#t isn#t an option. The EEC EU worked up to a point while some level of give and take was possible with such things, now that its not, the EU are on a fast track to implosion civil war, whichever arrives first.“What are the choices ” No idea, but, from the news, No-Deal is now No-Go.Sorryfolk were misled, but why is no-deal seemingly now no-go  Its because we vote for MPs, and they do what they think they should, not what we want. It’s a sair fecht, but most MPs seemingly want to spare the country needless economic damage the people didn’t knowingly vote for. That’s then doing their jobs btw.Lets wait and see nowa compromise emerges that Parliament can live with, orthey can agree a question they need to put to the people.MPs are our representatives, put there to do what they think is best. They are not our servents put there to mindlessly do our bidding. This key fact allows them the wriggle room they need to change their minds once the facts change. This reality behind our representative democracy illuminates the lie that was Cameron’s “advisory referendum” which, funnily enough, he promised to obey. You’ve got to love those Tories# or not. No-deal was a fake promise, which, happily for some, still distracts attention from the many harms of needless austerity. Let’s face it, Brexit never really meant Leave.Maybe the times really are changing. The Tories are in the process of self-destruction, Corbyn#s labour has never been more extream, proven racist anti-semitic with a gutless leader failing on so many levels. The Liberals more or less wiped out, the Greens one MP has a Ph, D in Elizabethan sexual practices and the SNP leader under investigation for breaking the Ministerial code and former leader and strong man on , charges of alleged attempted rape and multiple sexual assaults! All at the same time as the eco Lunatics are super glueing themselves to trains. Hard to make that lot all up. The one good point is that UKIP having jumped into bed with Tommy Robinson and his anti-Islamic White supremacists are being wiped out by Farage and the Brexit party. Well, every cloud has a silver lining. Strange times indeed!!!Strange times indeed # the founder of The Brexit Part had to resign last month for racist and anti-Islamic statements. And these are the new #moderates# Aberdeen university has just shown the same islamiphobia by taking the sultan of Brunei#s degree from him for being a good muslim and implementing islamic law in his country.For the benefit of some, especially Peter Hamilton and David Spence, one of your very own, wealthy Torie and meg rich man, ” The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP, George Galloway.Tory  The word is derived from the gaelic or Irish,meaning an outlaw,brigand,or thief, very descriptive of the modern day Conservative party is it not.Another example of the language being used in everyday speech but George Gallowaymmm a de ken,the jury is oot on that ane!Tory  That name derives from !

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733279.jpg--.jpg?1555495975000\n","title":"ballymena young conquerors spring concert","story":"BALLYMENA Young Conquerors Flute Band will be holding its annual concert on Thursday, May  in the Braid Arts Centre Ballymena, commencing at . pm.The band is the town’s oldest surviving music group, having been formed in .

Fans of the Brooke-based Paddy ‘Raff’ have lapped up his BT alter ego ‘Nigel’ in online sketches such as ‘Nigel at the Christmas Market’, ‘Nigel the BT Tout’, as well as the storming stage performances of ‘Paddy and Nigel Act Their Postcodes’.Set for yet another sell-out run of four shows at the city centre’s Limelight venue, Paddy told the Andersonstown News that he is “gobsmacked” at the response to his on stage routines and that of ‘Bravo Tango er’ Nigel. “It’s class,” said Paddy, “I remember when the hosepipe ban was in full effect last year, thinking what kind’ve voice would go with someone who would tout on his neigbours and their over-use of their hose pipe. “The character of Nigel started with a Snapchat filter. This to me looked like some kind’ve posh dude, the mullet, the aviator glasses and moustache. Luckily it was one you could replicate easily as a lot of the filters are quite contorted. “The first one went viral and featured on BBC Trending NI. At the time I didn’t think it would be a recurring character but people really responded to it, they were like ‘you gotta do more with that posh guy’, I just kept going back to it, it’s a pure fluke how it came about,” he said. Since Paddy took to the stage at the Palm House in Belfast and Derry’s Nerve Centre, he has performed to thousands of comedy fans during a series of three sold-out shows at the MAC theatre in March.  “I remember when the MAC tickets went on sale, I checked the tickets and the map was completely grey, I thought ‘maybe I’ve got that the wrong away about ’, but a second show was penciled in and within two hours of that going onsale we put on a third one. “The Limelight is  people capacity and three of the shows are already gone, the fourth one is approaching sell-out. I’m blown away. Basically I’m responding to the demand that’s out there.”Paddy spoke of how he is working with producers to develop ideas for TV both here and across the water. “I’ve a massive, massive list of ideas for more sketches. I’m sort of a one man band, still a full-time dad and it’s like anything it’s getting the time. I’m making the time for it now, it’s not a nine-to-five job in that you are at the desk. My we and I have fantastic support from our families so that is great to have. “I’ve achieved more than I ever thought I would, it’s not even been a year since the first solo show. I’ve put a lot of effort into this show and want to let as many people come to see it before moving on. At the minute I’m looking at a bigger venue for a new show, possibly towards the end of the year.I’ve loads of ideas and it’s been great to have received the support and reception the show has so far to date had.”Paddy and Nigel at the Limelight takes place on Sunday May .

The President will deliver a speech to mark the historic occasion as the £. million three-storey building in the Gaeltacht Quarter prepares to open its doors to visitors for the first time. Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, Harry Connolly, told the Andersonstown News that it was an “honour” to have the President open the centre.“James Connolly lived on the Falls Road just yards away from the location of the new Visitor Centre,” he said. “He was a man of formidable ideas and remarkable vision. Over  years after James Connolly was executed, his values, his ideas and the example he gave us in le are as inspiring and relevant as ever.”Harry Connolly said: “It is entirely fitting and appropriate that the President of Ireland will officially open the James Connolly Visitor Centre and pay tribute to Connolly’s colossal contribution to our nation and to the lives of so many across the world.” As well as the President’s visit,  trade union leaders from  dferent unions have also arrived in the city to attend the opening including General President of the Labourers’ International Union of North AmericaTerry O’Sullivan and Rocco Davis, Vice President and Regional Manager of Pacic Southwest Region of . James Connolly travelled to the US and is strongly linked with the trade union movement in the States.Harry continued: “The realisation of Áras Uí Chonghaile is another major step forward for the success story that is West Belfast tourism. Supported by the Connolly family and funded by Belfast City Council and the US Trade Union Movement, this new visitor centre will have a major social and economic impact on Belfast’s Gaeltacht Quarter, attracting thousands of visitors from across the globe every year. “We are inviting everyone to take part in the James Connolly Parade, leaving Conway Mill at pm on Good Friday and parading along the Falls Road to arrive at Áras Uí Chonghaile at .pm. “Outside the front of the centre a number of guest speakers headed by President Higgins will speak, and Irish singing star Frances Black will perform live along with renowned Belfast balladeer Terry ‘Cruncher’ O’Neill. “We are saying to everyone, from the Falls Road, from Belfast, from across Ireland and from further afield, come along and take part in the parade and attend the opening ceremony outside Áras Uí Chonghaile. Good Friday will be James Connolly Day on the Falls Road and we aim to do him proud.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"taking the crooked glen to crumlin","story":"THROUGH a process of Anglicisation, Crumlin is among the thousands of Irish towns and areas whose place names are virtually lost in translation. Situated in Antrim’s hills, the Crumlin derives its name from the Irish ‘An Cromghlinn’, meaning The Crooked Glen, which is the name adopted by one the town’s most exciting new pubs.Headed up by North Belfast businessman Laurence Burns and his brother Damien, The Crooked Glen is bringing the original meaning of the name Crumlin back into everyday use in the town and breathing new le into one of the Main Street’s most prominent buildings.Laurence has spent the last -years leading operations at the popular city centre nightclub, Thompson’s Garage, and has also worked on a number of the city’s biggest events and festivals, including our own Best of the North awards ceremony. However, when the opportunity to run his own bar and restaurant arose he jumped at the opportunity, and while aiming to bring something new to the area he said paying homage to the town’s Irish-speaking heritage was vital.“I was always trying to keep my ear to the ground so that when a pub came up I would be in contention for it,” he said.“I had done that through Jeeves Limited and then the opportunity came up just before Christmas.“There was an opportunity for me to take it on – along with my brother who is my business partner – and give it a wee bit more care and attention.“It had been O’Connor’s twice before under two dferent businesses. The previous owner was O’Connor and the guy who took it on firstly was O’Connor, so I didn’t want to be the third O’Connor’s and that’s where the Crooked Glen came into it. There’s a big Irish speaking community up in Crumlin and I just thought they would appreciate that the name came from Irish origins. That’s where the name came from and it has gotten a really good response.“I got a logo and then used the boys from North Belfast Graphic to implement the artwork outside on the walls, the menus, and all the rest of it.”He continued: “I fell in love with it the first time I came into it. I just loved the character of it.“The first time I came in was as a customer, I sat downstairs and had a bit of craic with a few of the locals who are now my regulars. They were giving me a bit of stick and saying thatyou’re eating in here you have to keep the fire filled up. We were just having a bit of banter – I actually did get up and put a bit of coal on the fire. I hadn’t even seen upstairs at that stage, but I had my lunch and said to Damien that I had a really good feeling about the place. I knew I liked it right away, I had a feeling for it and I could see the potential.”In terms of its space, The Crooked Glen has it all – a cosy fireside bar, a beautul upstairs restaurant and a fantastic outdoor area. In the short six weeks since taking over the venue, the Burns brothers have implemented an exciting new menu, improved service standards and have lined up a number of talented artists for their weekly live music sessions.“The responses and reviews that I’m getting is that we’ve taken a bit of creativity from Belfast and brought it up into Crumlin – that’s no disrespect to anything that was already up here,” Laurence said.“It’s the first time that things have been done in this way up here. In the restaurant it will be a bit more of a service led experience, downstairs is your good hearty pub grub with the music, the fire and the pints, upstairs you have a bit more of a refined dining experience.”By offering everything from food to live music and sports, The Crooked Glen aims to have “something for everybody” in the town.“I don’t think Crumlin has had that calibre of musician here on a regular basis. We want to bring the best of what we can afford here, we can’t charge on the door, but we’ll put on the best music possible with a ied selection on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.”He added: “Crumlin sometimes feels like you’re in Donegal because it has that country village feeling, but you’re also on the doorstep of Belfast, so people are used to going in and out of the city and sampling what it has to offer.“We’re trying to take the good things that are in Belfast and the good things of village le in Crumlin and combine them into what should be a strong brand in the Crooked Glen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Noel-.png","title":"the day when the bovedy trailed above our heads","story":"Former De La Salle pupil Noel Connor explains the background to his exhibition The Bovedy Illuminations which can be seen at The Armagh Planetarium until May THE sky always seemed low over our street in Andersonstown, with the Black Mountain looming behind the housing estate, seeming to draw down the sky. And on top of the dark silhouette, the television mast, it’s flashing light a constant presence above my childhood. My friends and I played football in the street constantly. I remember watching my first few live football matches on television and being shocked that they stopped after ninety minutes. Why would you stop But playing in the street on Friday evenings was dficult as it was always especially busy then. At the end of the week the wages were in and everyone arrived in cars and vans and trucks to collect their money. Seamus the bread man in his Barney Hughes van, Tommy the milkman with his terric leather satchel full of loose change slung over his shoulder, and not one insurance man but two, wearing suits and all sweetness and light. Our grocery order would arrive all the way from McAlea’s shop on Divis Street, the Mikado biscuits always lying tantalizingly on top. As many people were going out as coming in, with older brothers and sisters all dressed up, heading downtown for the start of the weekend.So that evening my mates and I took our football down to ‘the Ring’, Koram Ring, a sort of muddy roundabout where our street ended and converged with three other streets. It was a perfect circle of baldy grass, criss-crossed by paths which people used as a shortcuts from street to street.At times, every kid on the street would be there, the McMahon’s, McCann’s, Gilmore’s, Murphy’s, Bannan’s, Allen’s, Casey’s, and me, always me.Not long after we had started playing, the ‘Bovedy’ blazed low across the sky above our heads at that stage a magnicent fireball floodlighting a group of amazed kids. We all stood transfixed, watching it disappear off behind the mountain, having no idea what had just occurred. Back at home, I discovered that no one  had witnessed the event, and over the subsequent days and weeks it was forgotten about. Indeed, recalling the event in much later years, I could find no family member, friend or neighbour who could remember anything of the evening, it was almost asthe subsequent years of violence and political unrest had brutally erased the memory. I almost began to believe that I had created some sort of  memory.But as an visual artist it was too profound an image to be ignored and many years later my research eventually led me to the Armagh Planetarium. Not only did they confirm the event and times and dates, but the actual meteorite which had come to ground on farmland at Bovedy, had been loaned to their collection. I was invited to visit and had the extraordinary privilege of holding the mysterious object which had fireballed across my childhood sky in . Anyone from my generation will recognize the signicance of that year in Northern Ireland, and I have come to regard that event as symbolizing an end to the innocence of my childhood. At that point I had begun to take an interest in art, and had travelled into Belfast with my pocket money, especially to buy my first proper set of paints, from the Educational Supply Store in Fountain Lane. I can imagine that my precious paint box was sitting open on my bedroom windowsill where I kept it and would have been lit up by the passing meteorite. In many ways that image lit the fuse on the work I have produced for this whole project.Having the opportunity to work with the original copy of my old school register, which was completed on that day, has also provided a terric stimulus for the work. Those ink crosses, made by our teacher, registered my ‘presence’ and that of all my friends as the Bovedy crossed the Universe towards us. I captured each tiny mark using microphotography, and then projected them across the surface of the meteorite, photographing the results. These previously insignicant and long forgotten trails of ink were transported and transcribed across fty years of space and time, to create wonderful visual and poetic illuminations.The project provided such a iety of stimulus, that I needed an outcome which could combine image, poetry and sound, and I began experimenting with film and audio recordings. I will be forever grateful to my friend Davy McBride, who was able to work with a class of boys at our old school, now La Salle College, recording them responding to the original class register of th April . That recording became the spine of ‘The Bovedy Illuminations’, the short film I’ve produced for the exhibition.I also wanted a poetic narrative to run throughout the film, at times in two voices, allowing me a dialogue with my fourteen-year-old self. To my amazement I discovered that Nathan Quinn O’Rawe, a current pupil at the school had previously won the prestigious ‘Poetry Aloud’ Award, a national competition to find the best young reader of poetry in Ireland. Throughout the film, Nathan speaks as my younger self. Again I am indebted to Davy for recording us both at the school.Without a doubt, this project would not have come to fruition without the support of Professor David Burton and his colleagues at the Planetarium, and I can’t thank them enough. Having the opportunity to present a complementary exhibition of my photoworks and poetry at the Market Place Theatre and Arts Centre enabled me to further develop my response to the project, and I’mgrateful to Christine Donnelly for her help and support there.www.noelconnor"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38005449.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/foster418.jpg","title":"foster if eu wont negotiate on backstop uk faces nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

a request that was denied.The tribunal heard that Ms Wilson had a panic attack on the telephone with a human resources worker when advised of Ms Hardings proposed attendance at the meeting.Ms Wilson then lodged a grievance by letter in which she formalised her complaint of bullying and detailed her concerns, including the handling of the -to-work meeting.Following an investigation into Ms Wilsons list of  complaints, an outcome letter in November  stated that \"no evidence of bullying and harassment\" from Ms Harding could be found.Ms Wilson appealed this outcome, but the charity did not uphold her appeal or find her complaints substantiated.She resigned following receipt of the grievance outcome the following February.The tribunal was told of an incident on June , , nine days before Ms Wilson went on sick leave, when she had been shouted at and humiliated in front of her colleagues by Ms Harding.Earlier that same year, in an appraisal, Ms Harding was critical of Ms Wilsons time management skills and compared her unfavourably with other staff.Barrister Sean Doherty, acting on behalf of Praxis Care, suggested it was \"a matter of interpretation as to whether this amounted to bullying\".He noted that Ms Harding had accepted she was direct and he conceded that she was undoubtedly confrontational due to her frustration that \"paperwork had not been completed\".He characterised the incident as having happened \"in the heat of the moment\".Mr Doherty further suggested that Ms Wilsons complaint about the grievance process was driven by her disappointment at not being vindicated.In his submission, Mr Doherty said the -to-work meeting was an opportunity to address matters and suggested the purpose of Ms Hardings attendance was \"not to berate and criticise\" Ms Wilson.The tribunal found the conduct of Praxis \"was likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence\" with Ms Wilson and that she had \"resigned in response to this conduct\".It also ruled that Ms Wilsons grievances were \"not investigated in a fair and appropriate manner.\"It did not accept Mr Dohertys contention that Ms Wilson did not resign quickly enough, stating that she chose to exercise her contractual right to seek redress of her complaints through the grievance procedure and appeal.\"She was reserving her position following the y period of incapacity,\" it stated.A further remedies hearing will be convenedboth parties are unable to agree on financial losses incurred by Ms Wilson."},{"url":null,"title":"every vote matters to stop sinn fein becoming biggest party says dup leader","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

His selection will be formally ratied at a meeting of the UUPs executive tomorrow.Yesterday the SDLP and Alliance Party also confirmed their candidates for the May  poll as Colum Eastwood and Naomi Long respectively.Mr Kennedys selection comes following the retirement of veteran Ulster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson.Mr Kennedy , a former Newry and Armagh MLA, previously revealed he had voted Remain in the  referendum but said the vote by the UK as a whole to leave the EU \"must be respected and implemented\".Mr Kennedy said that there was a lack of representation for unionists who voted Remain, with the DUP backing the Leave campaign.\"Like many people, I am angry that Brexit has been so badly handled and uncertainty has increased,\" he said.\"I will offer a constructive approach to Brexit. Lets do Brexit right and end the uncertainty.\"Im from a border community. I am a border unionist and I know exactly what all this means.\"There are those who claim to represent people who voted Remain, but they havent represented unionists who voted Remain in the last two years and they wont do so in the future.\"Unionists who voted to remain in the EU did not vote to leave the United Kingdom.\"Mr Eastwood, the SDLP leader, also confirmed yesterday that he would run for the European Parliament, saying it should be regarded as another referendum.The Foyle MLA described next months vote as an \"election like no other\".\"In June  a majority of people from communities across Northern Ireland came together to express our clear will that we should remain in the European Union,\" he said.\"It was a vote that, unlike many others, saw people break free from their traditional trenches to occupy a common ground and a common identity.\"Since then, the broad progressive coalition that came together has been sidelined and silenced. Without a government in Belfast and with the DUP aligned to hard Brexit fanatics in London, people here have been ignored. Enough is enough.\"This European election should be a referendum - the Norths peoples vote.\"Mr Eastwood said the SDLP would be \"a strong voice championing our shared values\" and opposing what he said was the \"destructive ideology\" leading the UK Government towards a hard border. Ms Long said she was running as an Alliance candidate to allow voters to express their will for a second referendum.Speaking as she submitted her nomination papers at the Electoral Office of Northern Irelands headquarters in Belfast yesterday, Ms Long, an East Belfast MLA, said the \"chaos and uncertainty created by Brexit\" had impacted every aspect of le.\"People felt badly let down in the  referendum and since, and Parliament has now reached an impasse,\" she added.\"The best and potentially only way through this crisis is to put Brexit back to the people.\"Alliance supports a peoples vote, crucially including the option to remain.\"A vote for Alliance in this election is the best way to send a clear message we want that new referendum.\"At the last European elections in  the three Northern Ireland seats went to Sinn Feins Martina Anderson, the DUPs Diane Dodds and Mr Nicholson of the UUP. The SDLP missed out on winning the third seat by fewer than , votes.The main candidates running for the three seats this time are Ms Anderson, Mrs Dodds, Mr Kennedy, Mr Eastwood and Ms Long. Clare Bailey will run for the Green Party while Robert Hill will run for Ukip.

In spring , he began flirting with her and using sexual innuendos.Crown prosecutor Neil Connor told Antrim Crown Court, sitting in Belfast, that this flirtation progressed to text messages. McBride initially sent her images of women both in lingerie and naked, with comments such as: \"I like women who dress up.\"Mr Connor said the teenager was \"somewhat flattered\" by the attention and reciprocated with text messages to McBride. These messages - some of which were sent while she was  - included images of her naked.McBride sent the teenager around  naked images of him and they exchanged what the Crown said were \"graphic\" texts.In these messages, McBride told the girl he wanted to have sex with her, and set out what he wanted her to do to him, and what he wanted her to wear. They then met up in July  \"for the purpose of sex\".After she turned , she and McBride began a consensual sexual relationship, and they continued sending naked images to each other.Mr Connor revealed the relationship continued for around five months - until McBride began a sexual relationship with one of her friends.The complainant, now , went to police in June  and McBride was subsequently arrested.He told police he had been in a sexual relationship with the teenager, but said he believed she was .He also branded their relationship \"a bit of extra-marital fun\".Telling the judge there were \"aggravating factors\", Mr Connor spoke of the -year age gap between McBride and the teenager, and the grooming element which saw her sending him images of herself.Defence barrister, Charles MacCreanor QC, said his client was \"shamed and disgusted by what he has done\". Pointing out that McBride came before the court with a clear record, Mr MacCreanor spoke of the impact the offending has had on McBrides domestic situation and also on his business as \"people dont want to associate with him because of the nature of the allegations\".Judge Miller said that after reading a pre-sentence report, he felt McBride had displayed both \"an apparent lack of empathy\" for the complainant, and a \"self-centred attitude.\"The judge also cast doubt on McBrides claims he believed the girl was  when they began having sex, saying it was his belief McBride deliberately targeted someone \"half his age\" for his own \"deviant sexual interests\".As well as being jailed, McBride was also made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for five years."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic latest delays and diversions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Nadler has also summoned Mr Mueller to give evidence.The subpoena is the opening shot in what could be a y legal battle as Congress escalates its investigation of US President Donald Trump.If the Justice Department does not respond, Democrats could hold officials in contempt of Congress or eventually fight the battle in court.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Four pages of the Mueller Report The Judiciary Committee voted - earlier this month to give Mr Nadler permission to issue subpoenas for the final report, its exhibits and any underlying evidence or materials prepared for Mr Mueller’s investigation.Mr Nadler said: “It now falls to Congress to determine the full scope of that alleged misconduct and to decide what steps we must take going forward.” While Mr Mueller declined to prosecute Mr Trump on obstruction of justice, he did not exonerate the president, all but leaving the question to Congress.Mr Mueller’s report provides fresh evidence of Mr Trump’s interference in the Russia investigation and challenges Congress to respond. The risks for both parties are clearthey duck the responsibility or prolong an inquiry that, rather than coming to a close, may be just beginning.“My committee needs and is entitled to the full version of the report and the underlying evidence consistent with past practice,” Mr Nadler said.Mr Barr sent Congress a redacted version of the report, blacking out several types of material, including classied information, material pertaining to ongoing investigations and grand jury evidence.Mr Nadler said he is open to working with the department “to reach a reasonable accommodation for access to these materials, however I cannot accept any proposal which leaves most of Congress in the dark, as they grapple with their duties of legislation, oversight and constitutional accountability”.Statements are made about me by certain people in the Crazy Mueller Report, in itself written by  Angry Democrat Trump Haters, which are fabricated  totally untrue. Watch out for people that take so-called “notes,” when the notes never existed until needed. Because I never....— Donald J. TrumpApril , Republicans are eager to move beyond what Mr Trump calls the “witch hunt” that has overshadowed the party and the presidency. While Democrats say Mr Mueller’s findings are far more serious than initially indicated in Mr Barr’s four-page summary last month, they have been hesitant to pursue the ultimate step, impeachment proceedings, despite pressure from the left flank of the party to begin efforts to try to remove the president from office.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, travelling on a congressional trip to Ireland, said in a joint statement with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer that Mr Mueller’s report revealed more than was known about the obstruction question.“As we continue to review the report, one thing is clear: Attorney General Barr presented a conclusion that the president did not obstruct justice while Mueller’s report appears to undercut that finding,” they said.Later, in a letter to House Democrats, Ms Pelosi vowed: “Congress will not be silent.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pope to lead good friday procession at the colosseum in rome","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I knew Lyra McKee very well, I was one of her media lecturers as part of the Headliners project some years ago and we have been in regular contact since then. She recently moved to Derry where she was working as a freelance journalist.

delivered letters to education chief, Derek Baker, imploring him to reverse a decision on its proposed closure.The group gathered outside the Guildhall in the cold as the Permanent Secretary from the Department for Education met a cross-party delegation inside.The meeting follows a motion proposed by SDLP Councillor Shauna Cusack stating that it recognised “local schools are facing unprecedented financial pressures following real reductions in core funding for education, to the sum of £ per pupil over the last number of years.”There was disappointment amongst the parents and young people when it was decided that Mr Baker would not come outside to personally address their concerns.Instead, it was agreed that one parent, Leanne Brown, would enter the Mayor’s parlour on behalf of the group to present Mr Baker with letters written by children from the Coshquin-based school.She hopes Mr Baker will take time to digest the messages and pictures drawn by children which express their “love” for the school, and that they will inform his decision.Speaking outside the Guildhall on Tuesday, Ivan Peoples, who attended the school as a pupil and now has a child in primary , said he came along to voice his concerns to decision-makers.“I thought the whole future of Northern Ireland was to integrate both sides of the community and I don’t understand why they’d want to close the only one they have on the West Bank.“Foyle College has already moved to the Waterside, and the only other school we have in the city is Oakgrove, and for us to travel over there could cause problems.  If it’s a windy day the bridge can be closed.“The school is integrated in more than just religion, there are people with additional needs, and I think it teaches young people to be caring towards people with needs and can help prevent bullying further down the line.“It was a small school when I was there and I don’t see why they should close it now when there is going to be so much development around it.”Martina McCourt’s son Michael is the most recent pupil to enrol at Groarty P.S. after she decided the school was best-placed to meet his “complex needs”.“Because the school he was at was so big there weren’t enough staff to cater for his needs.“The staff there are fantastic and they picked up on things straight away, certain traits in class, and when I was expressing concerns they were in agreement.“I’m only finding out myself that there are pupils with dferent needs, some with severe needs, and each one of them is being catered for as an inidual and they all accept each other.“It’s just like a wee family and I love it.  He’s coming on great.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“My niece also went to Groarty and she has excelled since.“I would ask the Education Authority to please reconsider because every child deserves a chance.”‘Unique’Independent Councillor Sean Carr organised for the parents to attend after meeting them at the school last week.“We’re very disappointed that the parents didn’t get to meet the permanent secretary.  Some of the young people wanted to read their letters to him.“If you read some of the stories they’re a powerful testimony of the school and hopefully he will read them now.“There would have been no hassle, a few parents and children wanted to have their say, so it’s very disappointing.“The school has been there for quite some time and children who have left bigger schools have thrived at Groarty P.S., that is what we need, and it is unique in this part of the world.“I’d like to see the school retained and a new build for that school which at one stage they were promised with all the new development around Skeoge.”Meanwhile, Independent Councillor Darren O’Reilly, was at the meeting with Mr Baker and he said ious points were aired about the pressures faced by parents, principals and frontline workers.“There needs to be pressure politically and people need to take direct action like we’ve seen today.  More of that is needed to put pressure onKaren Bradley.“Our school system is in a serious mess, a crisis, and I don’t think the Tories are too worried about wains in Derry.  We need to make sure they know and the only way to do that is to campaign.“All the parties were unied in saying schools need more resources and Groarty P.S. needs to be protected.”Ultimately, any final decision regarding the future of Groarty Integrated P.S. has to be taken by a minister, ordevolved institutions are still suspended, by the permanent secretary at the Department of Education by January .The

Limerick had a few half chances, but couldnrsquot convert. lsquoHinch had chances of their own, including Alex Millarrsquos reverse shot which flew inches wide of the net.Millar was in the thick of it again minutes later. This time Stuart Hunterrsquos driving run from midfield found Millar open in the circle. He slipped the ball to the energetic Scott Leetch, who calmly slotted the ball into the goal to make it -.Limerick fought back and got themselves another goal before the half -time interval to make it -.After the restart the game had settled slightly and Ballynahinch started to get into a pattern of maintaining the ball effectively.With that, lsquoHinch were racking up the short corners, seven were won, but for some excellent defending and goalkeeping kept them at bay.With  minutes to go Ballynahinch took the lead again, this time through William Edgar.A few minutes later a piece of brilliance from Edgar made it - after a superb solo run matched with a spectacular finish.As expected, Limerick flooded men forward along with countless aerial passes, making it dficult for lsquoHinch to get out of their half.Limerick pulled one back with a short corner routine with five minutes remaining, but Ballynahinch had the ability to see out the game and lt the trophy for the third time in the clubrsquos history.A big thank you to all the supporters that spurred the men on in Dublin on Saturday, it was very much appreciated.

Itrsquos a great experience not to be missed.The material, including the discovery of  skeletons, has thrown up some interesting information on the Benedictine Abbey which occupied the site during the medieval period, as well as tantalising glimpses into the early Christian monastic site that was located there from the eighth century AD.Three trenches were excavated in the immediate vicinity of Holy Trinity Cathedral, two located in the old tennis courts and one located on the grass verge directly in line with the Cathedralrsquos west door, in advance of the replica of St Patrickrsquos Cross being installed.The trench on the verge revealed the existence of a substantial medieval cemetery with  skeletons being uncovered.Three of these were put forward for radiocarbon dating and the dates have recently been ed.The lowermost burial ed a date of - AD which indicates that this person lived and died before the Anglo-Norman invasion of  AD and before the present Abbey church was constructed on the site.This person would have lived at a time when the round tower mdash knocked down when the cathedral was refurbished around  mdash was still in use. The latest burial encountered ed a date of - AD showing that this person lived and died when the site was occupied by the Benedictine Abbey.Analysis of the skeletons is ongoing, but initial results of the latest burial indicate it to be a young, female, adult with severe dental trauma.The excavation in the tennis courts uncovered the kitchen and midden pit of the Benedictine Abbey.Site director Brian Sloan explained: ldquoA rich picture of medieval le was uncovered with masses of animal bone and pottery being recovered. We can use this evidence to build up a picture of the diet and everyday activities of the monks who lived and prayed here. The large pottery sherds have been painstakingly pieced together at QUB giving an idea of the shape, size and decoration of the vessels.He continued: ldquoA rich environmental picture is being established through the processing of the soil samples taken during the excavation. A multitude of blackberry seeds, sloe pips and fish bones have been recovered as well as charred wheat grains.Scientic techniques are now helping to identy and date the finds. An array of metalwork was recovered from the midden pit consisting of copper alloy and corroded iron artefacts, and these have been analysed and x-rayed. This has allowed us to see objects beneath the corrosion and the results have been quite startling. A number of items have been identied, including fine copper alloy dress pins, a socketed arrowhead, a horseshoe, a pair of iron shears and even aof chain with a suspension hook still attached.In addition, three samples mdash charred grain, charcoal and a fragment of twig mdash were put forward for radiocarbon dating.The twig fragment ed a date range of - AD which fits very well with the pottery types recovered from the midden pit. However, the charred grain and charcoal ed very similar dates of - AD and - AD respectively.This indicates that earlier activity relating to the early Christian monastic site of the th Century AD, when the original St Patrickrsquos Cross was erected, is there and waiting to be uncovered.A number of finds have now been placed on display in the High Cross Gallery at Down County Museum, in two new cases funded by the British Museum Trust, while research work continues on the collection of artefacts, dating from the Mesolithicthrough to modern times.This project was supported by the European Unionrsquos PEACE IV Programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body .Match-funding for this project has been provided by The Executive Office in Northern Ireland and the Department for Rural and Community Development in Ireland.To find out how to get involved in the excavation in August, contact Down County Museum on   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch teams are All Ireland champions  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH was at the centre of Irelandrsquos sporting world at the weekend.It was a case of doubles all round for the townrsquos rugby club.The lsquoHinch won the All-Ireland League Division B title and their fourths lted the coveted Crawford Cup at the Kingspan Stadium.Just to make it a Super Saturday, Ballynahinch Hockey Club travelled down to Dublin and lted the Irish Challenge Hockey Cup for the second year in succession to complete a memorable season for Mark Brownrsquos boys.The rugby first XV dealt with St Maryrsquos College without undue trouble at Ballymacarn Park to secure their place in the top flight of Irish club rugby.Their - victory prompted huge celebrations after skipper Aaron Cairns got his hands on the trophy.ldquoThis is massive for the club, said Cairns. ldquoAll the hard work this season has finally paid off.ldquoWe wouldnrsquot have got here without our coaches, Brian McLaughlin and Tom Rock, and all the backroom staff.ldquoThere is a lot that goes on behind the scenes and without that we couldnrsquot do it.ldquoWersquove learnt lessons from our time before in A and hopefully wersquoll take that back up with us and see how we get on, added Cairns.Indeed, the trick will be staying in A somewhat longer this time around mdash lsquoHinch managed three campaigns of mostly struggle before exiting in  mdash and that fresh challenge awaits Brian McLaughlinrsquos squad.Over at Ravenhill, an experienced fourths team had just enough in the tank to defeat local rivals Banbridge thirds - to keep the Crawford Cup in the Ballymacarn Park trophy cabinet for another year.The lsquoHinch were good value for their victory in a tough, uncompromising battle, but the lsquoHinchrsquos greater experience stood them in good stead.All heads then turned towards Dublin where the hockey club faced Limerick at Serpentine Avenue in the Irish Challenge Cup final.Manager Mark Brown sent his troops out full of confidence and goals from man of the match William Edgar , Scott Leetch and Matthew Martin were good enough to give them a - victory in an entertaining final.Edgarrsquos two pieces of inidual brilliance were worthy of winning any competition in a superb display of expansive, attacking hockey.This was Ballynahinchrsquos third Irish title in seven years mdash and by far the hardest to win.The game went back and forth at breakneck speed with goals soon starting to flow.lsquoHinch, always look the more composed side with former Instonians man Matthew Martin and the predatory Edgar having that touch of class.Limerick made a real go of it in the last five minutes, but Ballynahinch had the nous to see out the game and lt the crown for a third time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Calum wins heat at Mary Peters Track  ","story":"NEWCASTLE AC juniors attended the first meet of the Firmus Fab  Series at the Mary Peters Track on Thursday night, taking part in nine events collectively.Calum Cope won his heat in the U- boysrsquo  metre race.

The current area is unkempt and I share residentsrsquo views that it is a bit of an eyesore. I am concerned that what we are looking at here is a permanent bin lorry park.Cllr Curran said that while a number of Strangford Road residents were notied by planners about the plans for the site, there was no formal consultation. He said this must happen as soon as possible.In addition, he said those with ldquounderstandable concerns about the planning application require additional information and revealed he wants to know

could be used as a lorry park.He added: ldquoResidentsrsquo concern about this planning application need to be addressed and I fully understand where they are coming from.A council spokesman confirmed that the local authority sold part of its Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to allow the development of the proposed new Down High School.ldquoThe sale includes land which is currently used for staff parking at the front and side of the old workhouse, said the spokesman.ldquoThis planning application is to develop the remaining site under council ownership to provide parking for

This is undoubtedly the position of Roman Catholicism.ldquoThere are many doctrinal dferences between the Church of Ireland and the Church of Rome, the fundamental dference being that they preach and believe very dferent messages and ultimately cannot be united.ldquoAs Free Presbyterians, we would like to remind both those in the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church that good works do not save an inidual, the Lord Jesus Christ alone saves.ldquoTherefore, we conclude by beseeching those in St Paulrsquos Church of Ireland who love the Lord Jesus as their Saviour to not participate in any  unity march that would grieve the True and Living God.Fr McKinlay said this was the first time in his memory that there had been a protest against the walk.ldquoI think it is a sad reflection on le in todayrsquos world that men who preach the Christian gospel do not want others to walk with them, he remarked.ldquoI feel all of this is incredulous to say the least. There have never been protests about this walk in my time and I have been in Castlewellan for ten years.Fr McKinlay praised what he described as the ldquoexcellent community relations in Castlewellan and pointed out to a number of initiatives, such an inter-church choir, the Peace Bell and Peace Maze in the local forest park and a cross-community website involving all the churches in the Castlewellan area which was set up two years ago by the International Council of Churches under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 17%2C 1979  ","story":"EASTER mdash Down District sampled the start of what could be a record year in tourism when hundreds of thousands of day-trippers thronged into the area over the sun-drenched Easter holiday period.The first unbroken spell of sunny weather this year brought motorists flocking into the area mdash and left council tourism officials confident of a summer season boom.Newcastle was one of the biggest attractions over the holiday weekend and it was Easter Tuesday thatdrew the most people as thousands crammed into the resort to see the finish of the Circuit of Ireland Rally at the Slieve Donard Hotel.Forest parks at Tollymore, Castlewellan and Drumkeeragh were also a magnet, as were National Trust properties at Castleward, Mount Stewart and Rowallane Gardens in Saintfield.There were many tailbacks of traffic in many local towns, including Dundrum, Clough, Comber and Newtownards, and there bumper-to-bumper delays in bottleneck areas like Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and Newcastle.The Strangford ferry had the busiest ever period in its ten-year history as thousands of tourists used the crossing to drive up the Ards, or, coming in the opposite way, along the Lecale coast and into Newcastle.The two ferries made a total of  crossings on Monday alone, the highest ever, and it was an applaudable effort from all their staff that things went off without a hitch.Down Councilrsquos assistant tourist and recreation officer, Mr Frank Cunningham, was optimistic that this year would break all tourism records, providing the weather was kind.ldquoWe are all very hopeful for a tremendous year and are expecting some of the biggest ever crowds to converge on our resorts and attractions, he said.DOWNPATRICK mdash The programme for the St Patrickrsquos Festival in Downpatrick in five weeksrsquo time is taking shape and promises to be a dashing four-day bill to suit all tastes.ldquoIt is far from being just another town festival of bits and pieces, said organising committee vice-chairman Frank Connolly.ldquoFrom the opening procession to the open-air carnival four nights later it will be a fast-paced programme with many unique attractions that have neverbeen seen in the area before.The festival will open on Friday, May , with a through-town procession of floats and closes four days later with the carnival in Dunleath Park where the organisers promise that virtually everything thatcan happen will happen as long as it is entertaining.NEWCASTLE mdash Newcastle and District Ladies Circle held a very successful third annual meeting in the Brook Cottage Hotel recently.

July  celebrationsAlongside Ballymena, the capital stages a Twelfth demonstration every year.Other sizeable parades will take place in Lisnaskea , Pomeroy , Coleraine , Larneand Rathfriland \", says the statement.Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, Edward Stevenson, hailed the enhanced cultural experience offered by the yearly celebrations. “Once again this summer, the signicance of Orange traditions will be underlined by the scale of our parades,” he said.“Surely there is no other event on these islands that can bring such vast numbers of people onto the streets to enjoy our processions, either by taking part or simply to watch them go by. It is a custom which has been maintained for over  years, passed through generations, and will continue to be upheld for many years to come.”Mr Stevenson will be in attendance at the Ballyronan demonstration.The senior Orangeman added: “We continue to welcome an increasing number of international visitors to our celebrations who are keen to experience first-hand the spectacle of the biggest day in the parading calendar. “High calibre music provided by some of the finest marching bands will only add to the festival atmosphere. We look forward to another glorious Twelfth.”The  demonstrations on Friday  July , will be held in: Tandragee Belfast Lisnaskea Pomeroy Donemana Augher Coleraine Ballyronan Holywood Crossgar Rathfriland Kilkeel Larne Glenavy Carnlough Ballymena Ballymoney and Ahoghill.Northern Ireland electricity grid can now be run from state-owned Dublin control roomWarning that Northern Ireland farm subsidies could halve by  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingStricken Isle of Man TT racer Steve Mercer says it cant end like thisThese are the  bizarre items you can take on a plane from Belfast International AirportMan dies after three vehicle collision on NI roadlsquoIrsquoll stab you in your pregnant bellyrsquo, child tells NI teacherBomb scare in N.I. housing estate -

The seniors school can be found on Hickman Road, the juniors and nursery a short distance on in Victoria Road.School facilities include a full gym, a library, an IT suite, a sports hall, science laboratories, and nearby access to local sports facilities including athletics track, Penarth RFCrsquos rugby pitch and the International Sports Village in Cardf Bay.Traditionally the school was strictly boys only.

He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s. This is up to five times the UK average.The academic rigour extends to the staff too.

Marie Curie also provides support to people in their own homes, and its Information and Support Line now also features clinical nurse specialists who are available for any clinical support needed.The work to create the new cafeacute has been funded by the Hodge Foundation, who also supported the refurbishment of the hospicersquos Day Therapy and Outpatients Unit in .At the opening, cakes from the hospicersquos catering team were showcased, with staff, volunteers and patients joining Suzanne and the Hodge Foundation to enjoy welsh cakes and tea and coffee.Further works at the hospice, funded by a Legacy gt from the estate of Mrs Seaward have included the installation of a Spa bathroom on both inpatient units.There has also been further maintenance work carried out alongside the bathroom and cafeacute works. The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring. I wish the hospice every luck with their new venture, and hope it will encourage more people to talk about end of le with their loved ones.The Marie Curie cafeacute is currently open from .am to pm Monday to Friday, with plans to expand hours with trained volunteers.If you would like to volunteer, contact the hospice on    or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk volunteering article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

action ballot planned for   moy park workers  ","story":"More than , workers in Moy Park are to be balloted for strike action as frustration mounts over pay negotiations.The workers, mostly on the two main sites at Portadown and Dungannon, are to be balloted on whether they wish to take strike action within weeks.Moy Park is one of NI’s largest employers and, according to Unite, the union, there has been serious problems with management during negotiations.Sean McKeever, Unite Regional Officer representing his union’s membership at Moy Park sites, said the union would be balloting over ‘unreasonable management demands in ongoing pay negotiations’.“When Moy Park was sold by Brazilian meat-packing giant JBS SA to one of its own subsidiaries, Pilgrim’s Pride Corp of the USA, Unite the union forecasted that this would presage a broader onslaught on workforce terms and conditions. Sadly the accuracy of that forecast is now apparent to every Moy Park worker in NI.“From our first meetings with the incoming management team it was apparent that they were intent on attacking terms and conditions of workers in the region which remain among the best of any workforce in the UK agri-food industry. In recent pay negotiations they have brought forward proposals seeking to undermine Sht Allowances, Sickness scheme, Holiday entitlement, Attendance allowance, Nomi Statutory days and decent breaks – TCs that were hard won by this workforce over many years and which are simply not up for negotiation.“Moy Park’s workforce in NI has a strong and well-organised team of Unite workplace representatives. We recently defeated an attempt to ide maintenance engineers from the bargaining unit and saw off attempts to keep union officials off-site. Management need to think again – this is not a workforce that will stand by as they slash and burn their way in a race-to-the-bottom on rights and entitlements.“The company’s latest annual pre-tax profits were just short of £ million – an enormous increase of  percent on the year previously. Its current owners Pilgrim’s Pride declared net earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of  million in . These are not businesses that are struggling for survival, the attacks on workers’ pay and conditions are simply part of a drive to maximise profits and increase s for corporate shareholders.“Unite is now preparing the roll-out of a ballot on all-out strike action of our more than three thousand members working for Moy Park in NI. Management need to recognise the determination of this workforce before it leads to unnecessary and entirely avoidable disruption to their operations here”, Mr McKeever said.A Moy Park spokesperson said: “We are aware of the recent union statement and we will continue to engage with the union and work towards a negotiated agreement.”Former rugby chief gets MBE for service to sport Coremetrics

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ub_11.jpg","title":"we need a sea change and this is just the beginning","story":"Posted on Thursday April  by Ulster Business Ulster Business sits down with a host of top femalebusiness leaders at one of Ulster Bank’s DSE dinners to look at the challenges facing women entering the world of business, what change is needed and how far we’ve already come  ‘This is just the beginning’. That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ppb.jpg","title":"powered by talent making return to belfast","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business A host of top speakers will descend on Belfast in May for the second Powered by Talent event.The full day event – taking place at ICC Belfast on May  – has been signicantly expanded this year and will accommodate in excess of  attendees, making it the largest talent-focused conference on the island of Ireland and one of the highest profile events in the UK.Justin Rush, founding member of Powered By Talent and director of Abacus Talent Group, says: “Talent attraction and retention remains one of the biggest challenges businesses face.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
